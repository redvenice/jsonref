The SBS operation was authorised by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel. A source close to the Home Secretary said the 45 minutes during which the situation was resolved \u0027felt like 45 hours\u0027.The heavily-armed troops descended on to the tanker by rope from four Royal Navy helicopters after nightfall.The elite soldiers quickly rounded up the suspected hijackers and ended their mission after just nine minutes.The seven suspected hijackers seized on Sunday night were last night being questioned in separate police stations across Hampshire after the 750ft tanker moored at Southampton.A spokesman for Hampshire Police said: \u0027It was reported that a number of stowaways were on board, and they had made threats towards the crew.\u0027He added: \u0027All 22 crew members are safe and well and the vessel is now alongside in the port of Southampton. Investigators are speaking to the crew members to establish the exact circumstances of what happened.\u0027Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: \u0027I think this has got all the hallmarks of a situation where a number of stowaways are seeking political asylum, presumably in the UK. At some stage they got aggressive. Clearly no one knew at the time how aggressive they were, whether they were armed or not and what their motives were.\u0027In the discussions taking place between the ship\u0027s captain and the authorities in the UK – both police and the military – they will have decided at some stage the least risky option was to board the vessel using the special forces.\u0027The drama echoed a previous case involving stowaways which unfolded aboard a cargo ship in the Thames Estuary in December 2018. Four Nigerians had hidden aboard the Grande Tema in Lagos, and became disruptive as the ship entered UK waters. The four attempted to repel an SBS boarding party by threatening to infect them with HIV, but were eventually arrested and prosecuted. At least one made \u0027throat-slitting\u0027 gestures to crew, CCTV footage played in court showed. However, after an eight week trial at the Old Bailey they were cleared of attempting to hijack the ship and convicted of affray.Two were also found guilty of making threats to kill. They were jailed for a combined total of seven years.That case highlights potential difficulties in securing convictions under the hijacking legislation. "},{"url":null,"title":"Backlog thousands miss stamp duty holiday number mortgage deals halves","story":"Share this article It is currently taking buyers an average of 160 days – more than five months – to go from agreeing a sale to moving in, up from 95 days last year according to property data analysts TwentyCi.And as the stamp duty deadline draws closer, experts fear delays could spiral further.It means an estimated 325,000 property owners with sales agreed between September and January may fail to complete in time as they get caught in the logjam, at a cost of £4 billion to the economy, according to the data firm. At the same time, the total number of mortgage deals available has dropped 55 per cent since January, from 2,477 to 1,099, according to figures from analysts Defaqto.Many high street banks have axed deals for borrowers with small deposits of 5 or 10 per cent altogether.But there is also increasingly less choice for buyers with medium and even large deposits. There are now just 125 two-year deals for those with a 15 per cent deposit, down from 264 in March, according to separate data from Moneyfacts. The number of five-year deals for those who can put down 20 per cent has dropped from 257 to 164.Dominik Lipnicki, of advisers Your Mortgage Decisions, said: ‘Lenders appear to be worried about just how fragile the property market really is and if the current crisis will result in house price falls.‘We have seen a post-lockdown boost, aided by Rishi Sunak’s stamp duty scheme but many agree this may well have been a temporary recovery with darker times ahead.’A spokesman for banking body UK Finance said: ‘Rates offered will be influenced by several factors including the lender’s funding and operating costs, risk appetite and provision for any potential losses over the life of the loan.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Angela Merkel says Germany verge losing control coronavirus","story":"Share this articleGlobal report: Merkel says Germany faces ‘difficult months ahead’ in Covid fight | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Priti Patel wants increase counter espionage powers Britains FBI","story":"Share this article Foreign policy expert Dr Alan Mendoza said: \u0027Chinese and Russian spies have been operating in the UK for years, yet our current confused approach to policing has failed to see a single operative successfully prosecuted.\u0027Dr Mendoza heads up the Henry Jackson Society, a think tank which is focused on supporting democracy against threats from China and Russia.He added: \u0027Handing them control of counter-intelligence policing shows that the Government is beginning to understand the scale of interference from China and Russia.\u0027The proposal comes as the House of Lords prepares for a second reading of the Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill MPs have raised concerns over the Bill, which aims to protect undercover operatives from prosecution if they are forced to break the law on operations.The Bill also seeks to define circumstances in which operatives can commit crime, replacing various pieces of overlapping legislation.It will cover 13 law enforcement and government agencies, including the police, the National Crime Agency, the armed forces and the prison service.Home Sec wants to give UK\u0027s \u0027FBI\u0027 new powers to tackle Russian \u0026amp Chinese spies"},{"url":null,"title":"Moose appears walk water Alaska","story":"Share this article To enable them to use the shallowest streams, many owners have boats using water jets rather than traditional propellers, which are at risk of being damage if they strike the bottom. The jet propulsion systems suck up water from underneath the boat and shoot it out at high pressure from the rear.

The title comes from the Italian conidere, which means sharing, and the images show groups of people living together in isolation, whether they are families, single people or mixed groups.Every picture belongs to two authors, the home-based photographer and the subject, and they share the whole process of creation of the final picture via a video call. The subjects their time, their life, their intimacy and their image, first with the photographer and then with society. This process, in addition to the narration of the day-to-day cohabitation of the subjects, serves the social and community purpose of sharing your own mental and physical condition, from inside to outside, similar to the very human need to interact with the rest of the community.Rudy: “It has been a hard time. We have tried to spend time together dedicating ourselves to our passions in our small house in Florence. We managed to train in the little space we had at home. It was difficult but we succeeded and so we were able to vent our anxieties and emotions of that difficult moment.”Some families managed to reunite after the Italian government imposed lockdown measures on 9 March 2020, while others were separated, with some family members left stranded in remote places. In other cases, single people were forced to cohabit with strangers. During the health crisis, the meaning attached to the word cohabitation has changed, creating new relations from a forced sharing, in particular, of spaces, habits, feelings and fears.Giulia was able to observe at first hand the great love between her parents, who in lockdown celebrated 47 years of marriage. But, for the first time, it was she who took care of them, not vice versa. Maria Vittoria sewed the masks using the online “tutors” (video tutorials), found by Giulia, while she was taught the secrets of the garden. She also discovered the joys of Netflix.This picture was taken in the countryside of Reggello, in the province of Florence, at the Casellina Laghi farm and agriturismo.

The six puppies, Frido, Orso, Storti, Benni, Sumio and Brasco, should have gone for adoption during lockdown but instead remained in the family. During the lockdown, they started a wine company.Teresa: “We had recently left for Spain, arrived in the desert and started our journey. We heard about the health emergency in Italy, but by then it was too late. So we decided in a meeting that we would continue the journey and when possible we would come back to Italy. We were afraid we could not return home, but we continued our journey away from the health emergency.”Prisca, a photographer, and Val, a stylist and model, live and work in London. During quarantine, they worked from home and organised photoshoots for their clients. Both decided to spend the lockdown living near work, painfully distant from their loved ones.Anna: “Diego and I are school teachers and Flor is a sax player. During the lockdown the garden was our salvation. There we were free to share our time while maintaining personal spaces. I was very worried about my relatives in Italy and every day I watched the news from my house in Uruguay”.Fulvia: “If before we were planning the next journey, at this moment we were only hoping to be able to see Fulvia’s family in Italy again at some point. Fulvia called every evening with her family back home comparing the numbers in Italy and Germany with the ones of the day before. One of us lost the job, and the other one was lucky enough to be able to work remotely.But yet we were the lucky ones, as we spent our days in our living room learning the things we thought weren’t so important as our job or our life outside. So we practiced singing, playing the guitar, started indoor gardening, creating handmade goods and taking care of each other, in short, we learnt how to give value to our time.”Lucrezia and Oliver have their own company, Oliver Party Express, which rents furniture. They took advantage of the quarantine to work behind closed doors in the laboratory on new projects. The laboratory, located a few metres from both their homes, allows them to produce new objects. Theirs is a place of work that has become something much more.Massimo Ferrara, 25, a musician and music producer of the crew Lost Dogz, and Arianna Parrotta, 27, a photographer, are pictured with their dog, Truc, in the garden. The couple returned from South America, where they were travelling, during the lockdown – their return was not without difficulty.

While in the villa they did activities, such as yoga, study and play board games, to help with their fears and emotions. Pictured are, on the sides, Mauro Sarasin, 51, and Cosma Maria Antonietta Callegari, 64, and daughters Eleonora Sarasin, 24, and Veronica Gambaro, 34, who wears the costume of her animation group “Barbie atomiche”. Veronica says: “Even a lay eye can sense that I have an eventful life. I was partying until the night they called the red zones. I was in Trentino. The quarantine has made me rediscover my home ... the peace of an evening in bed reading with a lighted candle or watching a movie with my sister. Now I no longer go out every night. I also rediscovered the pleasure of being at the table with my parents. Working far away, I never came home, and I missed lunches. Emotionally it was a gift, the quarantine. My family has benefited a lot from it.” Martina: “We lived our lockdown locked in our house outside Padua. Walter and I create special effects for the world of cinema. For example, this is an enlarged reconstruction of Rita Levi Montalcini. Luckily we have our own laboratory near home. During the lockdown we were able to work every day and finish some personal projects.”Just before the lockdown, Francesca and her friend Andrea left Milan to join the Della Seta family in Carrara. The two lived in self-quarantine for 15 days in an isolated apartment. They then went to the family home to join grandmother AnnaMaria, Massimo (father), Patrizia (mother) and Tommaso (brother). They spent most of their days together in the garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/787bd2a5e5995a3265de837e2c09abdd6c3e833d/8_394_1070_642/master/1070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4b0bb4e36b420272ded9a5a1473c22f","title":"between art fashion photographs from the collection of carla sozzani","story":"Over more than 40 years, Carla Sozzani, the noted Italian editor, publisher and collector, assembled one of the country’s most important photography collections.

But the sum was a fraction of the $2.3bn reported for the same quarter last year.BP said the market was showing signs of recovery after reaching a nadir in the second quarter. Oil prices averaged $42 a barrel in the third quarter, up from an average of $30 over the previous quarter, when BP slumped to a $6.7bn underlying loss that included a string of writedowns on its exploration assets.The company slashed the value of its assets to reflect its view that oil price forecasts would be below expectatins as a result of the pandemic. The write-offs led to a net loss of $16.8bn in the second quarter, but in the absence of further writedowns BP has reported a net loss of $500m.Investor jitters over the global industry, and BP’s bold climate targets, have caused the oil company’s share price to tumble to 26-year lows of 200p a share in recent weeks.BP said it would keep its idend in place after reducing it by two-thirds in August for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.It also plans to cut 10,000 jobs from its global business at a cost of $1.4bn. The company’s headcount has reduced by about 2,800 people so far this year, of whom 2,100 have elected to leave under the company’s redundancy programme.

But then reading reasserted its power and people found they could escape through books, and sales have been booming ever since.”Overall online book sales and e-book revenues, from readers using devices such as Kindle, were “significantly higher” but the group would reveal its figures.Newton said certain books had captured the mood of many during the lockdown, such as Rutger Bregman’s Humankind: A Hopeful History, Polly Samson’s Greek island-set A Theatre for Dreamers and a resurgence in popularity of Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking To White People About Race, as the Black Lives Matter movement took hold.Other titles to do well included cookery books by Paul Hollywood and the restaurant Dishoom, as people looked for indoor hobbies as bars, pubs and restaurants were shut. “Books turned out to be essential components of so many people’s periods of being at home and rediscovering the joy of reading,” Newton said.Alastair Reid, media analyst at Investec, said: “Despite early investor concerns over the impact of Covid-19 on demand, and Bloomsbury’s ability to fulfil it, the group’s performance continues to confound these fears.“The performance in fundamental terms reflects the strength in demand for its titles, alongside a surge in demand for digital products.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818ebba036776c569f8c79e6844afba5d3c3f66a/1067_1077_2958_1775/master/2958.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=a384b598df192b53ba6956ca7e878667","title":"how qanons conspiracies gained traction uk social media","story":"The theories on social media give readers permission not to believe anything they see in traditional mediaWhen Barack Obama recently told a rally in Pennsylvania that, were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to be elected, they – we – would no longer have to worry about “the crazy things” Donald Trump and his supporters say, he was addressing a thirsty crowd in need of reassurance that a cool draught of sensible was on its way.“You’ll be able to go about your lives,” Obama said, “knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals ruling the world … Think about that: the president of the United States retweeted that. What! What?!”Think about that, indeed. For most of us, the idea that a president, or indeed anyone else, might support the followers of a theory that high-profile celebrities, Obama among them, are involved in a global paedophile ring channelling kidnapped children through underground tunnels and pizza parlours harvesting their organs, and getting high on an adrenal byproduct of their terror, is a “What! What?!” moment.QAnon is a wide-ranging and baseless internet conspiracy theory that has been on the fringes of rightwing internet communities for years, but its visibility has exploded in recent months amid the social unrest and uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic.QAnon has its roots in previously established conspiracy theories, some relatively new and some a millennium old. QAnon evolved out of Pizzagate and includes many of the same basic characters and plotlines without the easily disprovable specifics.But QAnon also has its roots in much older antisemitic conspiracy theories. The idea of the all-powerful, world-ruling cabal comes straight out of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fake document used throughout the 20th century to justify antisemitism. Another QAnon canard is a modern remix of the age-old antisemitic blood libel.“Q”, posing as a government insider with top security clearance, has made more than 4,000 posts so far. Cryptic and elliptical, they often consist of a long string of leading questions designed to guide readers toward discovering the “truth” for themselves through “research”. It’s a kind of participatory internet scavenger hunt with perceived high stakes and a ready-made community of fellow adherents.Experts in conspiracy theories point out belief in QAnon is far from common. The largest Facebook groups had approximately 200,000 members in them before Facebook banned them. When Twitter took similar action, it limited features for approximately 150,000 accounts.While most QAnon followers will not engage in violence, many already have, or have attempted to, which is why the FBI identified the movement as a potential domestic terror threat. Participation in QAnon also often involves vicious online harassment campaigns against perceived enemies, which can have serious consequences for the targets.QAnon is gaining traction as a political force in the Republican party in the US. Media Matters has compiled a list of 77 candidates for congressional seats who have indicated support for QAnon and at least one of them, Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, will in all likelihood be elected in November 2020.If this is your first introduction to the ideas behind QAnon, you may be incredulous. Maybe, like Obama, your response is to mock the people sharing its ideas. But that would be wrong. Ideas don’t go away just because not everyone believes in them. And we have centuries of evidence on the persistence of conspiracies as ideas – and the persistence of what feeds conspiracy beliefs: fear of “the other” translated into racism and antisemitism a reactionary response to cultural change a fight response to feeling out of control during societal crisis.For me, the worry is less that the US president is circulating conspiracy theories, but how quickly QAnon ideas were seeded through millions of inidual Facebook users this summer, grooming some from vaguely reactionary to off-the-scale truther. The mutability of QAnon’s ideas and its reach through Facebook has been able to sweep up so many people across the UK to march to #SaveOurChildren or rally against mask-wearing.For the past five years, my research has looked at how strangers talk to each other about politics on Facebook. Focused on four constituencies through three general elections, I tracked public conversations between iniduals through politicians’ Facebook pages. I watched the increased polarisation of those conversations, and with it increased partisanship and sectarianism. The largely civil debates I saw in 2015 were mostly gone by 2017. In 2019, I was struck by how memes were replacing discussion with ideology, and how radical ideas from ultra-right US Facebook pages were being circulated via iniduals in these constituencies.Returning to Facebook and those same local party pages this summer, I expected to see pro-Trump, anti-media, anti-migrant posts on some of the further-right pages in my watchlist, and I did. But honestly, even after five years of lurking in other people’s filter bubbles, I wasn’t ready for the stream of anti-everything anger I saw, nor for how easily conspiracy-driven ideas were crisscrossing the Atlantic (and the Pacific) via Facebook’s algorithms favouring negativity and outrage.Facebook user J had shared the QAnon post cited above on her feed. J is in Wales but the post came from “Mama Wolf” in the US. J had been liking and sharing anti-migrant content from Ukip Brighton and Hove, now she was connected to Mama Wolf and both were sharing pro-Trump, anti-Democrat, anti-media, anti-vaxxer, anti-mask wearing, anti-Black Lives Matter protests memes.What’s particularly concerning is that we just do not know how many Facebook users are being exposed to QAnon ideas. The bubble communities we each inhabit on Facebook shield us from alternative views to our own we do not see what we are not already predisposed to see. We are less likely to see what our neighbour or sister or colleague is seeing.Once, we watched the news on TV we saw wars and children starving and, while our thinking about the why or how of those events varied, that they were happening was a shared truth. Now we inhabit a world in which anyone – even a president – might ask us to believe events are happening that we can’t see, purely on the basis that the media is hiding it from us.Only seeing the headline “crazy things” about QAnon makes it easy for us to dismiss it from the safety of our cognitive bubbles. But the threat from QAnon is that it further erodes the link between what we can see to be true and what we will believe to be true. The problem is not that if someone believes QAnon’s crazy things, they’ll believe anything, but that QAnon gives them permission to choose not to believe anyone. Truth is what their gut tells them, and reality is a choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2529548c51c578a3573ab4514d9732194374cdf/0_906_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=c0f029609a6d4b0e07c5c91cfa06de63","title":"wales covid competence inspiring independence trust","story":"As a Welsh person living in England, I feel envious of my loved ones united behind a government they can trust On Friday Wales began a two-week national “firebreak” Covid lockdown in an attempt to give some breathing space to its health service, which risks being overwhelmed by the rise in cases. It has not been without controversy – a ban on supermarkets selling non-essential items was criticised over the weekend. In the English press, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, and the Welsh government have been labelled as “clowns” who are trying to turn Wales “into a wartime, command economy: East Germany, except not as efficient, and with more sheep” (note the tedious xenophobia).The criticism over the essential items rule is less about lockdown and more about what iniduals consider “essential” during times of crisis (the government has now indicated that supermarkets will be allowed flexibility – hardly the actions of a Soviet dictatorship).Speaking to friends and family in Wales, most people feel the Welsh government knows what it is doing. It is following the scientific advice from its own Technical Advisory Cell, as well as from experts on the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). That is not to say that restrictive lockdowns are easy on anyone – small businesses are worried they will not survive – but there is faith that the government has the best interests of the people at heart and is doing what it can to bring case numbers down. Compliance with measures such as mask-wearing has been high, adding to a feeling of collective dedication to the nation’s wellbeing.As a Welsh person on the other side of the border, I can’t help but feel a bit jealous of my loved ones still living there. It must be nice to have a government you trust, which collaborates with other parties and with the public, and communicates through clear, carefully considered announcements. The lockdown may be restrictive – and will certainly be experienced differently in Cardiff and Swansea than it will in the Valleys or the villages of Snowdonia – but wherever you are in Wales, you can be sure the scientific advice is being followed. In England, people do not have that luxury. The Tories looked at the same advice, and rejected it.Of course it is hard. My mother and one of my brothers, who is autistic, live close to one another but on different sides of the border. Because my brother was already in a regional lockdown, he hasn’t seen my mother for weeks, and I haven’t seen him since Christmas. As for my dad, stepmum and youngest brother: who knows when I’ll next see them. To miss your loved ones like this is a pain I’d never experienced before, but it is offset by the knowledge that their country is doing what it can to protect them.Throughout all this, I have noticed a shift in how Wales is perceived by Welsh people, in whichever country they live. Though I always saw Wales as a distinct nation, I have never spent so much time thinking about the border before. For most of my life it has felt porous: now it is not so.The measures banning travel into Wales are anti-virus, not anti-people. Covid poses a threat to small, rural populations with high numbers of older people, especially after the summer tourist season. Despite jokes on social media, Welsh people aren’t hoping to “build a wall”: they just want to keep the disease at bay.The way we conceive of the land of our birth is shifting. A friend in Gwynedd says he never felt such a strong sense of Welshness before the pandemic. There’s a sense of pride, too, in how Welsh people have come together to support laws made for Wales by Wales, while Westminster flounders, bluffs and fosters ision. The Covid-19 crisis has exposed the benefits of devolution: the powers Wales has to enact protective measures were previously unknown to many of us – even the former first minister Carwyn Jones said he had been unaware Wales could impose its own quarantine rules on people arriving from elsewhere. The pandemic has also allowed the Welsh government to take its own moral stand on issues close to the public’s heart: last week, the Senedd voted to ensure free school meal provision for school holidays up to and including Easter 2021.Support for independence is rising, too, and there are now “indy-curious” Labour voters. YesCymru, the campaign for an independent Wales, has seen huge increases in support. “People have seen that the Senedd in Wales is much more competent at running Wales’s affairs than Westminster, and we can do so with more empathy and compassion as well,” Siôn Jobbins, chair of YesCymru, tells me. “We’ve seen how a small country like New Zealand has succeeded in tackling Covid-19 even though Wales’s tax intake per head is higher than theirs, and they don’t ‘benefit’ from any of the so-called advantages of Westminster rule.”Jobbins says that 2021 will be an interesting year in the nation’s history. Welsh people will be keenly watching Scotland and wondering what life will be like being tethered to England following a potential Scottish departure. “Westminster is already stripping the Welsh parliament of its powers through the internal market bill,” Jobbins says. “In a few years’ time, Wales will either be independent or incorporated into England with direct Westminster rule – devolution won’t hold.”Covid-19 has given Wales a glimpse of what self-determination and autonomy could look like, and it’s inspiring. In times of great fear and uncertainty, having politicians that you feel you can trust is no small thing, and is not easily forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22541583ab431a442c7be666a70d0cfe8cc7cb2e/62_5_1577_947/master/1577.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2d514d046b86f4460cfc8b1e9f57e1d0","title":"bp leads energy companies preparing two major uk carbon capture projects","story":"17m tonnes of carbon dioxide to be stored beneath the North Sea every yearAfter decades spent extracting fossil fuels from the UK’s North Sea, a consortium of oil companies is preparing to pump Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions back beneath the seabed to help meet the government’s climate ambitions.BP has set out plans to lead an alliance of energy companies in siphoning off the carbon dioxide from factory flues under new plans in which almost half the UK’s industrial emissions will be stored beneath the North Sea from 2026.The veteran North Sea oil extractor is leading a partnership including Italy’s state oil company Eni, Norway’s Equinor, National Grid, Royal Dutch Shell and French energy company Total in a plan to transport 17m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year from two separate carbon capture projects based in the Teesside and Humber industrial clusters on England’s east coast.At Teesside, BP will work with the same oil companies, in a separate venture, to capture up to 10m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from the industrial cluster – equivalent to the same emissions produced from the energy used by 3m UK homes – from the mid-2020s.Meanwhile, at the Humber a separate alliance including National Grid, Equinor and power generator Drax hopes to capture at least 17m tonnes of CO2 from hundreds of refineries and factories.Andy Lane, BP’s head of carbon capture solutions, said the project represents a “significant milestone” towards developing the offshore infrastructure needed to safely store carbon, and the oil industry’s “willingness to come together and collaborate wherever possible” to contribute to the UK’s climate goals.Carbon capture and storage is considered vital to the UK’s legally binding target to create a carbon neutral economy by 2050. It would also be “virtually impossible” for the world to meet its climate targets without it, according to the International Energy Agency.There are still only 20 projects in commercial use worldwide but the IEA believes that in the last three years plans for more than 30 commercial carbon capture facilities have come forward, representing a potential investment of about $27bn (£20.7bn).The UK government has promised £800m to decarbonise at least two heavy-industry “carbon clusters”, the first in 2025 and the second by 2030, falling short of calls from MPs and the government’s official independent climate advisers at the committee on climate change to roll out multiple carbon capture projects within the next five years.The Northern Endurance Alliance has applied for funding from the government’s £170m industrial decarbonisation challenge which was set up this time last year. The support is part of the government’s £4.7bn industrial strategy challenge fund which was set up by the government to address the biggest barriers to the UK’s future productivity and earning power.• This article was amended on 27 October 2020. An earlier version mistakenly said that the Drax coal-fired power plant would be involved in the Humber estuary carbon capture project Drax’s coal units are set to close in March 2021, before carbon capture begins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bed1989c4822bce7802b4d386715498218a19a4e/196_329_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f00950697b3161dc4f428504d1fe5f40","title":"wall of the wild animals on the us mexico border in pictures aoe","story":"Mexican photographer Alejandro Prieto has captured the erse wildlife threatened by Donald Trump’s barrier, winning a number of awards, including the Fritz Pölking prize, with his project Border Wall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2f04765a919dd94e5f7e5effc16a23a3cd132e7/120_168_5407_3243/master/5407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc41932124ac6d4ce4e4efdb090e365e","title":"while we were getting high britpop and 90s style in pictures","story":"Photographer Kevin Cummins spent the 90s documenting the rise and fall of Cool Britannia for NME.

Then, when he did, slowly, he mixed them. Not so much confused but resourceful when he couldn’t find the word in one language he just used the other, creating Italian and English word-sandwiches, which, despite knowing better, made me smile – or worse, laugh, and he would scowl at me. But no scowl was greater than the one when I told him he was lucky that he was half-Italian and half-English. He scrunched his face up, but didn’t make any noise – just stared – then walked away. A few minutes later, he came back into the kitchen, reinforced with a toy. “I am half nothing,” he told me. “Sono tutto Italiano, and all English.”This was a few years ago now, but I flash back often, especially when something I say or do is met with a dark scowl. Aged nine, he not only speaks two languages, but he is now the one laughing: at my imperfect Italian and Vincenzo’s great but accent-soaked English, but also at himself his intentional mixing, bi-lingual swearing, his choice of two words from both languages.The choosing is particularly noisy around food and at the table, the setting for so much laughter and silent scowling. Also when he helps me cook, which happens less often as I’d like to say, because I am so often impatient, or working to a deadline. In fact, this is not a column about me encouraging my child to cook, but about Luca asking me to let him spezzare (break) the chocolate for the pudding, il budino. Why use only one good-sounding word when you have two?The Vocabolario Treccani notes that budino comes from the English “pudding”, under the influence of the French boudin. The origins are uncertain, but it certainly meant a sausage originally a blood one. In the same way that English black pudding is related to pudding, Italian sanguinaccio – blood sausage – is related to sweet sanguinaccio: a rich, dense budino made with blood and chocolate. While in England pudding signifies a universe of different and wondrous forms, the Italian budino signifies a softly set preparation, which can be made of various things. The Vocabolario Treccani goes on to describe budino as prepared with flour or other ingredients (rice, semolina, potatoes, ricotta, almonds, chocolate, milk, eggs, sugar) and cooked in a mould in the oven, a bagnomaria, or simply over a low heat, which is what I, what we, do.The magazine La Cucina Italiana promises you can make this budino in a mould and invert it on to a plate. It is my failing, I’m sure, that I have never had success in doing this, unless I double the cornflour, which means I lose the soft, tender wobble, which is part of the pleasure of this untroubled budino. And I like it served in a big bowl in the middle of the table, ready to be dolloped into bowls. It is even better served with thick cream. Just remember there are many words, in both languages, to describe this budino or pudding – many of them funny, all good, all whole.In a pan, heat the milk until it almost boils. Meanwhile, in another pan, melt the butter and sugar over a low flame until they turn to liquid, remove from the heat and whisk in the cornflour, making sure there are no lumps.Still off the heat, gradually add the milk to the buttersugarcornflour mixture, whisking constantly.Put the pan back over a low flame and, always stirring, bring it back to an almost-boil, which should take about six minutes. Add the chocolate and whisk strongly for another minute so it melts. Scrape into a bowl or mould, or six inidual glasses or cups, and chill for at least five hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42207eaf23e4b15d077dd58725306dd3b359efc9/0_506_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e57c35e4b81e8b34ed0b93042ff9cb46","title":"burnley tottenham hotspur premier league match report","story":"Tottenham’s prolific away form eluded them in an evenly contested encounter against bottom three Burnley, though the ever-reliable Son Heung-min came to their rescue with a an opportunist winner 15 minutes from the end. Son is now the Premier League’s top scorer with eight while Spurs shoot half a dozen places up the table as a result.That was tough for Burnley to take, because despite not registering a goal at Turf Moor this season they were enjoying the better of the chances before Son struck from a set piece. Harry Kane, whose header set up Son’s scoring chance to record yet another assist between the pair, had just cleared a James Tarkowski effort off the line in what amounted to the nearest the game had come to an opening goal. Kane went down the other end to change all that by meeting Erik Lamela’s corner to set up Son’s close range finish, leaving the home side disappointed after managing to hold a side who won their last two away games 5-2 and 6-1 for well over an hour.“Three very important points,” was José Mourinho’s verdict. “This was the kind of match with all the ingredients to drop points, a cold rainy night in an empty stadium with opponents who defend very well. I knew from the start we wouldn’t be allowed to play the way we wanted to play, but we wanted very much to win. We always do. I don’t change my speech. We want to win every game, and when you have a combination like Kane and Son you will always have a chance.”With Josh Brownhill booked for bringing down Tanguy Ndombele with barely a couple of minutes on the clock, Ashley Barnes was lucky not to receive at least the same punishment after catching Toby Alderweireld in the face with his elbow as he jumped for a high ball. The Spurs defender was left with a boxer’s cut just below his right eyebrow, and as medics worked to stem the flow of blood and wrap a Terry Butcher-style bandage around Alderweireld’s head there would have been countless opportunities for VAR to check the incident. The result was simply play-on when the player was fit to continue. Mourinho managed to look concerned and unimpressed at the same time.The Tottenham manager would have been more incensed had his side gone behind when Barnes put the ball in the net five minutes later, though the score was correctly ruled out for offside. There was no need for VAR to check the linesman’s decision either, since Barnes and a couple of his teammates were ahead of the visitors’ back line.Tottenham managed to pin Burnley back in their own half for much of the early part of the game without quite managing to find the telling final ball their snappy approach work merited. The home side had a let-off when Son could not react quickly enough when an attempted Nick Pope clearance went straight to him and when the same player found himself in a similarly threatening situation after half an hour Ben Davies’s pass from the left went behind him.This was the fixture last season when Mourinho was publicly critical of record signing Ndombele’s overall contribution, though now the France midfielder appears to be fully in favour, at the expense of Dele Alli. The England player did not even make the trip to Lancashire, fully fit but left out of the squad, though with Ndombele full of confidence and running and Gareth Bale in reserve on the bench it is hard to argue Spurs are currently short of attacking options. “It hurts me to leave good players out, but we have another match on Thursday, we don’t have to risk everyone,” Mourinho said.When Ndombele was caught in possession by Brownhill on the edge of the area, it took a good save from Hugo Lloris to keep out Ashley Westwood’s low drive. Lloris was in action again just before the break, this time keeping out a Johann Gudmundsson effort. The Iceland midfielder was never likely to score, but at least Burnley were working the opposition goalkeeper. By the time the interval arrived, with Kane frequently deep or wide, Pope was still to face a shot on target despite Spurs enjoying two-thirds of the possession.When Mourinho sent on a substitute for the last half hour it was not Bale but Lamela. Burnley were continuing to threaten at that point, albeit from distance, although it took an alert block from Alderweireld to prevent a Barnes shot from the edge of the area reaching its target. Tarkowski managed to meet Westwood’s corner too, just not in such a way that he could properly direct a header from inside the six yard line. Davies had to block from Westwood as Burnley passed the ball neatly around the Tottenham area, before Tarkowski reached Westwood’s corner but found Kane standing on the line. Burnley probably thought they had done enough to deserve at least a draw, but goals change games and Son’s took Spurs up to the dizzy heights of fifth, while Burnley’s inability to score is as worrying as only having a single point after five games.“I was disappointed to let in a soft goal after defending so well,” Sean Dyche said. “But there are signs we are beginning to play well again, we kept a very good team quiet for most of the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b7ebdfc17fd7725775869c523f39beaec8d2e8e/0_102_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b92c04ae0c560221b28146daa64ecff6","title":"uk covid policy for children in detention cruel and inhumane says un expert","story":"Solitary confinement to stop virus spread increases risk of self-harm and suicide and could have a lifelong impact, M0J warnedThe UK government’s policy of allowing children in detention to be locked alone in their cells for up to 23 hours a day under emergency Covid-19 measures is “extreme and inhumane” and could lead to lifelong mental health damage, according to the UN special rapporteur on torture and leading child health experts.Since March, facilities have been able to keep children as young as 12 confined alone in their cells for all but around 40 minutes a day. The measures, which were put in place to stop potential Covid-19 outbreaks, affect around 500 under 18-year-olds in youth detention and another 4,000 18-21-year-olds held in adult prisons.Prof Nils Melzer, the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, told the  that solitary confinement is so damaging to children that it should never have been seen as a reasonable response to the threat of Covid-19 infections.“Its use should be exceptional and in most cases there should be different measures to stop the spread of Covid. These kinds of stress factors are likely to affect this young generation for decades to come. If they spend a year like this it could affect their whole life.”In response, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said that children in custody are now spending on average four hours each day out of their cells, with plans for that to increase. But lawyers have told the  that some children and young people are still being regularly locked up for 22 hours a day. The situation worsens when staff are sick or have to isolate, they said.“I haven’t spoken to any children in prisons in recent weeks who are getting out for more than two hours a day every single day,” said Laura Janes, head of legal at the Howard League, which runs a helpline for children and young people in custody. “I speak to child after child, they sound so tired of doing nothing, I can hear the lethargy. Time is losing its meaning for them,” she said.Sean* was 15 when he was remanded into custody at a secure training centre (STC), a setting designed to give teenagers a rehabilitative programme of education and vocational training, with family visits. However, when he arrived he was immediately confined alone to his cell. After three weeks, Sean says he felt that his mind was starting to unravel.“The first three to four months it was 23 hours a day in my cell. You get taken for a walk to get some air but you don’t talk to anybody but the guard. It started to really affect me,” he said.Dr Alison Steele is a consultant paediatrician and officer for child protection at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which alongside the British Medical Association, has called for an end to the solitary confinement of children in detention.“It is very clear that solitary confinement is harmful to children and young people,” she said. “It damages their health and increases the risk of self-harm and suicide.” In early 2020, before the pandemic, the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, warned children in custody were being kept in segregation for very long periods.There are also fears for the thousands of teenagers detained in adult prisons who are being kept in isolation in their cells. Last week, Clarke also warned that the Covid-19 restrictions currently in place at adult prisons across the country risked doing “irreparable damage to the mental health of a lot of prisoners”.Caroline Liggins, head of the youth team at Hodge Jones \u0026amp Allen solicitors, said she is gravely concerned for the mental health of many of her teenage clients detained in adult prisons.“They just sit there with their mental health deteriorating, no education, no family visits. In Wormwood Scrubs there was a total lockdown. One 18-year-old there tested positive for Covid in the past week and received no medical treatment. He was just left locked in his cell,” Liggins said.One of her clients, who is 21, said: “During the lockdown we were only let out every other day for 30 mins. They wouldn’t allow us to take any books out of the library and all family meetings were stopped. All meetings with lawyers were delayed. This had effects on everyone’s cases as they all got pushed back. It was inhumane, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”Despite saying that Covid-19 restrictions were being lifted in youth detention facilities, in July the MoJ extended the rules allowing young offender institutions (YOIs) and STCs to keep children in their cells until March 2022. The MoJ said the legislation would only be used if needed to ensure that any new Covid outbreaks could be swiftly contained.Campaigners and lawyers acknowledge that lockdown was a difficult situation for prison management. One group that works with young people in prisons, Kinetic Youth, said they had been supported by inidual governors to run face to face projects throughout the lockdown.The MoJ said in response: “Young people spend at least four hours a day engaging in out of room activities, and we are looking to increase this when it is safe to do so. They also take part in meaningful activity when they are in their room – including increased access to video calls with family and support services.YOIs and STCs began face to face programmes last week but the MoJ said there would be regional variations in delivery.As the prisoners spoken to by the  wanted to remain anonymous the spokesman said the ministry could not investigate the inidual cases.*Name changed to protect anonymity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed974eada32db90b4cc9945bf3fe870f2429a8f1/0_243_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9caec63e43f9e7227576ad9faf9d1801","title":"im doing my bit to create a fairer healthier planet meet four ethical investors determined to make a difference","story":"Whether you’re into renewable energy or organic food, we can all enjoy the buzz of backing companies making a positive impact on the world. What’s more, there are now more options than ever for putting your money where your values areStereotypes die hard. A misperception persists that investors are staid men in grey suits. Even when it comes to investing in ethical or sustainable funds, many people still assume that only wealthy philanthropists have the luxury of being able to do so.But the democratisation of investing means that these days anyone can make an informed, empowered decision about how to put their extra cash to good use. Here are four everyday investors who decided to put their money where their values are, by investing with Triodos Bank.At that time he was working in an engineering capacity on flood plain risk analysis and clean air projects. Being involved in the sustainability sector meant he was already keenly aware of the climate emergency, and it felt right to put his money into something that aligned with his beliefs, personally and professionally.At the same time, he had been attending some green community events in Bristol, where he had heard about Triodos Bank, and its ethical ethos. He and his wife decided to sign up, opening a Triodos Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA, and later a Triodos current account. The ISA was part of their long-term financial planning as they knew they could put money away for five years plus.Sian Herschel, 43Having spent much of her career working in funding for organisations such as the Fairtrade Foundation and Comic Relief, Sian Herschel is no stranger to impact investing. These roles saw her making decisions about how charitable funds should be invested in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, she worked on helping small-scale farmers improve the quality of their products or get a fair price. “I’m very passionate about the impact that social enterprises can have,” she says.This interest in positive social impact spills over into her personal finances too. “For me, it’s really important to know where my money is, and how it’s being used,” she says, citing Triodos’s transparency as a key factor in her decision to invest with the bank. “That was number one in terms of criteria. The second was that I strongly believe that it’s not enough to just try to ensure that your money isn’t being used in a negative way. It’s more important and also more interesting, to be honest, to invest in positive action in businesses that are actively not only trying to do no harm, but actually trying to do good.”Herschel and her partner, who live in Buckinghamshire with their two boys, have a few different ISAs with Triodos, including its Innovative Finance ISA (IFISA), which can be used to hold crowdfunding investments tax free. They might use money from their Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA if they ever wanted to start a business or buy a property, or to help pay for their children’s education.Jacqui Furneaux, 70 “I used to walk past the building every day on my way to the library,” says Jacqui Furneaux, speaking about the Triodos Bank UK head office in Bristol. One day in 2014 she decided to call in, as she was interested in its ethical credentials. “It’s not a branch or anything but I didn’t understand that at the time. The woman who saw me explained everything and showed me all over the building – all the renewable and eco-friendly stuff they’ve got there. They had a display wall with goods from ethical companies that they support and I thought, this is the place, I’ll look no further.”As a retired nurse, Furneaux feels that more of her life is behind her than ahead of her, but she is concerned about the kind of world being left to her daughters and grandchildren. Investing in causes she cares about, such as renewable energy and organic food, gives her peace of mind that she is playing a part in a fairer, healthier planet.After retiring in 2000, Furneaux travelled the world by motorbike, and then wrote a book about her experiences, using her local library as a place to do research and to work, hence her frequent visits. It was her travels that opened her eyes to some of the world’s injustices.“I have seen so much poverty and inequality,” she says. “I wanted to do my bit I didn’t want to invest in arms, or tobacco, or anything that I really don’t believe in.” Furneaux has invested in the Triodos Pioneer Impact Fund and the Triodos Global Equities Impact Fund, both through a Triodos Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA, and says she may use the money to help her grandchildren one day.Alasdair Macdonald, 72In the early 1990s Glaswegian Alasdair Macdonald and his wife, Kate, decided they’d had enough of the mainstream banking sector. A wrangle over a simple cheque had left them with a bad taste in their mouth and, at the same time, they were keen to use their money to support ethical causes.Macdonald was active with his local branch of Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity, so was already aware of the concept of protecting the planet for future generations. When he heard about Triodos and its ethos, he decided to find out more. “I got some of their documentation and thought it was quite good,” he says. “They seemed to be doing the kinds of things we like.”The couple were nearing retirement at the time, and had some money to invest. They decided to open a savings account, and take out a Stocks \u0026amp Shares ISA with Triodos, which they saw as a positive alternative to mainstream banks.Both Macdonald and his wife have teachers’ pensions, which they were able to retire on. But their Triodos accounts are there as a buffer for when life throws a curveball or when some rainy day money is needed.With all investing, your capital is at risk. The Triodos Impact Investment Funds should be seen as long-term investments (five years or more), as their value can go down as well as up and you may not get back what you put in. It’s important to remember that past performance is not a guide to future returns.The tax benefits of an ISA are subject to change and depend on inidual circumstances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f157d8f978a7db68c6f885c1edb01c5bbfe124c/0_0_3276_1965/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71a6b69b23da62ed923d345da7143f3b","title":"babies being removed from mothers during remote hearings report","story":"Judges express concern about virtual family court hearings being held during pandemicNew mothers are having their babies taken into care during remote video and phone hearings from hospital, according to a report on justice during the coronavirus pandemic.Parents are also joining online proceedings from home – often without adequate technology or support – when life-changing decisions are made about their children, the study commissioned by the president of the family ision of the high court, Sir Andrew McFarlane, reveals.Almost half of parents and relatives involved in virtual family court hearings during the crisis said they did not understand well what was happening, analysis by the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory concluded. Nonetheless, most professionals believed the system was working smoothly while delivering fairness and justice.The report is designed to show a determination to be transparent about how family courts have adapted to remote working even in the most sensitive cases, including child custody and domestic abuse. It records instances of a mother self-harming during hearings, litigants appearing remotely in their pyjamas or while still in bed, and a judge taking a home delivery.Even before the Covid pandemic struck in March, there was a debate about whether remote hearings – which were rare in family courts – delivered justice. Deep cuts to legal aid mean that since 2013, many litigants are no longer represented in family courts. Heavy workloads were made worse by the months-long closure of courts. The report says problems experienced included “parents taking part in hearings remotely alone and from their homes, lack of communication between parties and their legal representatives”, and communication difficulties during hearings.Most parents joined by phone rather than video link. Those who needed an interpreter or who had disabilities faced particularly severe challenges.The most difficult cases were those in which social services believed babies needed to be taken into care under an interim order shortly after birth. They usually involved a mother joining the hearing by a phone from hospital. Previously they were more likely to have been represented by a lawyer in court.“There is nothing fair about a remote hearing which requires you to remove a newborn baby from its mother,” one judge commented. “Remote hearings do not enable you to show empathy.”A barrister told researchers: “I was required to represent a mother who was in hospital having given birth where removal was sought. She had no support, and she took part by phone.”The report says “mothers have frequently not been able to have any physical contact with their babies following their removal” during the pandemic because of fears over infection.One judge expressed significant reservations about remote hearings for such sensitive cases. “Removing children and making major decisions, eg on contact, can have … lifelong consequences. Notwithstanding everyone’s best efforts, remote parties cannot sometimes be adequately engaged … I have real misgivings about how fair it is and how fair it is felt and seen to be.”Another remarked: “I worry about making orders which may be very distressing to a participant, eg the removal of their child. In court, they’d at least have a lawyer with whom they could grieve, rant, consider appeal and have support. By phone or video, they may be in their bedroom, alone and in despair, perhaps with the child and now awaiting a visit from a social worker.”There were more positive reactions, with some lawyers believing geographical separation between feuding parents helped. One barrister observed: “It has been easier to bring parties and advocates together who are geographically distant from each other without the need for extensive travel or exposure to possible Covid-19.”Another said: “The fact that hearings are now subject to a time slot and finish in that time slot is welcome. The days of sitting at court all day waiting to get on for five minutes are, I hope, over.”McFarlane, who has been president of the family ision of the high court since 2018, said: “This emergency is without precedent. Judges and others have worked tirelessly, and continue to do so, so that the family court has continued to function without a break since the start of lockdown … We have adjusted, developed and adapted our methods of working as the crisis has persisted. Much of the work of the family court cannot be left to wait as many cases, involving the welfare of children as well as adults, are urgent.”“However … there are clearly circumstances where more support is required to enable parents and young people to take part in remote hearings effectively. It is worrying that some parents report that they have not fully understood, or felt a part of, the remote court process.“Whilst technology is improving, there is clearly still work to be done to improve the provision of family justice via remote means. I am very alert to the concerns raised in this report, and I will be working with the judiciary and the professions to develop solutions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/131fe216826713a262dbf7e6455c1f9dd82d81fe/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c2cfc40b7a4966a150919fb214263b1e","title":"what are your plans for christmas in the uk coronavirus","story":"We want to hear how you are planning on spending Christmas during the pandemicIt may still be over a month away but with Christmas expected to be different this year and many areas of the country under local restrictions, we want to hear what your plans are for the festive season.How are you planning on spending Christmas with family?

The replacement season it has devised, Lyric Solitude, is both practical and imaginative: three programmes of 20th-century pieces, each with a single singer and piano accompaniment. Strictly speaking, only two of the works included are operas – Poulenc’s La Voix Humaine, and Dominick Argento’s A Water Bird Talk – the rest are song cycles, by Britten, Tippett, Shostakovich and Poulenc, all of them staged, however minimally.The season was unveiled as the latest weekend of music at Snape Maltings, and in the second of those programmes, which was ided into two hour-long sessions, dance, or at least movement, was the added theatrical ingredient. In Tippett’s Boyhood’s End, his cantata setting extracts from the naturalist WH Hudson’s memoir of growing up in Argentina, the dancer Paul Chantry traced abstract movements around tenor Thomas Elwin’s wonderfully lucid singing, while in the other work by Tippett, the song cycle The Heart’s Assurance, Bernadette Iglich provided the movement, unfurling a bedroll (or was it a shroud?) as Elwin delivered the settings of poems by Sidney Keyes and Alun Lewis.Between the two there was Britten’s Holy Sonnets of John Donne, sung by Richard Dowling. Britten’s work also formed the centrepiece of the second session, where it was flanked by Shostakovich’s late Poems of Marina Tsvetaeva and more Britten, A Charm of Lullabies, both with the mezzo Katie Stevenson, as the touching soloist. There was more substance to the choreography here – Iglich again – while ETO’s artistic director James Conway was credited with the staging of A Charm of Lullabies, turning it into a monodrama, with Stevenson dressed as a schoolgirl in pinafore dress and ankle socks, sitting on a mound of flowers to deliver the final songs.The common denominator in all of this was the pianist Ian Tindale, as secure and characterful in the baroque flourishes of Boyhood’s End’s piano writing as in the austere spareness of the Shostakovich cycle or Britten’s more obviously virtuosic accompaniments. I’m not sure the whole sequence adds up to more than the sum of its parts, but it is immaculately presented.• At the Assembly Hall Theatre, Tunbridge Wells, 1 November.

Whichever candidate won there could usually expect to enter the White House. It remains true that no Republican candidate has ever taken the presidency without winning Ohio. In 2016, it more than moved towards Donald Trump – he won there by a clear 8 percentage points with promises to revitalise the state and bring back its vanishing industrial jobs.  This year, those same voters return to the polls amid rising cases of Covid-19, a flatlining economy and scant evidence of returning industry. ’s Oliver Laughland visits the city of Youngstown, where supporters of the president are still loudly confident despite the state now appearing too close to call.

Tech journalist Sarah Frier looks at how it went from a tiny startup to a multibillion-dollar business, and the impact the social media company has had on our livesSarah Frier is a tech reporter based in San Francisco who has watched the meteoric rise of Instagram, from its humble beginnings as a startup with a handful of employees to becoming a $100bn company. She talks to Rachel Humphreys about how the photo-sharing platform has become the most influential app of the past decade.  Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, was 25 when he started his company with his friend, software engineer Mike Krieger. Systrom realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones, and with Instagram the app would also offer filters that people could use to make their photos – and by extension, their lives – look more appealing. In 2012, with just 13 employees, the company was bought by Facebook for $1bn. With the introduction of Instagram Stories, its growth accelerated, but the relationship between the two companies was complicated and Systrom and Krieger eventually left Instagram in 2018. Mark Zuckerberg now controls two of the most important social media networks in our lives.

While the beneficiary continues to own and profit from the investments, they are no longer involved in its day-to-day management.In theory, blind trusts allow people in public office to continue to own investments in companies, while avoiding the accusation that there is a potential conflict of interest.While blind trusts are mostly used by politicians, other people in sensitive positions such as journalists, charity workers and even religious leaders have placed their personal assets into blind trusts. In the US, President Lyndon Johnson was an early adopter of a blind trust, as he did not want to sell the Texas television station he owned before entering the White House. Donald Trump and Theresa May both set up trusts when they became president and prime minister respectively.Because they can abused. While they allow politicians to appear to be making decisions free of the accusation of personal gain, blind trusts let politicians own substantial investments free of any public scrutiny as their contents are private.While an actively managed share portfolio, held in a blind trust over a number of years, would allow the beneficiary to argue no conflict of interest, campaigners say a newly appointed minister who had recently transferred their assets into a blind trust would still be aware of where their money was invested.While the beneficiary and the trustee are required not to discuss the trust’s investments and the former should have no influence over the latter, there is little to stop this happening on an informal basis, and it is not policed in any way.Some politicians will sell anything that could be construed as a conflict of interest – Barack Obama sold all his stocks shortly after becoming a senator.In 1998, a parliamentary report by Lord Neill found the use of blind trusts to be “inconsistent with the principles of openness and accountability“ and recommended that such trusts be “prohibited as a mechanism for funding political parties, party leaders, members of parliament or parliamentary candidates”.No. The ministerial code says it is up to the personal responsibility of each minister to decide whether and what action is needed to avoid a conflict or the perception of a conflict.When Theresa May became prime minister she did set up a blind trust, but had chosen not do so when she was appointed home secretary. David Cameron did not use a blind trust while Tony Blair set one up after becoming prime minister. It later emerged that his wife, Cherie, had directed the trustees to buy two flats in Bristol – the start of what grew into a £27m property empire.The trust is simply dissolved and the assets are returned to the original owner, complete with any gain or loss accrued while the investments were held in the trust. Politicians who create a blind trust for their assets when elected usually will terminate it once they leave office and any conflict of interest questions are eliminated.Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “The truth with this trust is that the only people that are blind to it are the public. The chancellor only set up the trust 18 months ago but the public has no idea where the money is or whether there is a conflict of interest. With public trust in this government plummeting, greater transparency in all their dealings is essential and the chancellor must show a lead.”Sunak registered a blind trust in July 2019 after he had been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. Under a standard blind trust arrangement iniduals can still receive income from their investments but cannot make decisions about how the money is invested.The campaigners and MPs are concerned that Sunak will know where his money was invested before he placed it in the blind trust, and that raises concerns that his decisions as chancellor could be influenced by his personal stakeholdings.The financial transparency campaigners have also called on the chancellor to be categorical on the question of whether any of his wealth is sheltered in offshore tax havens.Abena Oppong-Asare, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “Rishi Sunak needs to be completely transparent with the public about whether any of the funds he invested in a blind trust are held in offshore tax havens. Taxpayers paying their fair share expect nothing less.”Sunak is the only chancellor to have used a blind trust since details of ministers’ interests began to be published in 2009. Seven serving ministers hold a blind trust, compared with 13 in 2015.Richard Murphy, a visiting professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and a self-described “tax justice campaigner”, said: “The problem with this arrangement is that the blindness is for the public. We literally know nothing.”Daniel Beizsley of the financial transparency campaign group Spotlight on Corruption said: “The issue as I see it with Sunak is that unless the trustee was given specific instructions to ersify the portfolio, then Sunak is fully aware of its contents. It’s difficult to see how this could absolve him of conflict of interest claims. Additionally, by placing assets into the blind trust arrangement, the public’s ability to judge potential conflicts is reduced as his ministerial declaration is now empty.”Sunak’s spokesperson refused to comment, but a Treasury source said: “Blind trustsblind management arrangements are longstanding mechanisms for protecting ministers in the handling of their interests. They ensure ministers are not involved in any decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement.“Politicians of all stripes have used blind trustsblind management arrangements to ensure they avoid any conflict of interest, including the last Labour government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58aac266f4d7c125a427ffcf0beba864e0713b7/0_4_4560_2738/master/4560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed7cb09373d8c4d89594d415db8ecc17","title":"cycling how to change your inner tube in seven easy steps","story":"Don’t let a puncture deflate your cycling spirit. Here’s everything you need to fix a tyre like a bike shop proYou’re freewheeling along happily, when suddenly you’re very much aware of the bumpy road beneath your wheels – and your bum. As the sound of rubber dragging on asphalt gets louder, reality hits: you’ve got a flat tyre.Whether punctures happen on the way to work or mid-Strava segment on your Sunday training ride, flats are a frustrating part of life on two wheels. Investing in decent tyres such as the near puncture-proof Schwalbe Marathon Plus, which come with a 5mm-thick puncture guard, can massively limit your risk. But even the toughest treads can’t protect against all of the pesky sharps that might make you spring a leak.The good news: even if you do get a flat, with the right preparation and only a little patience, they’re easy to fix. We enlisted the help of one of Schwalbe’s experts, Tim Ward, to bring you this simple step-by-step guide for a speedy swap. Here’s how to get back on the road – and fast – after a puncture.Step 1: Tool upYou’ll need a set of tyre levers and a pump – track pumps are best for home use, while lightweight portable pumps or a portable CO2 inflator are great for speedy roadside re-inflations. Plus a ner, or 5mm or 6mm hex key if your wheels aren’t quick release.Step 2: Release the beastIf the tyre isn’t already fully deflated, use the valve to release any remaining air. This creates extra wiggle room for removing the inner tube and tyre. With the wheel on the ground and the valve opposite you, use your thumbs to push the sidewalls of the tyre, forcing the bead into the middle of the rim on one side. Then use the heels of your hands to unseat the bead all the way round, forcing all the slack into one place.Step 3: Leverage some advantageInsert a lever between the rim and the tyre on one side of the valve and hook it into a spoke to keep it in place. Top tip: Schwalbe’s levers have a handy clip for this. Insert a second lever on the other side of the valve, followed by a third lever a little farther away, until a section of the tyre pops over the rim. Now use your palms to release one side of the tyre all the way round.Step 4: Take the tubeOnce one side of the tyre is off, you can reach in, grab the inner tube and remove it, freeing the valve section last. Check your tyre carefully for glass or nails, inside and out, and inflate the inner tube to feel for holes. Keeping the tube in the orientation it came off the wheel helps match pin-prick puncture holes with the offending items in the tyre. If you can’t find the culprit and you spring another leak, now might be the time to invest in a new tyre to prevent repeat punctures.Step 5: In with the newHave a quick whizz round and make sure your rim tape fits edge to edge, isn’t damaged or kinked, and that there are no sharp edges and no spoke holes showing. Before you insert the new inner tube, inflate it slightly as the shape will help seat it correctly in the centre of the rim bed. Replace it valve first, tucking the tube under the tyre, avoiding any pinch points. Then deflate the inner tube again. If you’re replacing your tyre too, check for directional arrows as these show which way the tyre is designed to sit on the wheel to ensure optimal cornering and braking traction.Step 6: Get into the grooveNow return the tyre beading back inside the rim, section by section, starting opposite the valve. When the last bit inevitably becomes too taut, go back and squeeze the beading of the tyre together to help it find the deeper grooves inside the rim. Then use the heels of your palms to work the slack round. This should create the clearance you need to ease on the final bit. If you need to use a lever, take special care not to pinch the inner tube.Step 7: Pump it upBefore you grab the pump, go around the tyre and check there’s no inner tube poking out of the side underneath the beading. Do this on both sides. Prior to fitting the rim nut on the valve stem, push the valve up into the tyre a few times to clear the tube in case it’s trapped under the bead. Finally, pop the wheel back on, then inflate the tyre to appropriate riding pressure – not exceeding the max PSI, which is stated on the tyre or rim. Keeping them at the right pressure will help them last longer.To find your flat-less tyre, visit schwalbe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ae31891ddf2cebfbf7fa6ec324c00ca46d98f8/0_0_4186_2512/master/4186.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=11842b94dcf2596419429b3be633f4b1","title":"journey into a black hole part 1 podcast","story":"They are among the most enigmatic phenomena in the universe, confounding physicists and mathematicians.

The coffee is sourced in Guatemala, decaffeinated using the Swiss water process in Canada and roasted in London’s Shadwell to give a bean with notes of caramel, cherry and dark chocolate. “The process doesn’t harm the environment, and in a blind taste fools anybody: my neighbour was drinking it for the past year, thinking it was caffeinated,” says Ayers.Website: thegentlemenbaristasAddress: 63 Union St, London SE1 1SG, and four other locations of its nine sites currently open (see Facebook page for updates)UK, EU and American delivery available, terms and conditions apply.Tideswell tea, £2.85 for 30gDiscovered in Cup \u0026amp Saucer, Chesterfield, DerbyshireMerchant: Gail HannanThe Tideswell tea is one of a range inspired by Lake District towns, created by Gail Hannan. “Tideswell is famous for the lime it produces so this is a black tea, with lime leaves, dried lime peel and pieces,” she says. “It’s refreshing, nice hot or with ice on a summer’s day.” She sources ingredients locally wherever possible, although the black tea comes from China and India and the limes are from the local greengrocer. “I haven’t yet found anyone who grows limes – or pineapple or coconut – in Derbyshire!”Website: cupandsauceronlineAddress: 132 High Street.

But the legacy he leaves behind is complex“Alhamdulillah. God gave me everything.”The Islamic phrase was among the first words spoken by Khabib Nurmagomedov following his submission victory on Saturday over interim lightweight champ Justin Gaethje at UFC 254. The words carried the weight of the last few months of the champion’s life, a period filled with the tragic passing of his father due to the coronavirus and the unyielding weight of expectations. Now, for the first time in his illustrious career, Khabib Nurmagomedov seemed relieved. He knew his time was up.The most dominant champion in UFC history had retired at the top of his game, all without a single blemish to his undefeated mixed martial arts record.Over the course of his now legendary career, Nurmagomedov (29-0) amassed one of the most impressive records in all sports – a record characterized by dominant performances, a suffocating fighting style and a unique charm that made him one of the most fascinating athletes in a generation. Yet despite his unquestionable athletic prowess, Nurmagomedov’s legacy is a complicated one filled with questionable affiliations with authoritarian figures and oligarchs, advocacy for increased cultural censorship and casual misogynism.Born in 1988 to Avar parents, Nurmagomedov grew up Silde, a modest village in the ethnically erse republic of Dagestan. He spent his childhood under the tutelage of his late father, Abdulmanap, a hardened and accomplished wrestler turned coach who dedicated his life to training Dagestan’s disenfranchised youth in the hopes of offering them an alternative path to Islamic extremism.On a September morning in 1997, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov informed his second-born son that he would be put through a test. He approached Khabib – three days removed from his ninth birthday – and led him out towards the edge of the forest, where a bear cub was chained to a nearby tree. Abdulmanap then turned on a handheld camera, pointed it at his son and ordered him to the wrestle the animal. Even at age nine, Khabib was well accustomed to the Dagestani culture and patriarchy, and knew better than to question his father’s wishes.So the young Khabib bent down, tucked his chin into his chest and lunged at the bear.More than two decades after his fateful encounter with the bear cub, Khabib accumulated an undefeated MMA record of 29 consecutive victories, 13 of which took place in the UFC, the sport’s most prominent promotion. His unblemished resume is matched only by his relentless pace and wrestling acumen, which he uses to demoralize his opponents. His uncanny ability to repeat this process on a consistent basis in the UFC’s most competitive ision is why he has earned his place as the pound-for-pound king of the sport and one of the most popular Muslim athletes on the planet, second only to Egypt’s Mohamed Salah.However, beyond his athletic accomplishments and stardom, Nurmagomedov has also made headlines for a list of controversies, including a longstanding affiliation with Chechnya’s dictator, Ramzan Kadyrov – the murderous tyrant known for oppressing his people and pursuing anti-gay purges among Chechnya’s LGBTQ+ community.While Nurmagomedov’s association with Kadyrov may not be entirely reflective of the fighter’s personal politics, he has allowed himself to be co-opted by a dictator who uses his relationships with athletes to rebrand himself as a magnanimous, sports-loving leader and to distract from his human rights abuses.Nurmagomedov has also affiliated with other authoritarian regimes, including the Kingdom of Bahrain through one of the monarchy’s princes, Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad Al Khalifa. In 2015, Nurmagomedov joined KHK MMA, an MMA training facility funded by the prince himself, and represented the organization for the better part of a year.Outside of lending his brand to tyrants and despots, Nurmagomedov also has ties to Ziyavudin Magomedov, a Dagestani oligarch who was arrested in April 2018 on charges of embezzlement and faces a potential 20-year prison sentence. The oligarch was one of Nurmagomedov’s key sponsors, and was responsible for covering training expenses and paying for Nurmagomedov’s back surgery in 2017. Following Magomedov’s arrest in 2018, Nurmagomedov used his UFC post-fight speech to appeal to Russia’s president Vladimir Putin to release him.Following Nurmagomedov’s highly publicized victory against disgraced UFC star Conor McGregor, the UFC champion cemented his place as one of the world’s most popular Muslim athletes, as well as one of the most influential celebrities in Russia. Nurmagomedov subsequently used this influence to further his ultra-conservative worldview, including to campaign against cultural events that took place in his native Dagestan. In 2018, he suggested closing all nightclubs in his native republic and criticized a rap concert that took place in Makhackala, Dagestan, which resulted in rapper Egor Kreed canceling his performances in the conservative republic after being threatened with rape. When Nurmagomedov was asked to share his thoughts on the event cancelation, he stated that losing the event was “no great loss”.In 2019, Nurmagomedov was embroiled in yet another censorship battle when he spoke out against a controversial play called Hunting for Men, which featured a woman seducing a man while dressed in lingerie. The UFC champion criticized the scene as “filth” and demanded that those behind the play be held responsible. Nurmagomedov’s comments stoked outrage within his native republic, gained traction among local politicians and fellow athletes, and caused the play’s producer to receive alleged threats on social media.To top it off, Nurmagomedov has also expressed sexist views regarding women in the UFC.“For females, I have very good advice, be fighters at home,” Nurmagomedov said at a forum in Saudi Arabia. “And one more advice, all the time, finish your husband.”It should be noted that Nurmagomedov is not the only dominant athlete with a complicated legacy. Muhammad Ali – arguably the most beloved athlete of all time – was once the guest of Mobutu Sese Seko, the Zaire dictator who amassed $15bn in personal wealth while his country was facing human rights violations and extreme poverty. Ali stayed at Seko’s mansion ahead of the Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. On fight night, Seko executed 100 criminals and held hundreds more in rooms under the stadium.While Ali’s friendly ties to a vicious dictator did not define his legacy, it is important to understand how some of his most infamous bouts helped prop up authoritarian regimes. The same applies to Nurmagomedov, whose athletic career took place against a backdrop of controversy. This does not change his athletic achievements, but complicates his legacy as one of the great athletes of all time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c781964bc08dbb1f05756e2869c202ff2bf2ab/0_146_4332_2600/master/4332.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7c1adb110705b0cd4e3eda08ab6fa6c6","title":"autumn tour of uk arboretums living library of trees leaves","story":"Planted by specimen collectors in the 18th and 19th centuries, arboretums are a ‘living library of trees’ that have become an invaluable public resource for recreation and educationAutumn’s blaze of glory, all flame-red leaves and burnt-gold foliage, offers an opportunity to marvel at the brilliance of the natural world before hunkering down for winter. Though, as nature goes into hibernation, forests, woods, parks and arboretums can often feel alive with walkers, joggers and families exploring them.The experience of lockdown has changed many people’s relationships with nature and will undoubtedly extend our interaction with the arboreal beyond the traditional leaf-peeping season. Outdoor trends, such as forest bathing, awe-walks and even park strolls, have become a lifeline to many, and now the UK’s most spectacular spaces set aside for trees – arboretums – are seeing record numbers of visitors.“The arboretum being shut for 10 weeks had a huge impact. More people have come than ever, even though we have capped the numbers. In August, we had 10,000 more day visitors than last August,” says Andrew Smith, director of Westonbirt Arboretum, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire.Tony Kirkham, head of arboretum at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, describes arboretums as “a living reference library of trees”. At Kew there are more than 2,500 species from around the world, some of which are nearly 300 years old.“The term arboretum became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it’s slippery,” says Paul Elliott, professor of modern history at the University of Derby. “Arboretum meant tree collection, but it was more than just a group of trees of the same kind: it was a systematic collection that had botanical significance. However, in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, they became a bit of a joke. You’d see people in their small gardens having a few trees and labelling it an arboretum.”There are no strict lower limits on what constitutes an arboretum and many are still in private hands. Elliott estimates there are more than 200 in England and Scotland, recorded on the National Heritage List for England and the Historic Environment Scotland inventory of gardens and designed landscapes (figures are not available for Wales and Northern Ireland). Many, such as at Westonbirt (known as the National Arboretum), started life as private collections by wealthy iniduals.“It was a craze for wealthy people with some land,” says Kirkham. “Lots of these people went for rarity, the new introductions. As they were being discovered, they wanted to be the first to have them in their collections.”The first tree to be planted at Westonbirt was a Scots pine to mark the 21st birthday of Robert Stayner Holford, heir to one of the grandest estates in Britain, and founder of the arboretum in 1829. With serious tree planting beginning around 1852, thousands of trees from Asia and the Americas were planted in this part of Gloucestershire.“If you look at maps of the time, they created an arboretum from nothing,” says Westonbirt archivist Alison Vry.The man responsible for this craze among the upper classes, says Elliott, was John Claudius Loudon, a Scottish writer, landscape designer and “a key early proponent of the idea of arboretums as a public place”. Loudon was a prolific horticultural and landscape design writer, and he communicated many of his ideas through the Gardeners Magazine, which he started in 1826.“He was very interested in transforming the urban environment by ‘greenifying’, or beautifying towns and cities, and bringing parks, gardens and green spaces to the masses,” says Elliott.Following the publication of his eight-volume Arboretum et fruticetum britannicum in 1838, Loudon was given the opportunity to put his “Gardenesque” theories of landscape design in public spaces into practice on land gifted to the people of Derby by textile merchant Joseph Strutt. Derby Arboretum opened in 1840 as what its current manager Mick McNaught describes as the “first purpose-built public park in Britain”.Free to the public for two days a week at first, and with 1,013 species of inidually labelled trees, McNaught says Derby Arboretum “was laid out as a scientific collection. Both Strutt and Loudon were committed to educating the working classes. It was all about trying to give a place of recreation and enjoyment, while at the same time offering an opportunity to improve their minds.”Derby Arboretum was an instant success, and sparked a wave of park openings across increasingly industrialised Britain. Elliott says that as a result, “arboretums were adopted as a model for public parks”.“There was this idea that people would walk around the park and be learning botany and arboriculture, reading the guidebooks and observing how the trees were growing.”McNaught says of Derby Arboretum that “even today, to the people who live around it, it’s their local park, but it’s of national importance”.The connection between public education and recreation was always part of the plan for Derby Arboretum. But even trees planted centuries ago as private collections have since come into the public domain. Princess Augusta’s extensions to Kew Gardens in 1759 are today seen by two million visitors a year. Similarly, Westonbirt opened to the public when management of the park was passed to what is now Forestry England in 1956 .Kirkham explains that “a big role for an arboretum is education, because schools can come in with a teacher and do every part of the national curriculum. Maths by measuring trees, working out circumference and volume. History and geography – the year they were introduced and where from. They are an amazing educational resource.”And it is a resource that’s becoming important in terms of conservation and climate crisis. “Our collection also provides a place to study how a changing climate is affecting a variety of tree species,” says Westonbirt’s Smith. A walk around Derby, Kew, Westonbirt or any of the other UK’s arboretums on an autumn day demonstrates that whatever their histories, they are a much-loved part of the landscape. They also have an important role to play in our future health. “It’s been proven that trees are good for your mental wellbeing,” says Kirkham. “They have shown that sick people get better quicker if they can see trees from their hospital window. An arboretum that people can walk round, looking at seasonal attributes should be highly valued.”He adds: “I think if we can draw people into an arboretum and tell them stories about trees, then trees will get the respect that they deserve”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f2d3cb12fb564ac6eede66003c2c83e08d2242/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1533737020c414b7401b303a2f1f84ef","title":"how we made bbc mockumentary ghostwatch","story":"‘Our producer received a letter from a woman asking for compensation to buy new trousers for her husband, as he had soiled the ones he was wearing’The script focused on the story of two girls, Kim and Suzanne Early (Cherise and Michelle Wesson), and their mother Pam (Brid Brennan), who lived in a reportedly haunted council house in Northolt, London. It was presented as a “live ghost hunt”, with reporters, interviewers and a film crew in the house, and an anchorman in the studio. To quote the screenplay: “Certain parts will be played by real television personalities, using their true names.”I had never read anything as fresh and immediately started researching how to make the story, which was written by Stephen Volk, feel as real as possible. All of the adult cast – Michael Parkinson, Sarah Greene, Mike Smith, Craig Charles, each playing themselves – understood the concept, and were wholeheartedly behind the piece. Raymond “Pipes” Tunstall, the ghost haunting the Early family, was played by Keith Ferrari, a very game supporting artist in a non-speaking part. While he supplied the poltergeist’s physical presence, I ended up providing his guttural voice. We had done a one-hour recording session with a voiceover artist but that hadn’t cracked it.I was trying to feature the Pipes character as much as possible: I seem to remember 13 being a satisfying number of appearances. But, as you can imagine, when it came to the cutting room, counting these wasn’t the focus of our work, and a couple were cut back. I was reaching for hyperrealism in performance, though I’m not saying I always achieved it.It was a leap of faith on my part that Ghostwatch would air on Halloween. We hoped it would, but the production had been commissioned as a Screen One BBC drama film. I wasn’t seen as a documentary or studio director and I certainly didn’t have any control over scheduling, but it happened that there was a Screen One slot available on Halloween. A happy accident, perhaps.Many viewers thought the programme was a real-time documentary, including, apparently, Michael Parkinson’s mother. Hopefully she deduced it was staged before his climactic possession scene. The BBC received 30,000 complaints, and imposed a 10-year ban on it being shown again. I believe our producer received a letter from one woman asking for compensation so she could buy a new pair of trousers for her husband, as he had soiled the ones he was wearing.I definitely didn’t set out to cause mass hysteria. But I wasn’t trying to make it look like a conventional BBC movie, either. I thought the fact that it was a drama was obvious: it was trailed as such by the continuity announcer, and it opened with a “written by” credit.Ghostwatch was using tried-and-tested formats to make us question the “truth” of television. On the front page of the script, Stephen wrote a quote from John Waite about his cousin Terry Waite, the former hostage and a humanitarian, when he heard of his release. “I won’t believe it until I see it on TV.”I can’t remember whether I was allowed to read the script before auditioning: it seemed to be rather hush-hush. But I was excited to be trying out for a female director, female casting director and female producer. A rare thing in 1992.I was blown away by Stephen’s writing and vision. He took me to hear lectures on the paranormal and gave me background reading. As far as I was concerned, I was making a very contemporary drama. It was a Screen One production with a cast list appearing in the Radio Times, so we were unprepared for the reaction Ghostwatch received from people who didn’t realise it was fictional.Michael Parkinson, playing the host presenter, was a true pro. He was very respectful to everyone. He’s a fan of Gershwin and the great American songbook, and I remember us quoting lyrics to each other between takes. I didn’t experience any on-set spookiness. Not even when my character is listening to a recording of the poltergeist’s voice.Ghostwatch got 11 million viewers and came in under budget, but talk of a Bafta nomination was quietly crushed, and I feel sad that the controversy meant that Lesley and producer Ruth Baumgarten’s talents weren’t recognised. Over the years, however, it has garnered cult status. Jonathan Ross, Derren Brown, Mark Gatiss and Andy Nyman are fans, and a couple of years ago I did a Q\u0026ampA where people came dressed as Lin Pascoe, complete with wig and designer suit. Some of them weren’t even born when Ghostwatch aired in 1992.Looking back now, it seems amazingly ahead of its time: pre-Big Brother, and seven years before The Blair Witch Project. Apart from being a brilliant ghost story, what it was really saying was: “Be very careful what you watch, question everything, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.”On Halloween, we all gathered to watch it on BBC One. I got home later to an answerphone message from a comically enraged Judi Dench, complaining that I’d ruined her night. She had sat down to watch Ghostwatch but – having directed me in the theatre that summer – knew as soon as she saw me on screen that it wasn’t real.• Ghostwatch is available on DVD. A National Séance Live Twitter viewing begins on 31 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac69ee7e256133b906816af35e55b3d7f3ea74d/0_115_7441_4465/master/7441.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e9e785403334f65ca72ffe7683915773","title":"do you eat fish seven of the worlds worst chat up lines","story":"Hoping to get a date? Here’s the openers you should steer clear ofA man in a bar once said to me: “I think you’re on fire.” I’m not averse to a chat-up line as long as it’s funny or deployed with sufficient flair – in the age of online dating, a zinging opener is as much a necessity as an appreciation for the absurd.As I waited for the punchline, though, the man from the bar began open-palm slapping me on the back. It turns out, he wasn’t trying to be cute (he had a girlfriend who was watching in horror), it was just that my hair had caught alight on a candle and I was moments away from turning into a full human flame.You live, you learn. Sometimes, a man does just want to know if you’re tired, not because you’ve been running through his mind all day, but because you’re looking a bit wan.And sometimes you really are on fire.Here are some of the worst actual* pick-up lines I’ve heard, which, given that I’ve been single for, literally, ever, may possibly be the worst in the world.‘Pull your knees to your chest and relax’Nothing that sounds like an instruction from a gynaecologist will ever secure a date. See also: “I’m regularly screened for STIs”, which a GP once said to me on a dating app and which, tbf, in these difficult dating times, could be read as quite thoughtful, really.‘Would you restrain me in latex?’I did end up going on a date with this one because I thought it was a joke and played along, like “ha ha, sure”. In reality, he was a latex fetishist who turned up to our Thursday night drinks in Old Street with a gimp suit in his bag. I couldn’t tell who was more disappointed I thought I’d found someone with a good sense of humour, he thought he’d found a new mistress. I bought him an apology drink and said it wasn’t really my thing.It did make me wonder, though, perhaps we need clearer guidelines on when it’s appropriate to initiate a potential partner into your kinks and fetishes.My friends said that my tolerance for weirdness had obviously grown too high if I was responding to this.‘I think I saw you in Fitness First.’No one likes to be stalked, especially while blobbing around on a treadmill at 7am.‘I have a lot of money.’A few years ago, my friend and I had bumped into a guy we knew from university in a bar in Ibiza and ended up going back to his yacht (it was his parents’ yacht) for a “party”.They also invited a Russian model and a 22-year-old shot girl from Newcastle who was out there doing a season. The “party” turned out to be bad electronic dance music played from a phone in a pint glass and everyone speaking in hushed tones so as not to wake the boat’s skipper who’d have to get up and sail in a few hours.Perhaps out of boredom, the Russian model took off all her clothes and jumped in the sea. Then the six men who were actually staying on the boat all had a hissed debate about whose responsibility it was to go in after her. After it was decided that it wouldn’t be him, one of them sat next to me with a self-satisfied smile and whispered: “I have a lot of money”, and, honestly, I’m not sure what else I expected. (NB: the model was fine and enjoyed her swim).‘Do you eat fish?’Yes, I do eat fish. But this one came hot on the heels of the latex fetishist so, taking my friends’ advice, I did not reply.‘Do you want a swig of this gin?’… said a man as I waited for a taxi to take me home after a party. It was 3:45am and he was gulping from a bottle. At least it was a nice gin, I thought. I also thought he probably had a drinking problem, so that was that.‘Suck it.’So I’m never going to eat an ice lolly in public again.*I genuinely wish some of these were exaggerated, but they’re not.So why not try more than hi?

It followed last week’s approval of a $1.8bn weapons package sale, including missiles, rocket artillery, aerial reconnaissance sensors, and an August sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets.Lockheed Martin said foreign arms sales were “government-to-government transactions” and all of its international sales were “strictly regulated by the US government”. It said its China presence was limited.A spokesman for Boeing said the company remained committed to its partnership with China’s aviation community.Zhao called on the US to stop selling weapons to Taiwan or having military ties with it.“The US arms sales to Taiwan severely violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns it,” he said.“We will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests.”The three China-US communiques were signed when the US cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan to recognise the People’s Republic of China more than four decades ago. The US does not formally recognise Beijing’s claim over Taiwan, and recently declassified Reagan-era cables detailed security assurances given at the same time, committing to continued arms sales with Taiwan without Beijing consultation.US relations with Taiwan have grown as they have soured with Beijing. This year the US has sent two government delegations to Taiwan, prompting Chinese threats of countermeasures. Washington adjusted its one-China policy in response to “the increasing threat posed by Beijing to peace and stability in the region” and its targeting of Taiwan.Taiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed the defence sales and said: “In the face of China’s military expansion and provocations, Taiwan will continue to strengthen the modernisation of its defensive capabilities and accelerate the improvement of its asymmetrical capabilities in order to maintain regional peace and stability.”Taiwan is building up its defence capabilities to discourage any possible cross-strait conflict. It has spent more than $1bn this year in scrambling jets to respond to increased Chinese military drills and sorties over the so-called “median line” in the Taiwan Strait.Dr Ou Si-fu, vice president of the Taiwanese defence think tank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said Taiwan won’t receive the defence materials for years, and the military needed time to train its personnel and in some cases build the infrastructure to house the assets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7fff03fd7547f8490e19bb19a794edb03807a1/0_274_8256_4957/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0296cd7b78cd37c04d031237015997cd","title":"covid vaccine uk oxford university astrazeneca works in all ages trials suggest","story":"Vaccine being trialled by Oxford University and AstraZeneca offers hope for all age groupsOne of the world’s leading Covid-19 experimental vaccines produces an immune response in older adults as well as the young, its developers say, raising hopes of protection for those most vulnerable to the coronavirus that has caused social and economic chaos around the world.Neither Oxford University nor its commercial partner AstraZeneca would release the data from the early trials showing the positive effects, which are being submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. But AstraZeneca confirmed the basic findings about the vaccine it calls AZD1222, which were shared at a closed academic meeting.The phase 2 trials have shown that people over the age of 56 – and some over 70 – produced the same sort of antibody response as younger volunteers. Whether older people would be protected has always been a key question for the vaccines being developed. The body’s natural immune system and therefore its ability to fight any virus weakens with age, which is why the Covid death rate rises in older people.The data also show that fewer side-effects – referred to by the scientists as “reactogenicity” – were reported in the older volunteers, which is encouraging, although it could mean that fewer of them reported issues such as a sore arm.“It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the Covid-19 disease severity is higher. The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,” said an AstraZeneca spokesman.A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people. However, few think the first vaccines will be fully protective. They may instead reduce the severity of illness, so that people avoid hospital and deaths are reduced. They may also not last, so that boosters will be needed.AstraZeneca said it hoped the vaccine may be ready for limited use within the coming months. “We anticipate efficacy read-outs from phase 23 trials between now and the end of the year, and if approved within countries, doses of the potential vaccine could be available for use before the end of the year,” said the spokesperson.However, most experts outside the company, and the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, expect it not to be available until 2021. Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year, Hancock told the BBC: “I don’t rule that out but that is not my central expectation.”Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible rollout, mostly in the first half of 2021. AstraZeneca has committed to mass manufacturing and has a capacity of 3bn doses – which equates to enough for 1.5 billion people globally getting the two-dose vaccine. It has also signed deals with manufacturers in other countries, such as India.The final trials (phase 3), looking to see a significant difference in the numbers of deaths between those vaccinated and those who are not, are taking place in six countries. Trials in the US, which were paused after a volunteer in the UK became ill, have resumed. The other countries participating are South Africa, Brazil, Japan and India.The vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with one from Pfizer and BioNTech.Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral-vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, cautioned that no conclusions about the efficacy of the vaccine should be drawn until the data had been published.“In order to comment properly on this we need to see the data,” he said. “It is encouraging that the investigators suggest that the immune responses measured in the blood seem to show efficacy both above, as well as below, age 70. The later phase trials are needed to see if the immune responses translate into clinical efficacy in preventing infection. These will involve much larger numbers and it is wise to not be too optimistic until those trials have completed.”Raised antibody levels in the blood indicated but did not guarantee protection from the virus multiplying in the body, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e465526e14137bf60c96fcac64b592e5bf09888/0_0_4666_2801/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea763f2f091603eae91c9bc20eefcaab","title":"global survey shows widespread disapproval of covid response","story":"People in most of 25 countries think governments failed to act well or quicklyPeople in most of 25 countries around the world think governments and leaders failed to respond either well or fast enough to the coronavirus crisis, a new global survey shows.YouGov’s globalism survey of about 26,000 people in countries from Australia to Sweden, designed with the  and carried out by the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project between July and August, before the second wave hit in Europe and elsewhere, showed striking variations in approval for governments’ handling of the pandemic, which has killed nearly 1.1 million people.A record four in five respondents in Denmark, which locked down very early in March as the first wave hit and has managed to limit Covid deaths to 119 per million inhabitants, thought their government had done very or fairly well.Observers suggest this may reflect dissatisfaction with the government’s early response (many felt it was reluctant to take action as long as the summer Olympics were still theoretically possible), combined with a popular belief that Japan’s success in avoiding mass infections and a high death rate may be due more to the good sense and compliance of ordinary people than to government directives.The Japanese government’s record low approval rating does not, at any rate, appear to reflect what Christian Drosten, the chief virologist of Berlin’s Charité hospital and one of Germany’s leading experts on the pandemic, has called the “prevention paradox”: if your strategy works, people tend to think it was probably unnecessary.The majority of those surveyed thought the Chinese government was too slow to act, and citizens of 16 of the 25 countries – including Spain, Britain, France, Brazil, Sweden, Italy, Australia, the US and Japan – thought the spread of virus in their countries could have been prevented if their own government had responded differently.The survey found generally strong support for wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces such as shops, airports, on public transport and in medical facilities – one of the more contentious measures imposed or strongly advised by many governments as the pandemic has progressed.Respondents in Sweden, where masks are still not advised by the national health agency (“We prefer half-empty buses than full buses with face masks,” Tegnell has said), and Denmark, where masks are mandatory only on public transport, when standing in bars and restaurants and in healthcare situations, were the most doubtful.By contrast, people in countries where the pandemic hit hard during the first wave and where masks are already obligatory in many settings were much more likely to say the use of face masks in public places was very or fairly effective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159f5fec8821ff5bcb7fd953552463efc1079842/0_212_5450_3272/master/5450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae630f4281b75d0b9571f454cc7a7ee","title":"hong kong activist detained while attempting to seek asylum at us consulate","story":"Tony Chung, 19, was on bail on suspected national security offences when he was reportedly ‘snatched away’Tony Chung, a 19-year-old Hong Kong activist on bail after his arrest on suspected national security offences, has been detained by authorities while attempting to seek asylum at the US consulate.Two other members of Chung’s now-disbanded activism group, Yanni Ho and William Chan, were also arrested later on Tuesday.According to the UK-based group Friends of Hong Kong, Chung had gone to the US consulate in Hong Kong at 8.10am on Tuesday but it was closed for another 20 minutes. He called the organisation from a coffee shop less than 50 metres from the consulate, and said he had been followed by a man in a green shirt who he feared was a national security agent.Local media, citing police sources, said he was being held at a central station. The South China Morning Post reported it witnessed Chung being led away from the coffee shop, flanked by two men.Hours later, the Facebook page for Studentlocalism, a pro-independence group of which Chung was formerly the convenor, said Ho and Chan had also been arrested and taken to police stations.Hong Kong police confirmed the arrests late on Tuesday, saying two men and one woman aged between 17 and 21 had been detained for investigation on suspicion of publishing content inciting independence, in violation of the national security law.On the eve of the national security law’s introduction, Studentlocalism announced the group was disbanding, before moving its base offshore. Its Facebook page has continued to post updates.In July, Chung, Chan and Ho were among four student activists arrested under the Beijing-imposed national security law, for allegedly advocating online for an independent Hong Kong. Chung’s passport was confiscated and he was released on bail.The Friends of Hong Kong spokesman said Chung had been told to report on Monday to police on Tuesday. He feared he would face further charges and have his bail revoked, prompting him to seek asylum at the US consulate.The US does not grant asylum to people at its diplomatic postings – asylum seekers must be physically present on US soil. However, there are more complicated processes to apply for refugee status, of which the Hong Kong consulate is a processing post, according to state department websites.The spokesman said they had previously petitioned the US state department on behalf of Chung, but after the activist was told to report to the police station he decided he could not wait for a response.“He feared for his life and asked if he could enter the US consulate to seek asylum,” he said.The national security law was imposed on the previously autonomous region in late June, bypassing Hong Kong’s legislature but with the blessing of its government. The law criminalises acts of subversion, secession, foreign collusion and terrorism, and has been criticised as so broadly defined as to infringe upon basic human rights of free speech and assembly, and breach international law.At least 27 people so far have been arrested under the law, amid a Hong Kong-wide crackdown on dissent, the pro-democracy movement and people advocating for independence.Chung is also awaiting trial over another case where he stands accused of desecrating the national flag. Last month, he told the  he was unable to travel or enrol in studies while he waited for both cases to be resolved.“Being in prison is surely not as dreadful as the wait,” he said. “I am awaiting my fate like a prisoner.

And we don’t know what is going to happen next.”The US consulate has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81673619b9e30ca09d499bb0117c76e59fff1492/890_577_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1e8e04722cdceb17105a1dfba3625a17","title":"structural racism led to worse covid impact on bame groups report","story":"Minority ethnic people in UK were ‘overexposed, under protected, stigmatised and overlooked’, review findsStructural racism led to the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, a review by Doreen Lawrence has concluded.The report, commissioned by Labour, contradicts the government’s adviser on ethnicity, Dr Raghib Ali, who last week dismissed claims that inequalities within government, health, employment and the education system help to explain why Covid-19 killed disproportionately more people from minority ethnic communities.Lady Lawrence’s review found BAME people are over-represented in public-facing industries where they cannot work from home, are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and have been put at risk by the government’s alleged failure to facilitate Covid-secure workplaces.She demanded that the government set out an urgent winter plan to tackle the disproportionate impact of Covid on BAME people and ensure comprehensive ethnicity data is collected across the NHS and social care.The report, entitled An Avoidable Crisis, also criticises politicians for demonising minorities, such as when Donald Trump used the phrase “the Chinese virus”.Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, was commissioned to lead the review by the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, after it became clear minority ethnic people were being disproportionately hit by the pandemic. More than a third of all critically ill Covid-19 patients up to August were from an ethnic minority, according to government statistics.In the report’s foreword, Lawrence, a Labour peer, said minority ethnic people had been “overexposed, under protected, stigmatised and overlooked”. “This has been generations in the making. The impact of Covid is not random, but foreseeable and inevitable – the consequence of decades of structural injustice, inequality and discrimination that blights our society. We are in the middle of an avoidable crisis. And this report is a rallying cry to break that clear and tragic pattern,” she said.The report comes days after Ali suggested it was time to stop using ethnicity when deciding who needed help. “The problem with focusing on ethnicity as a risk factor is that it misses the very large number of non-ethnic minority groups, so whites basically, who also live in deprived areas and overcrowded housing and with high risk occupations,” he said.The equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, said the increased risk appeared to be because of “a range of socio-economic and geographical factors” but warned the risks “remained unexplained for some groups” and further analysis was planned for the coming months.In today’s 26-page report, Lawrence has made 20 immediate and long-term recommendations to protect those most at risk from the virus and reduce societal inequalities.As part of an urgent plan for the winter, the government should remind employers they have a legal duty to record Covid-19 deaths caused by occupational exposure, the report said.Employers should be legally required to publish their Covid-19 risk assessments on a central government portal and must provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), Lawrence concluded.Ministers must also suspend the “no recourse to public funds” rule, Lawrence said, which prevents some migrants accessing state assistance, and give support to any person struggling to self-isolate at home.In the longer term, the government should remove barriers to accessing health services and information, collect comprehensive data on ethnicity and reform the immigration system, the review said.In June, Public Health England’s report on Covid-19 deaths confirmed the risk of dying among those diagnosed with Covid-19 was higher in those in BAME groups than in white ethnic groups.After accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, it found that people of Bangladeshi ethnicity were at most risk, with about twice the risk of death compared with people of white British ethnicity.The review called for a plan to tackle a rise in hate crime and stigmatisation of minority ethnic communities, particularly among politicians.It criticised a tweet from the Conservative MP Craig Whittaker, who wrote in July: “If you look at the areas where we’ve seen rises and cases, the vast majority, but not by any stretch of the imagination all areas, it is the BAME communities that are not taking this seriously enough.”Starmer said the report must be a “turning point”, promising that the next Labour government will implement a race equality act to tackle structural racial inequality.“Government ministers should absorb this report and act immediately. Failure to do so will leave many of our fellow citizens badly exposed over the winter,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “The current evidence shows that a range of factors result in different groups being at an increased risk of infection and death from Covid-19 – from exposure in the workplace to pre-existing health conditions.“For this reason we must be careful to identify the root causes of the disparities we’re seeing and not assume they are evidence of discrimination or unfair treatment in public services like the NHS. Indeed, many of the factors identified in the report affect non-ethnic groups as well.“We will continue taking this work forward to ensure that we do everything we can to protect those most at risk”• This article was amended on 27 October 2020 to clarify that as a peer Doreen Lawrence goes by the honorific Lady Lawrence, not “Dame Doreen Lawrence”, as an earlier version had it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81cab4c54796e73448fad167232ea524bddd825e/0_278_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=057335e56076fef151ff903c206919c9","title":"us evangelical group takes legal action against uk venues","story":"Action comes after appearances by Franklin Graham were cancelled amid protests from LGBT rights campaignersA conservative US evangelical organisation is taking legal action against UK entertainment venues that cancelled appearances by Franklin Graham, a preacher who has expressed homophobic and Islamophobic views, earlier this year.The court cases have been highlighted by openDemocracy as part of an investigation that uncovered evidence of millions of dollars spent by the BGEA and other organisations on the US Christian right since 2007 to further their agenda in Europe and elsewhere in the world.According to openDemocracy, the BGEA spent $20m (£15m) in Europe between 2007 and 2014, the last year for which the organisation’s filings were available.It says that 28 Christian right organisations it investigated have spent at least $270m worldwide, often on legal interventions to support the restriction of rights, including on abortion, LGBT rights and adoption by same-sex couples.At least $88m has been spent in Europe, more than anywhere else outside the US. For example, court briefs have been drawn up in support of the Polish government’s abortion restrictions, including a landmark ruling last week outlawing abortion in the case of foetal abnormality.Franklin Graham – son of the evangelist Billy Graham, president of the BGEA and a staunch ally of Donald Trump – had planned an eight-city tour of the UK in May and June this year. But after protests from LGBT-rights campaigners the venues cancelled his bookings, saying statements Graham had made were incompatible with their values.According to public court records, the BGEA is a claimant in two cases, one concerning venues in Manchester and Birmingham, and the other relating to venues in Sheffield and Wales (Graham had been booked to appear in Newport).In March, following the cancellations, Graham said: “As Americans, we should be concerned about the rise of secularism and the potential suppression of religious freedom and freedom of speech in the UK.”The 67-year-old preacher has said that gay people are “the enemy” and responsible for a “moral implosion”, and that Islam is “an evil and very wicked religion”.In a letter to supporters last week, ahead of the US election, Graham said: “Religious liberty, freedom of speech, the definition of family and gender, and the protection of the unborn are up for grabs with this election cycle. These are key moral issues that are directed by God Himself and are not up to the court of human opinion. Let’s take a stand for God’s truth and vote according to the scriptures.”Peter Tatchell, the LGBT rights campaigner, told openDemocracy: “US evangelicals, funded by secret donors, are exporting homophobia around the world … When they say they are defending religious freedom, what they are really defending is the right of religious people to discriminate against LGBTs.”According to openDemocracy, another Christian right organisation, the Alliance Defending Freedom, has intervened in at least half a dozen cases at European courts. They include a case involving the Christian owners of a Belfast bakery who refused to make a cake promoting same-sex marriage, citing religious beliefs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf45832e717d217e72cbd0c1f58e88f1c042d5b/0_134_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb12371cb3629059cc320aace35467e","title":"very nice kazakhstan adopts borats catchphrase in new tourism campaign sacha baron cohen","story":"An official said the phrase, popularised by Sacha Baron Cohen’s character, sums up the vast tourism potential of the nation in a ‘short, memorable way’Kazakhstan, the home country of the fictional Borat Sagdiyev, has adopted the brash, moustachioed character’s catchphrase – “Very nice!” – for a new tourism campaign.In the recently released Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, the fictional journalist depicts his homeland as misogynistic, homophobic and anti-Semitic –as he does in the original, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. In the first iteration Borat, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, worried that he would be executed if the film wasn’t a success.The first film’s version of the Kazakhstan national anthem begins with the words: “Kazakhstan greatest country in the world, all other countries run by little girls.” (The true anthem begins: “Sky of golden sun, steppe of golden seed”.)Despite these less-than-flattering depictions, Kairat Sadvakassov, the deputy chairman of Kazakh Tourism, said in a statement to the Huffington Post that adopting Borat’s catchphrase in the campaign “offers the perfect description of Kazakhstan’s vast tourism potential in a short, memorable way.”“Kazakhstan’s nature is very nice its food is very nice and its people, despite Borat’s jokes to the contrary, are some of the nicest in the world. We would like everyone to come experience Kazakhstan for themselves by visiting our country in 2021 and beyond, so that they can see that Borat’s homeland is nicer than they may have heard,” he said.The ads show tourists hiking with a selfie stick, (“Very nice!”), drinking fermented horse milk (“Mm, that’s actually very nice!”), marvelling at the architecture (“Wow, very nice!”) and posing for a photograph with Kazakhs in traditional dress (“That’s very nice!”).The idea for the campaign came from American Dennis Keen, who travelled to the country on a high school exchange, then studied with a Kazakh professor at Stanford University. He now lives in Almaty, where he gives walking tours, the New York Times reported.With a lot of time on his hands due to the coronavirus pandemic, he and a friend pitched the idea to the Kazakh tourism board and “immediately” got the go-ahead to make four 12-second ads.The response is a far cry from the nation’s reaction to the original Borat film. After its release in 2006, the Kazakh government placed ads in US newspapers disputing some of the film’s claims and presenting the country as modern, stable and outward-looking. The advertisements were timed with a visit from President Nursultan Nazabayev and featured a photograph of Nazabayev shaking hands with US president George W Bush.Later that year Nazabayev laughed when asked about the film while on a visit to the UK. “The very fact that you have put that question – you will want to learn more and come to Kazakhstan to see for yourself,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"what s it all about online learning terms explained","story":"The arrival of coronavirus to these shores prompted a swift pivot away from the traditional face-to-face style of teaching most students were familiar with since the first day they attended primary school.Students nearing the end of their time in college had their finals to look forward to while others had essays, assignments and end-of-year exams to contend with. That all changed with the lockdown.“The move to emergency remote teaching, learning and assessment was a huge challenge, but one which all academic staff engaged in overnight. The response by both the staff and students, to such a dramatic transition to remote online space, was phenomenal,” says Dr Mary Fitzpatrick, head of the Centre for Teaching and Learning at University of Limerick (UL).As colleges began moving their programmes online for the final semester, educational priorities quickly changed. Gone, all of a sudden, were the classes, lectures, tutorials, trips to the library and group-work meetings.In came video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.The shift to online does have its benefits.“Some of the benefits of course delivery online include flexibility: students can work at their own pace, supporting independent and self-directed learning, and allowing them to fit learning around the rest of their lives and unlimited access to practice and revision resources,” says Dr Alison Hood, dean of teaching and learning at Maynooth University.Many will be unfamiliar with some of the terms associated with distance learning, blended learning and remote learning but this is likely to change in the coming months and years as these learning strategies grow in popularity. Many of these concepts are interrelated – and they all involve learning – but what do they mean inidually and how do they relate to each other?Distance learningA 1960s Australian children’s television series might not be the first thing that springs to mind when we consider the merits of distance learning. Yet for many, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo is where they first came across the practice.The series told the story of a young boy called Sonny and his adventures with his pet kangaroo friend Skippy. Sonny lived in a remote national park and had to use a two-way radio to connect with his teachers in order to receive his education. Thanks to the development of internet technology, distance learning has advanced quite a bit since then. The tools and methods traditionally associated with it such as correspondence courses, educational television and, in the case of Sonny, two-way radios, have now largely been replaced by online learning platforms. In many cases, the interactive online learning environment used to deliver distance learning courses is now the very same platform used by students who attend the face-to-face courses traditionally associated with third-level education.Colleges and universities have improved their ability to deliver distance learning programmes while at the same time offering comprehensive support for students. In short, distance learning is when students don’t attend classroom lessons in person. Instead, they receive instruction, and learn and study from home.Classes are usually conducted over the internet and students can submit assignments remotely. As distance learning offers students the flexibility and convenience of not having to be physically present in the learning institution, the advantages are numerous. Students can access class resources from a single location, they can save substantially on transport and fees as courses offered through distance learning are usually significantly cheaper than traditional classroom-based pedagogy.Blended or hybrid learning This is where the traditional form of face-to-face learning converges with the newer methods of remote and online instruction. Blended learning uses technology to improve the learning process and is the model most likely to be adopted by third-level institutions as ongoing social distancing requirements limit the possibility of traditional in-person lectures taking place in the medium term.Blended learning is customisable and, as a result, a wide range of approaches to the method means the balance between in-class teaching and the use of technology varies from programme to programme. Advocates say it offers the best of both worlds. The curriculum is usually delivered through a combination of classroom-based lectures, online lectures and the use of other online resources. Ideally, these course components complement each other to strengthen the overall outcome.Blended learning also offers students the benefits of in-class engagement with instructors with the flexibility of online learning. The degree to which the course is blended depends on the course programme and the institution in question. Most Irish colleges and universities offer a suite of blended learning courses across undergraduate, graduate and professional level categories. This is likely to continue even when social distancing measures are in place.eLearning Short for electronic learning, eLearning is a term that essentially means learning with the aid of digital tools. It has its roots in distance learning. The internet has contributed greatly to a marked growth in the use of technology for the delivery of education over the past decade and has helped the development of new models of teaching, improved instruction methods and the possibility of better student outcomes.Technology is at the centre of eLearning and without it the programme could not be delivered. Students use computer and internet technology to access the curriculum from outside the traditional classroom.It is widely seen as a flexible and efficient way of delivering the curriculum as most people with a stable internet connection can access these tools and participate in some form of online learning.It is also efficient. Students no longer have to worry about attending a lecture or class at a set time, they can review lecture videos as often as they like, there is no commute time and it can help develop time-management skills. Unsurprisingly, it is often the preferred option for students who are working or who have other constraints on their time.This form of learning is also used in a wider context. In recent years we have seen a sharp growth in demand for online digital courses. Courses called Moocs (Massive Open Online Courses) first appeared in the late 2000s and were seen as a disruptor which would widen access and lower the costs associated with traditional modes of learning.Critics sometimes cite poor student engagement as one of the greatest drawbacks of eLearning. In traditional classroom settings, students can raise their hand and engage in face-to-face interaction with their instructor but it is not as easy to raise the hand digitally in an eLearning environment.The very nature of the approach means students will invariably spend a lot of time on their own in front of the computer screen and the lack of social interaction can lead to a sense of isolation.Tools do exist to facilitate better communication however and the development of video software now means students can interact directly with instructors through video-link. Depending on the type of course undertaken, practical assessments can be difficult to cater for well.Emergency remote teachingNot to be confused with distance learning or online learning, emergency remote teaching is a measure that is adopted in response to a crisis where the curriculum has to be rapidly moved to a virtual online setting.The unintended consequences of emergency remote teaching can include a failure to meet the expectations that students had at the outset of the course. Simply broadcasting a lecture with the aid of a video conferencing tool or uploading a presentation to a virtual learning environment is not the same as presenting course content that has been planned, developed and designed for delivery via a framework that best enables learning to take place.The sudden change in delivery model can mean a change to how course material is absorbed by students and it can also mean a change to the assessment model which can be disruptive for those students who had prepared for another format entirely over a lengthy period of time.The needs of all students might not be met by sudden change, and unexpected barriers such as the digital ide and other inequities can arise. There is also the danger that in the absence of a coherent emergency plan that teaching objectives can shift from the achievement of pre-defined learning goals to enacting a crisis management approach instead.While the process of moving from an established teaching method to an unfamiliar new platform can be difficult, emergency remote teaching can be a useful learning experience as instructors quickly learn to apply what works and discard what doesn’t.Synchronous learningSynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at the same time but not in the same place. Synchronous learning usually involves the use of online tools such as chat and videoconferencing where students and teachers can interact in real-time during class. Class activities typically take place through the use of dedicated virtual learning environments (also known as learning management systems) such as Brightspace, Moodle or Canvas.Asynchronous learningAsynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning often utilises elements such as email, pre-recorded video and other tools such as online discussion forums that facilitate the sharing of information.Learning management systemSometimes referred to as virtual learning environment or virtual learning platforms, learning management systems are web-based software platforms which facilitate the delivery of course content. Platforms provide teaching tools and supports but also allow course instructors to track student performance over time.Multiple formats such as video, audio and text are catered for and students can be assessed through tools such as online quizzes and questionnaires.They are in widespread use at third level and can be used to deliver asynchronous or synchronous-based courses. Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Virtual classroomA virtual classroom is an online learning environment where students interact in real time with the instructor and with each other. Usually delivered via videoconferencing tools, virtual classrooms are also a feature of learning management systems. Students can also usually interact and ask or answer questions by using a chat window. Presentation tools such as PowerPoint or whiteboard tools can usually be utilised by the teacher during class. It is also possible during a class or lecture to operate break-out rooms where students can work together or where the instructor can interact directly with an inidual student.WebinarA webinar is a class in which participants view the same screen at the same time. Very useful in a classroom setting, the instructor controls proceedings and participants can communicate through the use of interactive features such as chatrooms, polls and quizzes.Collaborative toolsThis is usually a reference to materials such as PDFs, slideshow, spreadsheets, presentations, images or text documents. These tools are usually found as a feature within the learning management systems.Flipped classesA feature of some blended learning approaches where lectures are replaced by classes or tutorial-type settings. Students consume content – perhaps by viewing a lecture video or completing an assignment – at home before engaging in analysis and discussion in the live class setting. The practice results in more face-to-face time and affords the instructor greater flexibility in being able to engage directly with students during class, and it can help increase student engagement as they are required to prepare material ahead of the class."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Legislation will require financial advisers to ask for environmental and social preferencesF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland has \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo about siting and scale of proposed development\u0026lsquoWhat often gets overlooked is positive and tangible change occurring at farm level\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Co Kerry is notable for exotic species escaped into the wild from \u0026lsquobig house gardens\u0026rsquoThe Hidden Lakes of Connemara offers \u0026lsquoa tribute to a fascinating landscape\u0026rsquoYoung author and his family live as \u0026lsquoclose as otters\u0026rsquo at the foot of the Mourne MountainsMichael Viney: Mola mola, with its appetite for jellyfish, are in warmer Irish watersClimate change has \u0026lsquogreatly enabled\u0026rsquo a national surge in the range of deerMichael Viney: Despite the threat of disease, Ireland\u0026rsquos living elms can still surpriseMichael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGettyIreland has moved to a second national lockdown under a so-called “soft” Level 5 restrictions strategy for six weeks from Thursday October 22nd until December 1st . It is far from soft, but what exactly does it mean for everyday life?Can I travel outside my county?Yes as long as it\u0027s within 5km of your home. Under Level 5 you will be asked to stay at home, with the exception that you can exercise within 5km of your home.There will be a penalty for movement outside 5km of home, with exemptions to this for essential work and essential purposes.What are deemed essential purposes for travel outside the 5km limit?Shopping for essential items, travelling to and from work where work involves providing an essential service, attending medical appointments and collecting medicines and other health products, farming purposes and to take school-aged children to permitted training.It also includes vital family reasons such as a wedding or funeral, visiting a grave and providing care to children, elderly or vulnerable people and those who live alone as part of an extended household, known as a support bubble.More details on sports below.Can I have any visitors to my home?No. There are to be no visitors to your home or garden.As mentioned, there is the concept of an extended household, known as a support bubble, for defined categories of iniduals to support those at risk of social isolation andor mental ill-health. It will be possible for those in such circumstances to nominate one other household with whom they can mix.Could I meet up with family or a friend away from my home, in a park?It is possible to meet with one other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for exercise.Large social or family gatherings shouldn’t take place in other settings, except for weddings or funerals.So weddings aren’t cancelled?Weddings can still go ahead, with up to 25 guests allowed to attend a wedding ceremony and reception.Are organised indoor or outdoor gatherings allowed to take place such as conferences, events in theatres or other arts events?No organised indoor or outdoor events can take place under Level 5. Museums, galleries and other cultural attractions all remain closed.Parks and outdoor playgrounds can remain open with protective measures in place.Will schools close?The Government’s plan says recommendations for schools, crèches, higher and adult education under Level 5 will be based on the “situation and evidence at time”.The Government has said that schools and crèches will remain open over the next six weeks “in line with current Nphet advice”.Is all sport cancelled?Under the Level 5 plan, inidual training only can take place. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools close.No adult training or matches should take place, with the exception of professional, elite sports and inter-county Gaelic games, horse-racing and greyhound racing, which are being permitted to continue behind closed doors.In addition, in recognition of the impact of restrictions on children and young people, non-contact training can continue for school-aged children, outdoors in pods of 15.What happens to pubs and restaurants?Bars, cafés, restaurants and wet pubs can only offer takeaway or delivery. Nightclubs, discos and casinos will remain closed. Wet pubs in Dublin also remain closed.Are retail outlets, hairdressersbarbers allowed to stay open?Essential retail is only allowed to stay open and face coverings must continue to be worn. Some of the essential retail outlets permitted to remain open includes businesses selling foods and beverages on a takeaway basis, newspaper sales, supermarkets and pharmacies and chemists.Outlets selling products necessary for the essential upkeep and functioning of places of residence and businesses are also allowed to remain open, as well as businesses selling health, medical or orthopaedic goods.Fuel service stations and heating fuel providers, businesses selling items for the health and welfare of animals, laundries and drycleaners, banks post offices and credit unions can also remain open.Outlets selling safety supplies , hardware outlets, businesses providing repair and maintenance of mechanically propelled vehicles or bicycles can also remain open.Optician and optometrists, hearing services, businesses selling office products and outlets selling electrical and communications technology are permitted to remain open on an emergency basis.All other retail and personal services close.What about religious services and funerals?Religious services will be held online while places of worship remain open for private prayer. Up to 25 mourners can attend a funeral.Can hotels and similar accommodation stay open?They are open only for those with “essential non-social and non-tourist purposes”.Do over-70s and medically vulnerable people have to cocoon?Those aged over 70 years and over and the medically vulnerable should exercise judgement regarding the extent to which they engage with others and in activities outside home.It is recommended that they stay at home as much as possible, limit engagement to a very small network for short periods of time, while remaining physically distanced.When exercising outdoors, it is important to maintain two metres distance from others and wash hands on returning home, the advice states. It is recommended to shop during designated hours only, while wearing a face covering, and to avoid public transport.Can I visit a relative in a nursing home?Visits to long-term residential care facilities continue to be suspended under Level 5 aside from “critical and compassionate circumstances”.What about public transport?Face coverings must continue to be worn on public transport. People should only use public transport if they are essential workers or for essential purposes only. People are advised to walk or cycle where possible.Public transport capacity will be restricted to 25 per cent to allow essential workers to get to work. School transport will be unaffected.What are these new penaltiesfines for breaking the restrictions?Under new legislation agreed by the Cabinet on Tuesday night, gardaí will be empowered to arrive at a property and direct that any gathering in breach of public health guidelines be stopped.Those who are found to be organising parties or gatherings could face a fine of up to €1,000 in the first instance or imprisonment for one month, or both. Second offenders face a fine of up to €1,500 or three months imprisonment, or both.

driving","story":"Celebrities facing driving bans will have to prove they can\u0027t take public transport if they claim “exceptional hardship” in their bid to keep their licences, under new court rules.New sentencing guidelines stipulate that magistrates must have evidence from anyone facing a ban that other modes of transport are not viable before accepting any claim of “exceptional hardship” from disqualification.The move follows claims that the controversial defence of “exceptional hardship” to avoid a driving ban has been exploited by celebrities and other wealthy motorists with the money to hire expensive lawyers.Celebrities who have successfully used the defence include comedian Steve Coogan, the TV chef Tom Kerridge, former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff, and pop star Gareth Gates.The most controversial, however, was a property millionaire facing a driving ban who said that having to hire chauffeurs would be an “exceptional hardship.”He claimed that during a previous ban he went through “five or six” drivers who would not pick him up during the anti-social hours he worked.The new sentencing council guidelines, which come into effect this month after a consultation, say magistrates must be strict about defining “exceptional hardship” for anyone facing a ban after totting up 12 or more points on their licence, irrespective of their wealth or background.They warn that a ban can\u0027t be an “inconvenience,” or simply “hardship,” but must be exceptional and the motorist must prove that on oath, and with evidence that meets the civil standard of proof, that is beyond the balance of probabilities.The guidelines acknowledge that everyone who is disqualified and their immediate families suffer hardship but tell magistrates that this is the “deterrent objective.”It extends to using the absence of alternative travel as an excuse.“Courts should be cautious before accepting assertions of exceptional hardship without evidence that alternatives (including alternative means of transport) for avoiding exceptional hardship are not viable,” said the guidelines.Some celebrities and singers who, like freelancers, can rely on short-term contracts for their earnings have managed to escape bans by claiming that being unable to drive could jeopardise these.However, the guidelines state: “Loss of employment will not in itself necessarily amount to exceptional hardship.“Whether or not it does will depend on the circumstances of the offender and the consequences of that loss of employment on the offender andor others.”Even the specialist motoring solicitor Nick Freeman, known as “Mr Loophole,” has called for the use of the defence to be tackled after it was revealed one unnamed driver from the west Midlands was still allowed to drive after clocking up 54 points on his licence.Mr Freeman who has successfully defended celebrity clients including Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Paddy McGuiness and Andrew Flintoff, has said it was inappropriate to allow the “exceptional hardship” defence when bundling together multiple offences.“There should be one exceptional hardship argument for one offence. What we have now is not a loophole. It’s bad law and it’s why the legislation sorely needs redrafting,” he said.\u0027If successfully argued, the offender is back on the road despite the vast number of points on his licence. \u0027It\u0027s so simple.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"head uk vaccines task force volunteers guinea pig us made vaccine","story":"The head of the UK Vaccines Task Force has revealed she has volunteered for a trial of a US-made Covid-19 jab, and has praised the “Rolls Royce” treatment provided by staff.Kate Bingham, in charge of coordinating efforts to roll out a safe and effective vaccine across Britain as quickly as possible, went public with her experience on Sunday, and encouraged others to sign up for the Novavax trial.The American candidate drug is only the second to enter phase III trials, meaning it is being trialed on a large number of people across a range of ages, to gauge its real-world effectiveness in protecting against the virus.The OxfordAstraZeneca candidate is considered to be furthest ahead in the race, with phase III results expected by the end of the year.Because it is a ‘blind’ study, Ms Bingham, one of up to 15,000 UK participants, does not know if she has been given the vaccine or a placebo.“I was extremely impressed with the ‘Rolls-Royce’ treatment I was promised all trial volunteers receive, when I went along to the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust for my first injection,” she wrote in an email to members of the Covid-19 Vaccine Registry.She added: “I won’t know until the end of the study which one I received.

The chief engineer, who is also from Greece, maintained his station in the engine room during the dramatic mission.When darkness fell, the captain switched off the lights and turned the tanker onto a westerly course, into the wind, to make it easier for the Wildcat and Merlin Mk 4 helicopters to hover.It is understood that the Royal Navy’s Special Boat Service team split in two and enacted a ‘pincer’ movement on the boat to trap the stowaways.They used dazzling lights to disorientate the men, who gave up their fight almost immediately. Reports claim they had sharpened objects or even knives. The operation lasted just nine minutes (see video below). The captain was lauded for his “exemplary response and calmness” in a “difficult” situation by the ship’s owners, Navios Tanker Management.The stowaways have been arrested on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force” and could face life sentences if charged and found guilty.However, there are fears that the suspected hijackers could seek political asylum in the UK now that they have made it to shore.Tony Smith, former director general of the Border Force, said he would be “very surprised” if the group did not claim asylum, but said law enforcement authorities needed to take a tough stance to deter others from taking similar action.“We have got to get the message out that stowing away is not going to work and you will find yourself in prison,” he said.The men are currently being held at police stations across Hampshire.The mission came just two weeks after more suspected Nigerian stowaways were found on an oil tanker coming out of Lagos.A remarkable picture (see below) shows three men sat on the rudder of the Norwegian tanker “Champion Pula” having spent ten days hiding just metres above the ship’s propellers.The ship was reportedly denied entry to the Canaries by Spanish authorities and after a two day stand off, it set course for Herøya, Norway, Bergens Tidende reported.“A Spanish boat put the headlights on the rudder, then we saw the men sitting there,” said Karl L. Kvalheim, CEO of Champion Tankers.They were brought on board and eventually arrested on October 17 by Norwegian authorities.“We will probably check our ships more thoroughly before they leave Nigeria from now on,” Mr Kvalheim added.The men suspected of sparking trouble on the Nave Andromeda could face a long legal battle to stay in the UK, but their deportation is not guaranteed.David Wood, director general of immigration enforcement at the Home Office until 2015, warned that even if the men were jailed for more than three years, they could still fight deportation under Article 3 of the Human Rights Act.“If you get a substantial term in prison, the human rights act allows for asylum status to be removed but it doesn’t overcome Article 3,” said Mr Wood.The other problem would be securing the consent of Nigeria to take the stowaways back once they had served any prison sentence, notwithstanding any Article 3 claim, added Mr Wood.“At the end of the day, they don’t say we are not taking these people back. They prevaricate,” he said. “They say, \u0027We are not satisfied that this person is Nigerian’ and don’t engage in any debate about it.”It comes as ministers attempt to counter a surge of migrants crossing the channel (see video below of migrants arriving on Kent beach in September) which have hit 7,500 already this year, almost four times the 1,900 in the whole of 2019.A number of deportation flights have been grounded by last minute appeals on human rights grounds.Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, is understood to be looking to curtail the use of Article 3, which has been exploited by murderers, rapists and other serious criminals. Strict limits will be placed on the types of asylum appeals which can rely on Article 3 as part of Ms Patel’s plans to fix what she claims is a “broken” asylum system.Two years ago, four migrants from Nigeria and Libya sparked trouble on a container ship during a 14-hour stand-off in the Thames Estuary in December 2018, waving metal poles and lobbing faeces, before claiming asylum in the UK.The group’s immigration status is due to be “reviewed” by the Border Force upon completion of their jail sentences.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid immunity may last months study finds","story":"Immunity to coronavirus may only last a matter of a months, according to new research that could hinder the rollout of a successful vaccine.A study by Imperial College London, which involved 365,000 people, showed that antibodies in the population fell by more than a quarter in just three months.Scientists said the findings suggested a rapid decline in immunity – which could mean that even if a successful vaccine is found, it might have to be administered twice a year.The mass research indicated that, by last month, fewer than one in 20 people had developed antibodies to Covid. Commissioned by the Department of Health, it is part of the largest piece of a research programme informing Government policies.Its findings showed that by June, after the first wave of the pandemic, just six per cent of the population had developed antibodies, which suggest some level of protection against the virus. Three months later, that figure had dropped to 4.4 per cent, with most of the decline happening within just six weeks. The sharpest fall was seen in those most in need of protection, with antibody levels among the over-75s reducing by close to 40 per cent between June and September. Scientists said the findings showed Britain is miles off achieving herd immunity, which they warned might never be reached without a vaccine. However, the research did not examine the role played by other forms of immunity. Some scientists believe the part played by T-cells – a type of white blood cell that helps the immune system fight off viruses and is linked with prior infections by common colds – could be more crucial in fighting the virus.Scientists analysed home fingerprick test samples from hundreds of thousands of adults to establish detectable antibody levels over a period of three months, and found levels fell by 26.5 per cent overall. The largest fall was among those most vulnerable to serious illness from Covid. Among those aged 75 and over, antibody levels fell by 39 per cent, while a drop of only 15 per cent was seen in those aged between 18 and 24.Researchers stressed that it is not yet known what level of antibody response is required to protect against reinfection – meaning it is possible that even levels of antibodies that were not found by the tests were offering some protection.  But they said the findings suggested a significant rapid decline in immunity, raising the prospect that those infected by Covid could suffer repeat infections in further waves.  The possibility that a vaccine may have to be administered as often as every six months increases the scale of the challenge ahead.  However, the researchers said vaccines may prove more powerful than natural immunity. On Monday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said the NHS and the Army were working on plans to roll out the vaccine programme as soon as a breakthrough is achieved. He said he expected the bulk of the rollout to occur in the first half of next year, although he had not ruled out the possibility that some jabs might be administered before Christmas. NHS workers are expected to be among the first to be offered vaccines. On Monday, the researchers warned that Britain is a long, long way from anything approaching herd immunity. Helen Ward, a professor of public health at Imperial and the lead researcher, said: I think what we are showing is that there is a really big challenge to that, which is that immunity is waning quite rapidly. After three months, we\u0027ve already shown a 26 per cent decline in antibodies.When you think that 95 out of 100 people are unlikely to be immune, and therefore likely to be susceptible, then we are a long, long way, from anything resembling a population level protection against transmission. Professor Wendy Barclay, the head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial, said the findings suggested Covid is likely to work in the same way as the common cold, meaning it can reinfect regularly. She said: Seasonal coronaviruses that circulate every winter and cause common colds can reinfect people after six to 12 months – and we suspect that the way that the body reacts to infection with this new coronavirus is rather similar to that. We don\u0027t yet know what level of antibody is needed in a person\u0027s blood to protect them from infection or reinfection from SARS-CoV-2,  but of course that level is a crucial thing to begin to understand. Most of the vaccine strategies are aiming to produce that level, and that level will feed into whether or not a population becomes immune or has any level of immunity.Prof Barclay warned that Britain was miles off herd immunity. Graham Cooke, professor of infectious diseases at Imperial, said: The big picture here is that, after the first wave, the great majority of the country still did not have evidence of protective immunity.So although we are seeing a decline in the proportion of people who are testing positive, we still have a great majority of people who are unlikely to have been exposed. So the need for a vaccine is still very large if you want to try and get a large level of protection in the population.People are starting to think about what we will need to do to boost vaccines periodically to keep levels of protection high, depending on what happens with those vaccines and what sort of strength of immune responses will be developed and how long they\u0027ll last for. The health minister Minister Lord Bethell said the study was a critical piece of research, helping us to understand the nature of Covid-19 antibodies over time and improve our understanding about the virus itself. He added: We rely on this kind of important research to inform our continued response to the disease, so we can continue to take the right action at the right time. It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them – this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to Covid-19.Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with Government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a test if you have symptoms, and always remembering Hands, Face, Space.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont let woke pupils dictate can taught","story":"Benenden is a very good girls’ boarding school. I know this is as a former parent and governor. Samantha Price is its very good head \u2028I do not know her, but believe this from the testimony of current pupils and parents.Now she is in a spot. Addressing school assembly during Black History Month, which some pupils had been studying, she explained the history of the month itself. When it began in 1926, she told them, its founders called it Negro History Week. This illustrated how attitudes to words could change. She was encouraging a debate about whether there should be one special month, or whether black history should be part of all history, all the time.Despite the context, the use of the word “negro” was too much for some pupils. They wrote messages of complaint. Some militants, it seems, even called for a boycott of a proposed follow-up meeting with Mrs Price, \u2028 like some virtue-signalling version of St Trinian’s.Mrs Price handled the situation skilfully. She would not accept a boycott and successfully held a proper meeting. Everyone sat down amid courtesy and tea. Pupils digested her view that it was part of their education to debate rather than cancel. If they did not learn this, how could they prepare properly for the rougher worlds of university and beyond? In this context, she apologised for not having “caveated” the offending word even more strongly.Heavily backed by parents and staff, Mrs Price restored confidence. Her high reputation saw to that, allowing her to take the risk – always high for people in leadership positions – of saying sorry.But the tale is a sobering one, for at least two reasons.The first is Covid. The school assembly took place, I gather, on Microsoft Teams. It is hard to imagine the same trouble blowing up if the well-liked head had been addressing all the girls in the flesh.The second is that such protests are part of a trend sweeping through many institutions. People who are not – and should not be – in charge, act as if they are. In museums, for example, the junior staff try to radicalise the collections. In schools and universities, it is woke students who try to dictate what everyone should be taught, sometimes going public as they do so.If they can do that, what is the point of being taught at all?In Channel 4’s extraordinary story of how the BBC Panorama programme tricked Diana, Princess of Wales, into giving her famous 1995 interview with Martin Bashir, one person stood out – my predecessor as editor of this paper, Max Hastings.Sir Max revealed that the Princess had visited him earlier that year to offer him an intimate interview. Concerned for the monarchy and the welfare of both sides of the broken marriage, he refused. “Say nothing” was his advice. Fooled by Bashir, Diana ignored it and pressed ahead.Max Hastings seems slightly rueful now. He knows that refusing such a scoop was not what most hardened Fleet Street hands would see as good journalism. But I would argue he should not reproach himself.After all, the horrors of the royal marriage could have remained a private story so long as both principals told the world nothing. It was better that way – for the warring parties, their children and the monarchy.The trouble started when the Princess let her friends secretly brief Andrew Morton for his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story. This undermined those in the media, including Sir Max and his deputy (me), who were trying to defend her privacy.In 1994, the Prince of Wales deepened the mess by admitting his adultery in a BBC interview with Jonathan Dimbleby. After that, his estranged wife naturally wanted to hit back, and disastrously chose Bashir.And so the war of the Waleses has gone on ever since, harming \u2028everyone involved. Harry and Meghan’s ill-judged, but psychologically understandable, revolt against the monarchy is one of the recent results.Surely Sir Max was right. Britain would have been a happier country if the Prince and Princess had \u2028listened to him.As a new boy in the House of Lords, I would expect not to understand the proceedings at first, even in usual times. In the Covid era, the confusion doubles.It matters that any Parliament is a physical place where its members can meet, otherwise they cannot bond. At present, peers can gather in the Lords itself (as can MPs in the Commons), but only in socially distanced numbers. Lords staff are patient and resourceful in helping us through, but it is a sort of half-life.Anyway, I have now mastered virtual voting. Through a secure system called peerhub, I can vote whenever my mobile phone and I are together. The phone replicates the noise of the Lords ision bell – a strange sound on a train – and I have 11 minutes to press a button.This procedure is a lot better than nothing, but I hope it does not survive the end of Covid. Without the act of entering the ision lobby, one feels dangerously detached.In Lords parlance, one never votes “Yes” or “No”, or “For” or “Against”, but “Content” or “Not Content”. In all my votes so far, I have been “Not Content” – an expression, perhaps, of my resentment against Covid’s restrictions.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tensions secularism islam deepening france","story":"Following the murder of a French teacher for showing his pupils cartoons deemed offensive to Muslims because they depict the Prophet Mohammed, President Macron reaffirmed his country’s belief in secularism, or laïcité. In doing so he asserted that Islam was “a religion that is in crisis today all over the world”.This has angered the leaders of Muslim countries, notably Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, who has urged a boycott of French goods on his people. This tension between secularism and Islam has become ever more pronounced in recent years, especially in France.Five years ago, a dozen staff members of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were killed for publishing the very cartoons that cost teacher Samuel Paty his life earlier this month. The murder emphasised the gulf in France as a majority seek to reassert their traditional secularism. Laïcité was originally designed to counter the power of the Roman Catholic Church.Perhaps President Macron might have better phrased his statement by directing it not at Islam itself but at the leaders of some Muslim countries. President Erdogan, in particular, pursues policies in the Middle East and North Africa that foment the sentiments on which radicals feed. Rather than attack a fellow Nato member, he could more usefully denounce those who perpetrate violence in the name of the religion he follows.For his part, Mr Macron risks misunderstanding what he is dealing with by vowing to build a variety of Islam “that can be compatible with the Enlightenment”. Yet laïcité goes beyond the practices in other Western countries, like the UK, which do allow a public role for different religions.

Most famously, it was behind the modelling that persuaded Boris Johnson to order the country into full lockdown in March. The study being published now is no less significant. For months, the Government\u0027s approach to the pandemic has been predicated on the assumption that a vaccine will ultimately come to the rescue. Until then, measures can only buy time. If successful, restrictions on liberty can push down the \u0027R\u0027 rate, reducing levels of infection, saving lives and preventing the NHS from becoming overwhelmed.All of this is, of course, a short-term measure with colossal costs, not just to the economy but also in lives lost from diseases other than Covid-19. But the research suggests a still more fatal flaw in the strategy – that such policies could be counting on a breakthrough that may never come. Imperial\u0027s scientists analysed the results of finger prick tests on hundreds of thousands of people to establish antibody levels in communities across England between late June and September. They found that across the country, antibody prevalence – which only reached six per cent in June – than saw a significant decline. Overall, it fell to 4.4 per cent within three months, a fall of more than one quarter.However, scientists are wrestling with major uncertainties when it comes to Covid-19. An antibody response suggests some protection against future disease, but no one knows how much. The purpose of vaccines is to create this response in those who have not been infected with Covid-19, thus creating herd immunity. If such protection only lasts a matter of weeks, or months, how effective could any vaccine be? And would it have to be administered so often that the scale of the challenge defeats us? Here, yet more unknowns come into play. Scientists do not know what level of antibody response is required to protect against Covid-19. Low levels, perhaps even undetectable by current testing, could be enough to offer some protection. Antibodies are not the body\u0027s only defence. There is significant interest in the part played by T-cells, a type of white blood cell that helps the immune system fight off viruses, which some believe may be even more important in fighting off Covid.Such an immune response has been linked to previous exposure to common cold coronaviruses, and could explain why children are more resilient to Covid-19. Researchers behind the study say that, in fact, their findings underline the need for an effective vaccine. They point out that a vaccine may prove far more powerful than any natural immunity.While Covid-19 is the only coronavirus to have become a household name, scientists have a long history of other types of coronaviruses, most notably the common cold. This leads them to believe it is likely that the virus could reinfect people every six to 12 months, which could mean a vaccine programme would have to be boosted very regularly.The hope is that an effective vaccine would be strong enough that it could be administered annually, like a flu jab.  If it needs to be given more often than that, the logistical hurdles ahead get still more difficult.  Monday\u0027s findings will give the Government a new set of questions, headaches, and trade-offs to consider. And they are likely to be used to support a range of arguments, many of which are in conflict. Some will say they show the hopelessness of efforts to contain Covid-19, raising the prospect of interminable restrictions which are unsustainable.Others will say they demonstrate the need for still more strict restrictions, while every effort is thrown into the development and mass rollout of a vaccine.

The team injected half the bats with lipopolysaccharide, an immune-challenging substance, to make them sick while the other half received saline injections.The researchers then glued proximity sensors to the bats and released them back into their tree.The team tracked changes over time in the associations among the 16 sick bats and 15 control bats.The researchers found that the animals that were ill spent less time near others, associated with fewer group mates and were less socially connected to those that were healthy.The study, published in Behavioural Ecology, found that in the six hours after injection, a sick bat associated on average with four fewer associates than a bat that had been injected with saline.On average a control bat had a 49 per cent chance of associating with each control bat, but only a 35 per cent chance of associating with a sick bat.They also found that these differences declined after the first six hours and when the bats were sleeping or foraging outside.The study\u0027s lead author, Simon Ripperger, from the department of ecology, evolution, and organismal biology, at the Ohio State University, said: The sensors gave us an amazing new window into how the social behaviour of these bats changed from hour to hour and even minute to minute during the course of the day and night, even while they are hidden in the darkness of a hollow tree.We\u0027ve gone from collecting data every day to every few seconds.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"child poverty champion marcus rashfords","story":"NewsChild poverty champion Marcus Rashfords special tattoo with heartfelt meaningEXCLUSIVE: An inking of a child playing with a ball beneath a cherry tree hints at the roots that set the young footballer on his path to becoming a champion for the nations hungry kidsmirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByPaul Byrne:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start inCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video marcus-rashford-receives-pride-britain-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The inking is of a small child playing with a ball beneath a cherry tree. In the background is the neat terraced home where the England and Manchester United striker lived as a youngster. Children still play on the patch of the grass where he practised day and night and where his skills began to blossom. And in the surrounding houses, neighbours speak glowingly to the Mirror about the local boy made good who is now waging war on poverty. Kate Jenner, , lives in Marcus’ former family home with her we Lizzie, . The couple had no idea about the famous ex resident when they first moved in. Kate said: “We used to get taxi drivers dropping us off and they’d say ‘you live in Marcus Rashford’s old house’.” And she soon realised how much the down to earth footballer is admired in the community. The HR manager said: “People are aware he has got those roots in the local area and they increasingly ask about it, which is good. “His old primary school is just down the way and he visits there regularly. “And with all the work he has done recently with food vouchers for the kids, it has gone down really well around here.”Kate does not have children but thinks his campaign is “absolutely fantastic”. “It is a cracking thing and it is only right as far as I’m concerned. Parents should be able to put food on the table for their kids. “He recognises that some parents struggle to do that and they need some support. “If they are getting food vouchers in term time, why not extend that to make sure it is not a struggle for parents ” She added: “He is a good lad, he really is. He just gets it and he understands. We are not struggling to put food on the table but we absolutely understand that other people across the country are. He understands that. He has been brought up with that as his lived experience and wants to do what he can and use his voice and his influence to improve things for those that are struggling.” The house in Wythenshawe, Manchester, is owned by Marcus’ mum Melanie and he has ed on a couple of occasions for photo shoots, to the delight of residents. Next door but one lives Jan Garvey, , and her husband David, . And at the mere mention of his name, Jan reaches for one of her proudest possessions, a photo of her and Marcus leaning against the cherry tree. Jan said: “He has actually got a tattoo of that tree.”  And she added: “He is a fantastic man. Everybody around here is so proud of him. He is a lovely lad. “When we moved in Marcus had just moved out but he does come back and I had my photo taken with him in his England kit.” She added: “He was here with a film crew and he came, I think they were doing a documentary about him. “I went out and said ‘can I have my photo taken with you’.  “He was kicking a ball about with the local children on the front. “I think he is just wonderful. And he has not forgotten his roots.” Jan added: “He is a real inspiration for young people. It shows you can grow up around here andyou work hard you can do well. “He is a very kind person to do what he is doing. He does not to have to do it does he ” Jan is one of more than , people who have signed Rashford’s online petition demanding an expansion of the free school meal holiday scheme into next year. “I’m fully behind it. I’m very proud of him” she said.  And she smiled: “I think with Marcus and Andy Burnham, we can’t really complain around here.” Another neighbour, Anson Stephen, , used to watch the young Marcus kicking his ball for hours on end on the same turf where his two young sons, Jake, nine, and Dominic, five, now play. “He was very dedicated. Marcus always had a football, at night time, in the morning time. He was very focused on his football. “He was a very nice lad. All the family were lovely” he said.  Anson, a legal executive, also backs player’s efforts to help children across the UK. “My children do not have free school meals but I think it is a really good idea. “Marcus has experienced struggles so he understands what sort of struggles other children have and he is trying to do something that will really benefit them.” He added: “People around here are very proud of him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dear tories stop playing food","story":"NewsopinionDear the Tories: stop playing with the food, and just let us eat itThe Tories see a crisis and wonder how to make it look better.

So, aged , she started a charity to provide them with meals and toiletries.She didnapost ask who they were, how they voted, orthey were good parents. She just did what was needed to alleviate, a little, the problems of people she did not know. A sick child feeding anguished parents. A rich footballer pointing at child poverty. Both Emmie and Marcus Rashford, her fellow Pride of Britain award winner, are the sort of people who, in a crisis, look at the world and ask themselves how they can improve it for others.  And then we have the sort of people who look at a crisis and ask how they can improve it for themselves. Those who see a vote to feed hungry children as an attack on their right to feel successful. People who see a backlash against that vote as a political problem, rather than a moral one. The sort who, realising they are wrong, want things to look better, rather than be better.Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said the government had misunderstood the mood of the country. Former Childrenaposs Minister Tim Loughton said it was politically a mistake. And Mansfield MP Tory McTwatface said he was taken out of context when he agreed that food vouchers equated with £ a week on crack.It all rather ignores the fact that itaposs about morality, not mood people, not point-scoring and that food vouchers canapost be traded for drugs, for the simple reason that dealers can afford to feed themselves. Letaposs get this clear. Voting against feeding hungry children is a vote FOR making them go hungry. The money local authorities are using to plug the gap is cash that was intended for other hardships. The issue is not one of politics, or popularity, but about whataposs right and whataposs wrong.And to whinge about being taken out of context when even your excuses reek of an over-promoted adolescent with all the wit and personal charm of ear wax just makes it clear, to the world at large and your constituency voters in particular, that weaposd all be better offyou stood down to spend less time in your orices. Wonderingto feed children during school holidays is not about subbing irresponsible parents, or crackheads, or paying for other peopleaposs lestyle choices. Itaposs about why, exactly, anyone has to wonder about it. Itaposs about MPs who just voted themselves a rise to £, giving the equivalent of . minutesapos worth of those earnings to the kids who in the years to come will have to pay for their bad policies.Itaposs about parents furloughed on % pay through no fault of their own having to pay % of the rent, council tax, and fuel bills and suddenly finding thereaposs little left for anything . Itaposs about millions of working families who were already struggling on a minimum wage of £. an hour, or £. for a full dayaposs work, with the prospect of getting just £. a day on the dole. Itaposs about the fact those people in this crisis are more likely to be mums, or pregnant, or young, or nearing retirement.A furloughed minimum-wage mum gets just £. an hour. An MP gets  times that, infor screwing her over. And sheaposd have to wait  years to earn the £, her Prime Minister once described as chicken feed. If that mum got a £ food voucher, sheaposd have £. a day to feed her child. Over a week, that might stretch to a bag of frozen chicken nuggets, a packet of Weetabix,  pints of milk, and some wonky veg. A child would still be malnourished on that, still lose weight, still risk growing up a little wonky themselves, but itaposs better than nothing. It is equivalent to less than half of the £. pan-seared mackerel with heritage tomato ceviche, elderflower gel, horseradish and charred cucumber available as a starter in the MPsapos subsidised dining room. The vote they held was the same as asking themselves whether theyaposd be prepared to allow just one forkful of their mini sirloin of beef, with mini steak and kidney pudding, roasted baby carrots, savoy cabbage and potato terrinefind its way into the mouth of a skinny -year-old. And the debate theyaposre having now is no dferent to asking themselves, before they do so, whether that childaposs parents are virtuous enough to merit their offspring receiving this square mouthful of charity. Those who question whether the poor should get help do so because they fear it will move the poor a little closer to them. Societyaposs isions are beneficial,your sense of self-worth comes from the belief you are doing better than others. Alleviating hunger means there is less space in which to be such an arsehole. Confronted with widespread anger over ordering his MPs to vote against feeding vulnerable children, Boris Johnson is not slapping his head and saying Gadzooks! If only Iaposd known! Heaposs delaying the u-turn until he can find a way to blame Rishi Sunak for it, and Rishi is probably delaying Treasury agreement until he can blame someone . So when that u-turn comes, it wonapost be because the government realised it was wrong. It will be because the likes of Marcus Rashford - and the thousands of people nationwide now offering their own neighbours and customers a packed lunch for youngsters - embarrassed them. They have not, unfortunately, managed to educate them.

Mr Anderson, whose “inspiring” brother Bill was one of  people to die in Liverpool last week, said the city had lost  hospitality firms. But he told BBC Breakfast: “This is a fight against a virus that we can’t see but we know is there and we know it’s taken untold damage on peopleaposs wellbeing, health, mental health, but also a huge toll on families whose members are dying as a result. “That has to be our priority, that has to be the number one focus in reducing the Covid infection rate in the city. ”Soanything was needed and required to actually bring it down faster or make things tougher, then I would do that.” However, he did add: “I want to make sure that we are giving Tier  a chance to seethe measures that are in place now have that impact.

The i newspaper suggests those could include a ‘Tier ’ of restrictions in which restaurants and non-essential shops are shut.

On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Government would take nothing off the table when asked about a possible Tier . It came as Mr Anderson, , paid moving tribute to his brother after his death from coronavirus.  He said he was unable to speak to Bill for a final time after cancelling an incoming call because he was busy discussing Tier . “He was taken into hospital on Friday afternoon about pm, immediately put into ICU and within eight hours he’d died. His heart had given up,” he told BBC Breakfast. “The sad thing was Bill often spoke to me a couple of times a week and sometimes I’d just press the button saying ‘call you later, sorry, busy’. “And I did that because I was so busy, we were dealing with funding issues on the phone to government, dferent things, as Liverpool was entering Tier .

Warrington will become the fourth area of England to join Tier  at midnight tonight, with pubs and bars forced to shut in the town of , people. And parts of Nottinghamshirewill change to the highest alert level on Thursday after local leaders met the government this afternoon. Meanwhile, Tier  talks are ongoing with West Yorkshire , and were reopened with the North Eastbut the status is unclear. Leaders in the North East said on Monday that they would resist moves to Tier . The government finally confirmed Warrington will enter Tier  this afternoon, days after the news was confirmed by MPs and the council. Pubs and bars will be forced to shut unless they can operate as a restaurant, and can only serve alcohol with “substantial” meals.People will be banned from meeting those not in their household or bubble, either indoors or in private outdoor spaces like gardens. Travel in and out of the area will be advised against in the restrictions, which last  days before a review. And on top of normal Tier  rules, betting and gaming shops, casinos and soft play centres in Warrington must shut. The change means .million people are now in Tier  in Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Warrington. Parts of Nottinghamshire will become the fth region to enter a Tier  lockdown this week, meaning .million people will be under the tightest restrictions. A further .million are in Tier  lockdown. Nottingham City Council confirmed that Nottingham, Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushclfe Council areas would be placed under the toughest restrictions at midnight on Thursday. Further measures specic to these areas of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire will be announced tomorrow. Council leaders in Nottinghamshire had been pushing for a decision on entering Tier  today. But sources said talks hit a road-block over the decision to involve just four of the county’s eight boroughs - Nottingham, Gedling, Broxtowe and Rushclfe. Talks last week were thought to have focused on those boroughs but since then infection rates in three of the other four areas - Mansfield, Ashfield and Bassetlaw - have been “rising by the minute”, a local source said. Yet the councils for those areas were not involved in the initial talks. The eighth borough is Newark - constituency of the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick who has led Tier  lockdown talks.  Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood said case rates were falling in the city and rising where in the county. She said she had had no formal meetings since Friday and was trying to figure out why talks were dragging on so long. She told the Mirror: “I’m a bit in the dark,I’m brutally honest. I don’t really understand why - it didn’t seem like there was much to discuss when I spoke to them on Friday. So I don’t know what’s changed.” Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome said local officials had been “asked to sign last-minute agreements” to enter Tier , without knowing what funding they’ll get. She told the Nottingham Post: “Nottingham City Council has already had to spend more than £m from its own reserves to cover the cost of the pandemic. After years of cuts, council budgets are already badly overstretched and this canapost go on for any longer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains biggest hoard stuffed one","story":"NewsBritains biggest hoard stuffed into one-bedroom flat sells for £, at auctionRamann Shukla, who died from a heart attack aged  in Nottingham in June, is believed to have started collecting so he could sell them to pay for his retirementmirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByMartin Fricker:,  OCT NewsRamann Shukla kept , items stored in his one-bedroom flat and his mums terraced home\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Research by Imperial College London estimated just .% of adults had some form of immunity against Covid- in September, when cases began to increase again. This is compared with % found to have antibodies between June  and July , and .% between July  and August . The number of people with antibodies fell by . per cent over three months, according to research commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care. The study involved more than , randomly selected adults in England who used finger prick antibody tests at home. Between  June and  September, the proportion of people who tested positive for antibodies dropped from six per cent of the population to . per cent. This suggests antibodies reduce in the weeks or months after a person is infected, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Health Minister Lord Bethell said the study made it clear people are not immune from coronavirus just because they have tested positive for antibodies.He added: “This study led by Imperial and Ipsos MORI is a critical piece of research, helping us to understand the nature of COVID- antibodies over time, and improve our understanding about the virus itself.We rely on this kind of important research to inform our continued response to the disease, so we can continue to take the right action at the right time. “It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them – this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-.“Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a testyou have symptoms and always remember Hands, Face, Space.”  Antibody responses also appear to y over time depending on a person’s age and symptoms. The study suggested that people who did not show Covid- symptoms are likely to lose detectable antibodies sooner than those who had signs of the disease. The findings also show the loss of antibodies was slower in  to -year-olds compared with those aged  and over. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme, said: “Our study shows that over time there is reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-. It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts.  If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab testthey have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required.” Helen Ward, one of the lead authors of the antibody report, said: “This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others.” The study results indicate the first wave of the epidemic took place over a short period in March and April.  It appears there was then a steep decline in the proportion of people who reported having Covid- symptoms and who tested positive for antibodies from early April - two weeks after national lockdown. While positive antibody tests declined in the general population, the number of health workers who tested positive for them did not change. Researchers believe this could be because of higher initial or repeated exposure. There was a decline in positive antibody tests in people across all age groups, although the smallest was among people aged between  to  years.

As a result, Karrine says she has attained mask-wearing exemption from her doctor and has a form to prove it. She claims a bus driver demanded details of her condition - before telling her apositaposs people like you who spread coronavirusapos on her journey from Heywood to Piccadilly on Monday.She told the Manchester Evening News sheaposd never felt so embarrassed in her le.Karrine claims there were other passengers on the bus not wearing masks. She suggested the driver was discriminating against her - prompting him to allegedly demand she get off. When Karrine refused and started filming him, she says the driver abandoned a bus-full of passengers to sit at a bus stop opposite. Diamond Bus North West have said they are investigating the alleged incident. Karrine told the Manchester Evening News : Iaposve never felt so embarrassed in my le. This experience has left me feeling I donapost want to get on a bus again.  I canapost drive because of my medical condition and the bus is the only way I can pick up my daughter. Iaposve never had an experience like this before. Some people may feel comfortable wearing a lanyard about their disability but Iaposm  and I donapost want to be wearing something round my neck. Karrine was travelling from Heywood to Piccadilly after dropping her daughter at her grandparentsapos at around .pm on Monday, when her ordeal unfolded. Karrine, who is currently signed off from her job at an IVF clinic due to her condition, was at the bus stop when the  Diamond bus pulled up.  She said: The driver was gesturing to say whereaposs my mask and wouldnapost open the door. I was asking him to please open the door. Karrine says the driver finally let her on board, and she showed her mask exemption pass as she tapped on. But the driver, she claims, then proceeded to ask her why she was exempt and when she refused to tell him, accused her of apostaking the mickapos. She added: He was saying apositaposs medically proven that masks donapost affect medical conditions and I was telling him I didnapost want to talk to him about this. Karrine says she resorted to taking out her medicine and showing evidence of her condition on her phone - but that when she took a seat he continued to harangue her from the driveraposs cab.  She added: I could tell he was getting angry. He said aposItaposs people like you who spread coronavirusapos. Karrine says there were other passengers on the bus not wearing masks, adding: They were asking me what was going on. One boy was wearing a lanyard and he said the driver hadnapost questioned him when he got on. Karrine, who began to film her experience because she felt discriminated against, added: I asked himit was my race and he askedI was calling him racist.  The driver, Karrine says, then demanded she get off the bus, and when she refused, pulled over, left the cab and went to sit at a bus stop across the road - leaving a bus full of passengers. All passengers, Karrine said, were forced to get off the bus and get the next one. Karrine has complained to Diamond.

I’ve lodged two formal complaints with housing and called hundreds of times but theyare not interested and do absolutely nothing to help.” Self-employed Kelly went onto describe how the only action taken so far was the use of rat poison which has killed some of the infestation but left behind a horrendous stench emanating from the dead carcasses that haven’t been removed. “We’ve been here two years and the problem still isn’t solved. Someone came and put the rat poison down but they haven’t been back since and the smell is worse than ever.

Earlier this month Julie Cooper, who runs The Don bar in Stockton, County Durham started to feel seriously run down and began to have dficulties breathing. The -year-old was forced to stay overnight at the University Hospital of North Tees when she struggled to take in air, Teesside Live reported. Julie, who hopes to open a new pub, The Last Post, on Rembrance Sunday, said the virus is the worst thing she has ever had to contend with. She said: Itaposs frightening, you donapost know whether you are going to get through it. I have been in bed for nine days. I have got quite a high pain threshold so it really has hit me. I canapost breath and when I get out of bed I feel faint. When I manage to get to the toilet, I have coughing fits and I canapost breathe. Itaposs like you feel yourself suffocating and you canapost do anything about it. Itaposs an awful feeling. Youaposre just there for hours and hours on your own trying to breathe. You either get better or you get worse and end up in intensive care. You just have to sit and wait, thataposs all you can do. Julie, who suffers from bronchitis, believes she may have contracted coronavirus from somebody who came into her bar.  During the first few days of her illness she called for an ambulance twice because she could not breath. The first time the ambulance arrived she was told she was not ill enough to be taken to hospital. The following day she was forced to call them again and was transported to University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton. While staying at the hospital overnight, she underwent tests and was found to have a shadow on her lungs. Julie said: When the ambulance man first came out he wished me good luck. I thought aposoh god, is that itapos. Itaposs true - thereaposs nothing they can do about it. They havenapost got a cure for it. They canapost give you oxygen unless your body is ready for it. It can do you more damage than good. When I was on the ward with coronavirus patients it was very quiet and very serious. There was nobody talking, most of them had masks on.

Lucky Susan Spearman, , was one of eight neighbours from Blackpool who recently scooped £, between them. Each of the winners received visits from People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, Judie McCourt, who revealed their cheques. The visits were pre-arranged and special arrangements were in place to ensure social distancing rules were observed. But when Susan broke the news of the win to her family and grandchildren, one of the youngsters got a little too excited.  She explained: I don’t think it’s really sunk in how much it is. I’m still floating. We have a few grandchildren who we will treat too. My youngest is nine and after he came home from school he said, ‘Wow nana are you a millionaire !’  I told him I wasn’t quite, but it was still plenty! Susan lives with her husband Joe, who was celebrating his th birthday on the winning weekend. Susan added: This is just fantastic! I had no idea how much it would be, so I just tried to think small. We’ve ordered a new front door for £, and I said to my husband I’d be happy for it to just cover that. Well it’s a lot more than that!  The couple plan to spend their winnings on a dream holiday across Canada, as well as treating their family. Judie McCourt, People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, said: Huge congratulations to all of our winners in Blackpool!

Members of the public normally gather outside St Mary Magdalene Church to see the Monarch, Prince Charles, Camilla, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the family in Sandringham. However in a bid to keep everyone safe amid the Covid pandemic, the family wonapost attend this year - however the Queen still hopes they can celebrate together, reports the Express. The newspaper claims that she hopes the government will scrap the Rule of Six before the big day, which will allow them to be together in some way. As it stands, both the Queen and the Cambridges are living in Tier  areas so canapost mix indoors with other households. Palace staff are working on the assumption that the Queen will travel to Sandringham, where Philip is currently living, and the couple will stay in the main house. Often the royals go to two church services on Christmas Day - the first one in private and the second at the local church where they also meet well-wishers.

Whatever happens in terms of restrictions, itaposs almost certain that their Christmas celebrations will be very dferent this year. They normally kick off their celebrations on Christmas Eve, starting with afternoon tea and opening presents, in line with their German heritage.Prince Philip oversees organising the gts, which are always jokey presents rather than expensive offerings, and tells everyone when they can open them. On Christmas Day they tuck into a traditional feast with all the trimmings at pm.

Jack Lear took a gamble when the country went into lockdown and created a new business selling discounted consumer goods. The -year-old already owned a fancy dress website and had just ordered , costumes ready for Halloween when his market began to shrink by the day, He told Wales Online : “I had already committed to the , costumes and signed contracts. I realised Iaposd dug myself into a pretty big hole with no market to sell them. I could try and weather the storm, which is what most people have done, or I could gamble and start a new business. After reading a report on how Amazon had taken on nearly , workers during the pandemic, Jack realised he could make some serious money.  He decided to invest £, to launch BargainFox, and his first product to take off was beard trimmers – mainly because barbers and hairdressers had to shut up shop during lockdown. He has now expanded the range to more than , dferent products across everything from household goods to baby products to sport and leisure gear. Jack sums up his typical customer type as a bargain hunter. They don’t mind a damaged box – they are interested in what is inside and that they are getting it at a heavily discounted price, he says. He said: Itaposs mind-blowing how big the range is, he says, stood in his original costume warehouse at the family home. I look at Amazon and I guess thataposs what weaposre trying to aspire to. He’s also quadrupled his staff members to  and is looking to take on  more in the run up to Christmas.The house he was building has also stalled while all of his resources are ploughed into the business. He has far from made it but he is well on his way, he adds. It was a bigger risk to do nothing at all. I would rather fail trying than sit back and watch the business die. We havenapost weathered the storm yet – weaposre still in the middle of it. BargainFox draws on much of the experience he has gained from running Bodysocks but its reach is much more ambitious – while the fancy dress goods market worldwide is worth billions consumer and household goods is worth trillions. “We are taking inspiration from Amazon, one of the best warehousing companies in the world.” BargainFox has contracts with retailers to take customer s and liquidation stock – items that are new or as new but sometimes with damaged packaging. On average the thousands of items are discounted by  per cent from the recommended retail price. Jack has always been interested in running his own business and started out buying and selling on eBay when he was just a schoolboy. As soon as he started making enough money he quit his A-levels, though his decision didn’t go down well with his mum. By his s Jack was drawing up designs for fancy dress costumes on Clip Art and sending them to be made a factory in China. Reflecting on his earlier business, Jack said: I didnapost have the ability to invent a new product but I hit on fancy dress because the costumes are quite basic, the design element is quite straightforward and simplistic. But now the process has become a little more sophisticated and some of hes designs have even been ed around the world. Halloween costumes account for nearly half of his entire yearly sales and  per cent of his business goes to America. While the UK market has stalled sales in the US are on course to match last year, which he says he will take as a small victory given the circumstances. In July  he bought the contents of a Manchester based warehouse fro a failed party goods company and suddenly found out he owned more than , products.

He used to spend  minutes each day in double sessions at dferent salons, one for  minutes and the other for  minutes. Now the personal trainer pays £ for unlimited sunbed access at a salon as well as forking out £ a month on self-injected melatonin jabs. Mike, from Brighton, East Sussex, thinks his tanned skin has enhanced his love le and claims it has helped him bed more than  women. The British Association of Dermatologists advises that people should not use sunbeds or sunlamps. Sunbeds and lamps can be more dangerous than natural sunlight because they use a concentrated source of UV radiation, it says. Health risks linked to sunbeds and other UV tanning equipment include skin cancer, premature skin ageing, sunburnt skin and eye irritation. Mike told the Sun : “I can’t live with pale skin, it’s not attractive. I don’t feel good.  “I don’t judge people who are pale — some can’t help it or don’t mind it. “But I love being dark.

The rampant cyclone has passed the eastern coast of America and is currently contained in a very deep area of low pressure out on the Atlantic, sending a frontal system towards the UK. Substantial rainfall will hit the country from Thursday until the weekend, with up to mm of rain predicted in the Welsh mountains, and averages of -mm for the rest of the UK.A yellow weather warning for severe rain has been placed by the Met Office across parts of the west of England from midday Thursday to midnight on Saturday - with flooding and travel disruption a possibility.In the meantime, heavy showers will strike in southwest England this afternoon, with strong winds along the south coast. As a result, the Environment Agency has put two flood alerts in place, around the River Thame and Chalgrove Brook. And by tomorrow the lingering low pressure will result in lots of showers piling into northern and western areas, according to BBC meteorologist Stav Danaos.  Some of these downpours will be heavy, with some hail and thunder and temperatures could plummet as low as C due to the chilly wind, he added. Another frontal system is moving in on Thursday to bring another bout of wet and windy weather - could turn very wet across northwest England and Wales, with a risk of minor flooding, said Mr Danaos. However, as the week goes on, temperatures will turn milder and London could see C on Friday, according to weather charts.  Though parts of the country could see gusts of close to mph as we head into the weekend. The combination of sunshine with blustery showers for the first half of the week could lead to plenty of rainbows, according to Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon.

Michael Gray Sr, , and Shirley Gray, , are accused of keeping a teen boy locked in a basement for four years, and feeding him only scraps of bread and water. The Roane County couple were charged after the body of an -year-old girl allegedly kept in their basement as punishment was found buried at their East Tennessee property over the summer. The Grays appeared in court this week to deny all charges against them in a -count indictment relating to the death of one of their adopted children, and the abuse and neglect of two of the three others, Knox News reports.  They are being investigated over the treatment of children aged  to  from  to May this year. According to Knoxville news station WVLT , investigators were alerted to the childrenaposs plight when police received a call from a member of the public who found a boy wandering along the road alone. He told officers he didn’t know where his parents were or where he was. Police took the child home and contacted local childrenaposs services after the Grays said they were not aware he had left the house. The teen allegedly then told investigators there was another boy, aged around  years old, in the coupleaposs basement, and a dead child buried in the backyard. The Sun reports that court documents show the Grays are accused of keeping two of their children in a wire dog cage. All of the children were said to have been home-schooled and appeared “stunted in growth” when authorities discovered them, according to the coupleaposs arrest warrants. Investigators said Michael Gray admitted that his -year-old daughter had died in  and was buried inside a barn in the yard, according to court documents. Officials alleged she had been kept in the basement as punishment for stealing food and within months, had died. The surviving -year-old boy had also been locked in the basement since June , according to the arrest warrant. It alleged he “had no contact with anyone outside the basement, only given small amounts of food, being white bread and some water.” Shortly after the girl’s body was discovered, the remains of a boy was discovered at another property linked to the couple in Knox County, Tennessee. Reports say at the time of the discovery the second home belonged to the Graysapos son, Michael Anthony Jr, whom investigators allege knew about the abuse the children faced.   The boyaposs death is still being investigated and the Graysapos indictment is not related to that case. The couple did not report either of the childrenaposs deaths and are accused of continuing to receive financial benefits for both of the children who were found dead. In May, Department of Childrenaposs Services commissioner Jenner Nichols released a statement about the case. Words are inadequate. Cruelty such as this makes us question all that we know to be true, she said. I am so grateful to the passersby who saw a child in a situation that just didn’t seem right and stopped to help. That one small action led to the discovery of children who were victims of severe abuse and neglect. Those children are now in a safe place and being cared for and their parents face signicant criminal charges. I am also thankful for our DCS child protective services staff who worked together as a team, followed their instincts to dig a little further when first notied of the situation and immediately alerted law enforcement.

The hugely controversial addition of Amy Coney Barrett as a justice and a vote to prevent Wisconsin mail-in extension could allow Trump to aposstealapos the result, pointing towards possible chaos on November . Some . million Americans have already voted by mail, partof the more than . million who have cast ballots ahead of the election - a record-breaking pace that could lead to the highest US voter turnout by percentage in more than a century. Biden told reporters on Monday he was not overconfident about anything and with the grace of God he would win Pennsylvania, the state where he was born - and a key battleground Trump has identied as the place the fight will be won. Hereaposs all you need to know. The US Senate controversially voted to confirm Trumpaposs nominee Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice just days before the country selects a new leader.Democrats have labelled the rushed nomination process a sham, with Judge Barrettaposs appointment cementing a - conservative majority on the nine-member court, likely for decades to come. The Senate’s leading Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, delivering a scathing assault on his Republican colleagues, told them you will never get your credibility back. Fears Trump may try aposstealapos election after ruling  Hours before swearing in its latest member, the Supreme Court ruled that  the state of Wisconsin couldnapost extend its deadline  for postal ballots to account for mail delays.This could play into the hands of the President, who knows in-person voters are more likely to vote for him, having repeatedly insisted the result must be announced on the night. Experts say it may take days or even weeks to process the huge number of mail-in ballots, spurred by voters seeking to avoid crowded polling stations because of the Covid- pandemic. If he loses on November , Trump can, meanwhile, claim victory on in-person votes and declare Bidenaposs postal votes to be fraudulent and now has even more backing on the Supreme Court to vote in his favourhe decides to challenge the result. Biden aposdoing better than Obama in apos  Barack Obamaaposs successful campaign manager said  Bidenaposs position in the  election is better than the former Presidentaposs second run in . David Plouffe sought to soothe Democrats who are nervous that Trump will again pip them at the post, insisting of Bidenaposs poll lead: Itaposs real. He added that in many states the former Vice President is also doing better than Obama did during his landslide victory in . Did Biden confuse Trump with Bush  Trump didnapost miss a beat in claiming Biden had confused him with former Republican President George W. Bush during the aposI Will Voteapos concert, claiming he needed help from the anchor to get him through. The Democrat had been speaking to host George Lopez when he said: Four more years of George, uh, George, uh, he, uh, are going to find ourselves in position whereuh Trump gets elected uh we are going to be uh, going to be in a dferent world. Whether an actual gaff or not is unclear, but Republican National Committee rapid response director Steve Guest was quick to tweet out a clipped down version of the video in which Lopez was chopped out. Pennsylvania victory and we win whole ballgame  Trump told a boisterous rally in Pennsylvania on Mondaythe Republicans can secure the key swing state - where Biden holds a narrow margin in the polls - we win the whole ballgame. The President went from Allentown to Lititz and then finally to Martinsburg, all towns outside the large suburban hubs where the race may be decided.He told reporters he expected to win Pennsylvania by a larger margin than the .% victory he achieved in defeatingDemocrat Hillary Clinton in . Biden clean energy push economic death sentence  Trump saidPennsylvanians vote for Biden it will mean an existential issue for the state, with the Democrat looking to transition the US away from oil and natural gas. He wants to go with windmills that are made in Germany andChina, Trump told supporters, adding: Bidenaposs plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvaniaaposs energy sector. However, at his own event in the state, Biden assured: Iaposm not shutting down oilfields. Iaposm not eliminating fracking. Iaposminvesting in clean energy. Biden previously said the country should eventually replaceoil with solar, wind and other forms of non-polluting power,adding that his plan for a more climate-friendly economy would create high-paying jobs and boost US businesses. Trump is the worst possible president  Biden, speaking at a rally in Chester, near Philadelphia, stepped up his criticism of Trumpaposs handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than ,people in the United States.He said: The bottom line is, Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to lead us through this pandemic.

Demonstrators gathered outside the th District police headquarters at the University of Penn Police on Monday night - hours after officers shot and killed a man that afternoon. But in the early hours of Tuesday morning tensions rose and rioting broke out across the city. Police clashed with people protesting the violent killing of -year-old Walter Wallace Jr. In a horric video released on social media last night, pedestrians were heard screaming after a truck drove towards a line of police officers leaving one injured on the ground. The silhouette of a person can be seen standing through the sunroof as the truck careers into the officer. The cop was struck by the vehicle on the corner of S nd Street and Walnut Street as a bystander can be heard saying in shock: Oh my god. He hit a cop. Philadelphia Police Sergeant Eric Gripp said the officer, a -year-old woman, was hospitalised in a stable condition with a broken leg and other injuries. He added that the truck was found abandoned nearby. Police said crowds set fire to cars and bins and looted multiple stores late Monday night across the city. During the protest, at least four other officers were hospitalised after they were struck by bricks, investigators told NBC. Protests were in response to the shooting of Walter Wallace by two Philadelphia police officers in Cobbs Creek.  Investigators said Wallace was armed with a kne when he approached the officers and ignored them when they told him to drop the weapon. When he did not put down his kne they shot him, it is claimed. Video from a witness showed Wallace walking toward the officers as a woman, believed to be his mum, tried to restrain him.  It’s unclear in the video however whether or not Wallace is holding a weapon. He was taken to a nearby hospital but was later pronounced dead. Sgt Eric Gripp told the Philadelphia Inquirer that officers ordered Wallace to drop the weapon. But he added that Wallace advanced towards the officers and investigators are reviewing body-worn cameras of what happened.  Wallace’s family have demanded to know why non-lethal force wasn’t used. He said: Why didn’t they use a Taser  His mother was trying to dfuse the situation. The mayor of the city, Jim Kennedy also released a statement last night.

Thankfully, the weekendaposs change is the good one - meaning we got an extra hour kip rather than hearing that dreaded alarm clock even earlier as we do in the spring. But for some it plays havoc with their bedtime routine, and can leave them struggling to nod off or wake up for days. In a bid to tackle this, the clever people at blind and curtain company Hillaryaposs have come up with a calculator which works out exactly what time you need to go to bed depending on what time you need to wake up the next morning. We sleep in -minute cycles, and we should aim to get either five or six of these cycles every night. While the extra hour means itaposs likely weaposll get an extra cycle, it can confuse our bodies and they have to get used to the extra sleep - which sometimes leaves us feeling sluggish. The companyaposs sleep expert, Lucy Askew, tells : It is so important to get a good night’s sleep as this can really affect how youthe next day. Getting decent sleep helps with your productivity, concentration levels and your cognition so it affects almost every aspect of your le. Not only this, but sleep can lower your risk of things like heart disease, helps keep your immune system strong and it is vital for supporting your mental wellbeing.  Lack of sleep has a bigger impact on your health than you may realise. Not only can it affect the way youthe next day, but it can also change your appearance and age your skin quicker. Being sleep deprived can also cause your skin to break out. More serious health problems associated with not getting enough sleep include high blood pressure, diabetes and heart attacks. There are also studies that link not getting enough shut eye with depression.

The solitary bottleneck dolphin appeared in Dingle Bay, off the coast of County Kerry in  and since then has become one of the areas most beloved residents. Fungie, a male dolphin, loves to seek out human company and enjoys playing with swimmers, surfers, ers and kayakers when they take to the sea. Since he first appeared  years ago, Fungie has been draw for tourists from across Ireland and abroad with dolphin spotting boat trips regularly taking people out to meet the playful dolphin. But then, several weeks ago, when Fungie, who was an adult when he arrived in Dingle Bay, wasnapost seen for a few days and the locals began to worry. Their concerns have now turned to heartbreak as no sign of the friendly dolphin has been seen since. In the days following Fungieaposs initial disappearance a huge search was launched using sonar scanning and scuba ers. But as hope began to fade that the dolphin would , this has now been stood down. Jimmy Flannery, the founder and owner of Dingle Sea Seafari tours, says searchers are “drained – mentally and physically.  He told the Irish Mirror : People have to realise and respect this is a friend thataposs gone missing. It’s not an object.”Jimmyaposs bond with the dolphin is so strong that when his we, who was born in Donegal, moved to Dingle the first thing he did was take her to meet Fungie. He said: He’s pulled me through thick and thin. Iaposve spent times with him when I needed just some company, and not human company. Iaposve spent it with him. I was only  years old when Fungie arrived, and Iaposm taking people out since I was  years old.  Heaposs an institution. He was the mascot, he was the sentinel at the entrance to the harbour that would meet and greet every boat no matter what. Nuala Moore, an extreme swimmer who would often meet Fungie on her regular sea swims, added: Weaposre all feeling really sad. Weaposve been sharing this body of water for  years. I grew up swimming with him. But whataposs happened to the beloved dolphin  Fungie was an adult dolphin when he first appeared in the bay and is though to be in his early to mid-s. In the wild, dolphins has a le expectancy of around  and Dr Kevin Flannery, a marine biologist in the local area, says time could simply have run out for Fungie. He explained: I would say that at this stage, because he hasnapost ed, weaposre looking at the age profile. Basically what happens to old dolphins at that stage is that theyaposre unable to catch their own food and with his age profile, he has possibly died of starvation. However, old age is not the only possible cause for Fungieaposs mysterious disappearance - the could be happier outcomes. Fungie could have left the bay because of large numbers of other dolphins in the local area. He could also have been chasing sprat, which are dolphins favourite food, further out to sea. And in the happiest outcome - Fungie, who has been alone ever since he arrived off the coast of Dingle, could have eloped with a partner.  Tragically, itaposs also possible the loveable dolphin has died of starvation. Dr Flannery said: A wild animal that has to catch his own fish for  or  years, he would be slowing down, like we all do coming up to that age. “And trying to catch fish wonapost be as easy, so the possibility of starvation comes into play – that he could have died of hunger or something like that. And while locals are heartbroken at the loss of their friend from the sea, Fungieaposs disappearance will also have a devastating impact on the townaposs economy.

Investigators want to head back to Praia de Luz, where the British three-year-old was snatched on a family holiday thirteen years ago. A source working on the case said detectives are desperate to head to the Algarve to find fresh leads on prime suspect, Christian Brueckner, after aposhitting a wallapos in recent weeks. The -year-old, who has child pornography and rape convictions, is currently serving a drugs jail term in Germany. He lived near the Praia da Luz resort where the British toddler vanished in . Brueckner’s lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher says his client is innocent.  Reports claimed the investigation is being scaled back ahead of the New Year due to a lack of fresh evidence. But a source close to the investigation told The Sun: “German officers believe there are areas of the investigation into [Christian B] and his time in Portugal which would benefit from having boots on the ground.“Most specically there are unanswered questions about [Christian Baposs] movements in the days and weeks after [Madeleine] vanished.   “German officers also think witnesses still living in Portugal could hold vital clues. The newspaper claims the German police officersapos desire to head to the Algarve is due to a breakdown in relations with their Portuguese counterparts. According to The Sun, the two forces have dfering views on whether Brueckner was involved in Maddieaposs disappearance. The German detectives will need to generate fresh leads to gain permission to investigate in Portugal again, the newspaper reports.  The Mirror reported over the weekend that German prosecutors fear they will never bring Brueckner to court. The prosecutor leading the inquiry into Brueckner’s alleged links to Maddieaposs disappearance, Hans Christian Wolters, said there was no “forensic evidence.” Mr Wolters, who is leading the probe in Germany, added that other clues investigators had were “not enough to get an arrest warrant”.

The club has done a lot for me and I want to repay the club in the best way I can – that’s by playing well and getting clean sheets.“Everyone wants to play every week, that’s why we’re footballers. It’s what I love to do. I love to train but you don’t get that buzz from getting a win.“I hope I can stay in now, grow and progress and, hopefully, get more clean sheets.”The day started on a very positive note for Dundee with the five changes made by boss James McPake making an instant impact.As well as Ferrie, coming into the team were Danny Mullen, Jonathan Afolabi, Shaun Byrne and Declan McDaid with Hamilton, Paul McGowan and Fin Robertson dropping to the bench.McDaid played his part early on, sending in a cross which found its way to Jordan Marshall with the left-back picking out Afolabi eight yards out to smash home his first goal for the club since signing from Celtic on loan.Afolabi would go close again while centre-back Lee Ashcroft had a fierce volley blocked in front of goal as the Dark Blues went searching for a second goal.David Hopkin’s Morton, though, grew into the game with their pressing continually forcing the home side back towards their own goal.I felt like as a team we dealt with the pressure well, limited their chances to just a couple of shots which were relatively easy saves at the end of the day.Dundee were still a threat but Ton had the better opportunities in the second half with a Markus Fjortoft header going just wide and an Aidan Nesbitt effort in stoppage time stopped by Ferrie.The young goalie, though, stood up to everything thrown his way by the Greenock side as he earned his first-ever shutout in Dundee colours.“It was a good way personally to start the season but a clean sheet isn’t just me, it’s the defence, midfield and strikers all working as a unit,” he said.“We saw that against Morton and had to deal with a lot of pressure, even when they went down to  men.“I felt like as a team we dealt with the pressure well, limited their chances to just a couple of shots which were relatively easy saves at the end of the day.“That’s what you want, a clean sheet, three points and let’s kick on now.”Ferrie may have taken Hamilton’s spot in the team but the Englishman revealed he’s had nothing but support from his fellow keeper after finding out he was in the team.“I found out on Friday and, personally, I’m very happy to be involved,” Ferrie said.“I’ve worked hard for it so, hopefully, I can kick on now.“Me, Jack, the young goalie Harry , and Bobby Geddes all work together as a unit and in training push each other to get better. That’s what you need.“Everyone knows about the goalkeeper’s union and we do look out for one another, want each other to do well.“We push each other in training every day.”He added: “The result against Hearts was dficult but as a team we just need to move on from it.“There are still another  games to go so it’s a long season and, at the end of the day, a - is only worth three points, same as a - is worth three points.“Now we just have to build momentum and that winning mentality throughout the squad.“You can build on clean sheets and then you only need one goal to win the game.“I think it’s about getting momentum and building on that result, taking that winning feeling into next week’s game.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretkQdjLrfQ\" data-secret\"kQdjLrfQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

You saw a team that was organised, wanted to play football and the back five were dferent class from set-plays. We dealt with everything they had.“When we went down to  men, you couldn’t tell which team had  men.“We should have scored, Gary Oliver and Nesbitt when they came on and Markus Fjortoft has a free header and should score.“I thought we looked the better team, we looked fitter, we looked organised and caused Dundee problems.“I’m devastated we got beat because I don’t think we even deserved a draw, I think we deserved three points.“Dundee looked out on their feet at the end andwe had got one I think we’d have gone on to win the game.”Chasing an equaliser, Morton’s cause wasn’t helped by former Dundee United forward Robbie Muirhead picking up two yellow cards within seconds for continued dissent.Hopkin, though, wasn’t happy with the reaction from Dundee players and staff.“It was poor,” he added.“It was a throw-in to us with the linesman two yards away but Robbie shouldn’t react.“You’ve got players and coaching staff from Dundee shouting for a second yellow which I thought was really poor. It’s a situation where I wouldn’t do that to any other club so I don’t see why they did it to our player.“It makes the referee take the decision to send Robbie off.”Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss\" title\"#Caniggia: The exciting new documentary Dundee FC fans won#t want to miss# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier caniggia embed # secretQALJbdio\" data-secret\"QALJbdio\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest vw, px\"   blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We have the power to change this, to protect the Earth and ourselves.#And we can start right now, simply by changing the way we eat. All power to the vegan pie.#Kate Fowler, director of communications at Million Dollar Vegan, said: “What we choose to buy and eat has profound consequences that go way beyond our taste buds and waistlines.#It affects both our short-term and long-term health, the health of our landscapes, how long we will have workable antibiotics, when another pandemic will come and whether we will be able to slow down climate change.#These are the biggest issues we face, but we are not helpless. We can each play a part in protecting ourselves, our planet and our future.”Rebecca Knowles, founder of Vegan Outreach Scotland said: “A global sht from current diets to diets that exclude animal products would reduce food’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to  per cent and food’s land use by  per cent.#Meat from cows and sheep has up to  times the environmental impact as plant-based foods.#In Scotland, rewilding the land formerly used to graze these animals would offset the equivalent of . years of Scottish CO emissions!

I#m afraid that wouldn#t be a viable number at Balmoral.#Councillor Peter Argyle, who represents Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside, said: #Obviously it#s disappointing but I can understand why the decision has been made.#Run Balmoral is just another victim of this dreadful pandemic and it is a real shame.#Councillor Geva Blackett, who represents Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside, said: #So much planning goes into these events so it is disappointing that the event has had to be cancelled because the virus is not under control.#It is sad for the area but it is probably better to make the decision now and people#s health has to come first.#The  Run Balmoral event is scheduled to take place from April  to April .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Some are sharing with parents or siblings, or in some cases, simply sleeping on the floor.Sainsbury’s Furniture Store will be providing the furniture at cost price and supplying a free delivery and set-up service for each one purchased.This week marks the final days of the appeal, and AberNecessities is urging people to give generously to help the organisation meet its £, target.So far, the charity has raised £, for youngsters in need and their families.Danielle Flecher-Horn, co-founder of AberNecessities, said: #We have seen the most phenomenal response and generous support for our Sweet Dreams campaign, for which we’re incredibly grateful.#We set ourselves an ambitious goal of £, and I cannot put into words how happy we are to have nearly reached this target.#This simply could not have happened without the selflessness and kindness of those who donated.#Thanks to the people in this city we’ll be able to provide not only a new bed but a happy memory for a little person who has been experiencing hardship.##As a result of the appeal, we#ll be able to provide more than  beds complete with our #Snug as a Bug# bundle which includes new pyjamas, slippers, a dressing gown, a bedtime story, hot water bottle and teddy bear.#For every £ over the target that is another bed bought for another child#s night of sweet dreams.#In May, AberNecessities was awarded £, from the Lord Provost’s Charitable Trust Aberdeen Covid- Hardship Fund.The money enabled the charity to provide more local families with essentials to care for their babies and children throughout the pandemic.Locals, businesses and supporters can donate directly to the AberNecessities #No Child Should Go Without Sweet Dreams’ appeal through the JustGiving page at https:bit.ly hyovjGFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

This will grow as more benefits are introduced and demand increases.Locations have been identied based on feedback from experience  and through working alongside community partners including the voluntary sector. This will help to identy venues that are easily accessed and many of our clients already make use of.Social security secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said it is important to make sure people in need of benefits know how to access them.She said: “Making sure that people are able to apply for benefits in the way that is right for them is one of the absolute fundamentals to ensuring that everyone gets the money that they are entitled to.“The world is changing and things like the ongoing pandemic are changing the way people access services, with more and more of us looking to do so online. However, we don’t want a service that only works for the majority, it needs to work for everyone. We need to make sure that no one is left behind.“This is why we are designing a system that gives people choices and makes sure that we take into consideration dferent accessibility needs – particularly for those looking to apply for disability assistance.“People will have a range of ways in which they can apply for the disability benefits we will introduce. This includes applying online and also the option to apply in person with one of our specially trained staff located in communities in every council area.“In setting up this service, we are taking a truly tailored approach. We want to understand the unique needs of local communities. We will continue to work with others to gain this understanding and to make sure that we have people available in the right places and at the right times across Aberdeen City.”Social Security Scotland is in charge of managing devolved benefits and it is headquartered in Dundee.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

There was another practice match and he looked far more like himself.“I felt he could be ready for the Celtic game– not to start, but to give us something from the bench.“We have another practice match and there will be more boys more ready for Sunday such as Sam, Greg Leigh, Matty Kennedy and Curtis Main.“They are coming back from injury, so we will have more options for Sunday.“We will be feeling even more ready for the semi-final with players coming back and after another week’s work and practice match.”Midfielder Dylan McGeouch is a doubt for the semi having suffered a groin strain in the draw with Celtic. Marley Watkins and Ryan Edmondson also came off injured, but McInnes is hopeful both will be okay for Sunday.McInnes said: “The players deserve a lot of credit for never giving up and getting something from the game.“I felt the semi-final was a game we could win prior to the league match.“I believe that even more so now.”ANALYSIS: Scott Wright#s superb  minutes for Aberdeen against Celtic in numbers\" title\"#ANALYSIS: Scott Wright#s superb  minutes for Aberdeen against Celtic in numbers# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews analysis-scott-wrights-superb--minutes-for-aberdeen-against-celtic-in-numbers embed # secretNSuGnMJPP\" data-secret\"NSuGnMJPP\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

We played Airdrie last week and I don#t think he had one save to make outside the penalty and the headed goal.#He had a really good save against Cove down to his right-hand side and then in the second half he#s tipped the two free-kicks over the bar.#He#s a wee bit untested # he needs to learn how to kick here, which is big for a goalie, learning how to kick at Peterhead.#But for a young goalie, you can see the stature of him and he just needs to play for a wee while. I think he#s got an agent who#s looking to take him all over Britain to bigger clubs but he just needs to play and learn his trade here.#For his age he looks like a proper goalkeeper. He#s confident that#s for sure. He#s quiet but confident.#With the departure of Greg Fleming for Stranraer in the summer, Rae has been in competition with Lenny Wilson for the starting spot.Wilson was brought in by McInally last summer as understudy to Fleming, after he ed from playing football in America.Both have been learning under new goalkeeping coach Jim Butter since pre-season, after he replaced the long-serving Scott Tait following his retirement for family reasons.McInally added: #Jim has been here for a wee while now and I think he#s enjoying the fact we#ve got two younger goalies.#Josh had two saves from free-kicks and at -year-old, he#s a decent goalkeeper. Him and Lennywill fight for the jersey and Jim is a good man to have in charge of them as he#s a workhorse.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Volunteer helpers including Patrick Gibb from Strachur, Martyn and Robin Webster, Terry Muirhead-Smith and Derek Anstee of Inveraray.Early October is expected to see a big event – the -foot hull finally turned right way up, marking the half-way point in its construction.The wooden sections came largely pre-cut and shaped by Jordan Boats of Somerset, ready to be assembled locally around a #hog# template using woodworking tools and an epoxy binder. With the main build phase over, she next requires seats and gunwales, not to mention a paint job and a set of oars.When complete the skf will likely be launched at Strachur. It is to be crewed by a team of four rowers and a coxswain.The boat will be named #Mrs McPhun# after the Strachur woman who thought she was widowed by the hanging of her husband Archie McPhun for murder at Inveraray. As Mrs McPhun, their child and the body were being rowed back to Strachur for burial, Archie’s ‘corpse’ groaned, and he was resuscitated. He lived on for some years, albeit with a crooked neck!In recognition of the expected funeral that happily never happened, the skf will be painted black.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club was set up in Inveraray two years ago with the aim of building and operating a St Ayles skf on the upper reaches of the loch.The club is a member of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association , which encourages boat building, rowing and racing of coastal rowing boats around the Scottish Coastline. Most follow the design of the St Ayles skf, which emerged in Anstruther based on the traditional Fair Isle skf, and the Scottish community rowing regattas that were traditionally popular.The kit-built boat greatly reduces the cost to a community and, as they are a standard design, they can be fairly raced in rowing against one another. It quickly became a remarkable success, attracting worldwide attention and creating its own boating class association, St Ayles Skf International . There are now over  St Ayles skfs operating around Scotland’s coast and abroad, including over a dozen in Argyll and others in the Netherlands, USA and Australia.The SCRA now has over  member clubs around the Scottish Coast and on large freshwater lochs.The Upper Loch Fyne Coastal Rowing Club, which aims to promote community spirit, learning and purposeful activity for young and old, is open to new members – to help maintain the boat, and potential rowers and navigators keen to learn nautical skills.For further information about the rowing club please contact Martyn Webster at martyn@martynwebster .For club membership or purchasing a share in the boat please contact Terry Muirhead-Smith at terrymuirheadsmith@hotmail .PICS:. no-a_LochFyneSkfNeil Wilson at work on the keel, watched by Robin Webster. no-a_LochFyneSkf. no-a_LochFyneSkf"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor october 2 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSirThe fiasco that is the A   Rest and be Thankful is an apt metaphor for the ineptitude of the Scottish government and its handling of issues as erse as transport, the economy, education and health matters.R Finlay, ArdrishaigSir,With regard to your interesting article on routes into Argyll proposed by transport Scotland I see no mention of a tunnel. Surely the simplest solution would be a tunnel from Arrochar to Butterbridge, or from Ardgarten to Butterbridge. From Arrochar may be better as the route is more of a straight line.As a former resident of Tarbert now living in Taynuilt I now live less than  miles from a tunnel into and below a hillside at Loch Awe, Ben Cruachan. I refer of course to the tunnel constructed in  with less sophisticated tools than available now.I have also seen an article on the building of tunnels for carrying water from Loch Katrine to Glasgow, much earlier than , again using more primitive equipment. In addition to those tunnels look at the construction of the railways during the railway early years. There are examples of tunnelling all over the world where knowledge could be given to the Scottish government.Cost should not be an issue, as it seems none is being spared at present to no avail.Dugald McDougall, TaynuiltSir,Many years ago I suggested, to an MP, option seven in the list of options being considered in the list released by the Scottish Government.I also pointed out that the bridging of the Loch Fyne narrows at Port Ann could be used to generate hydro power by incorporating hydro tunnels at the base of the crossing and thus provide income to alleviate costs, while the same time reducing travels costs for commercial and private users and consequently help the environment by reducing pollution.I received favourable opinion from a prominent firm of civil engineers and a #like# from a government official. To give that person credit, however, there were very many more pressing problems.I also note that the simplest idea I have since offered – that of a tunnel through the saddle to connect the ends of the existing military roads below and on each side of the Rest and thereafter, upgrading the old military road to A road standard is not even considered.This begs the question why is  Government in such a mountainous region of Scotland so averse to tunnels In the time since I made such suggestions, more than enough money has been drained away in making repairs.Capt Jim Currie, former Tarbert harbour masterScotland has around , older military veterans and Age Scotland believes that many go without the assistance available to them, such as priority healthcare for conditions linked to their service, help with dental and eye care, housing and financial support.We have launched a revamped version of our popular free #Veterans# Guide to Later Le in Scotland#.The guide features information about support and opportunities available to every older person in Scotland, plus content specically for British Armed Forces veterans including regulars, reservists, National Servicemen and merchant navy who have sailed in support of a British military operation.It is most relevant to veterans aged  plus, but much of the content will be of interest to veterans aged -, regardless of how long ago, or for how long they served.If you are aged  or older, live in Scotland and have served in the armed forces, the guide will be most relevant to you. It doesn’t matter how long ago, or for how long, you served: you may have had a military career, a short period of national service, been a reservist, or even supported a military operation with the merchant navy.Many people we’ve met through our Veterans’ Project left the armed forces with little or no support for readjusting to civilian le. Today, the military is more proactive in supporting that transition, but older veterans it seems were, by and large, left to it.Our guide aims to ensure veterans have a better experience when making the transition to later le.Veterans and their families can request a free paper guide by calling Age Scotland on     or visiting www.age.scot veteransguide.

If we are indeed correct in this assumption, then this is a very disingenuous process by Transport Scotland, for it is not a consultation in the true sense of the word.There is no doubt that the need to address the A crisis of connectivity is an urgent one.

That ambition must be tempered with a degree of realism – Argyll and Bute needs a solution to be delivered as soon as possible and the delivery timeline is a key issue in considering all the options.#That is why the council supports option one as offering realistic solutions which will increase resilience on the A and provide the uninterrupted year-round access that Argyll and Bute needs and deserves.#This route corridor appears, on the face of it, to offer the most deliverable set of solutions within an option, although these remain engineering projects of considerable signicance and which will be complex to progress.#Six of the other  options will not be supported by the council, while options two to five are not ruled outthey can be delivered sustainably.Of those, the council rates option five as its preference. The route would make use of existing roads while new crossings would be built over Loch Long between Whistlefield and Barnacabber, and Loch Fyne between Otter Ferry and Port Ann.Option two goes through Glen Kinglas, option three through Glen Fyne, and option four starts the same as option five from Arden, but moves north from Barnacabber to Cairndow.On those four options, the council said: #These ambitious proposals have signicant transformative potential for Argyll and Bute, increasing resilience as well as enhancing connectivity to, from and for all of Argyll and Bute, including opening up more direct connections to the central belt for communities like Mid Argyll and Kintyre.#If any of these options can be delivered or substantially progressed within an acceptable timeframe, then the council will support them.##The opportunities arising from more direct access to and from the central belt could be truly transformational.

The financial help we are making available will enable outlets to make this signicant positive step.#There is an understanding among communities about the damage done by single-use packaging as they see the effects in the countryside, beaches and seas around them.#As well as reducing waste, by opting for reuse we also reduce our carbon footprint by eliminating the need to extract, transport and manufacture materials to make new products.#The scheme is part of a larger £ million programme designed to inspire locally-led green projects as part of the recovery from the Covid- pandemic.Across Scotland, around kg of packaging per household generates an estimated , tonnes of global production emissions per year. Single-use grocery packaging also creates litter.Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: #The Islands Green Recovery Programme will stimulate new economic activity across our islands – helping to create a sustainable green economy.#We are aware that mitigating the effects of climate change can be more expensive for those living on our islands, which is why we are delighted to announce this funding.#This investment with Zero Waste Scotland is available to small and medium enterprises – who wish to offer customers a packaging-free shopping experience, where they are encouraged to use their own re-useable containers to purchase a range of foods and household groceries.#Applications for funding are open until pm on November  .

The original £, awarded for improvements related to town centres was topped up by a further £, funding. There was also an additional £, to improve walking and wheeling access to schools.After fully analysing responses from the consultation, local area committees have agreed to go ahead with a number of projects across the authority area.According to the council, the consultation identied that Campbeltown#s town centre already has sufficient space for physical distancing and maintaining all existing car parking spaces was seen as a priority.Instead, work will focus on providing a cycleway and improved pavements on the section of Ralston Road between Campbeltown Hospital and Campbeltown Grammar School which is bounded by playing fields and therefore will not require any space to be taken from the existing road.The council is also looking at the Esplanade to confirma segregated cycleway can be accommodated without losing any existing on-street parking.Councillor Colville said: #I believe the analysis and participation in the consultation was excellent, the results from which, when linked to the new Traffic Regulation Order now in operation, will greatly improve access to town centre shopping.#I would also thank officers in gaining funding to improve social distancing on the narrow pavements leading to the Grammar school, something both myself and Councillor Armour were keen to achieve.#Councillor Armour added: #The result of the consultation is exactly what I was hearing from local businesses and the public, that there was enough space in the middle of the town to social distance.#I think the idea of a cycleway and improved pavements between the hospital entrance and the school bus turning area is an excellent idea and something Councillor Colville and myself pushed hard for during the consultation.#The pavement in that area is far too narrow when pupils are coming and going from school so opening up the area and including a safe cycleway should allow a safe distance for those walking on the pavement and a new option with the cycleway.#However, Councillor Kelly said: #Every grant and tranche of funding must be used to gain maximum benefit for the community. I would rather see this funding utilised in the town centre and surrounding area to make much-needed improvements to the pavements including installing drop kerbs to improve disabled access.

Its constables included several Lauders of the Bass. Their writ ran south of the Tweed to include Ancroft, Kyloe, Norham, Belford, Elwick and Tweedmouth, as well as present-day Berwickshire.At a time when the sea was the highway for commerce in heavy goods, South Berwickbecame the richest city in the land, thriving on trade with the Low Counties and Hanseatic Ports in timber, wool and produce from the Merse.English kings coveted its strategic location. While the English were embroiled where, Berwick blossomed. At other times, Berwick changed hands  times until, in , it fell to Richard III. Elizabeth I secured it with massive fortications, which survive intact.With the Union, most of its hinterland stayed in Scotland. For five centuries, this made scant dference beyond legal issues. However, re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament created disparities ndash in free personal care, prescriptions, tuition fees, etc.Resentment at this in Berwick itself was compounded when Berwick District Council was abolished and the town became a remote appendage to Northumberland.The northward bulge of the border between the Cheviots and the sea remains a defensive throwback. This modern anomaly of Berwick and the disparity between its residents and those in its hinterland could be resolved by a plebiscite among the , residents to decidethe border should be shted south from Lamberton Toll to around Lindisfarne, ing the town and southern villages to Berwickshire.Satisfactory as this might be to locals, Westminster is likely to block such a move. This sht of border would reassert Scottish jurisdiction over the same , square miles of North Sea that Tony Blair allocated to England on the quiet  years ago.

The important role of plants in reducing pollution is now so widely recognised that many nations are actively promoting large-scale planting of trees.Whilst most of us would be upset to think that there might be poor air quality in our homes, the reality is that common airborne pollutants such as CO, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds and phthalates from new materials and furnishings are quite normal, and that is exacerbated where the building, furnishings and decoration are new.Working from home offers an opportunity to optimise the air quality in which we work and live, ensuring best conditions. Although therersquos no substitute for opening the window and circulating the air, we live in Scotland and sometimes thatrsquos simply not possible! Cue houseplants to help improve the air quality, reduce noise pollution and generally create a more relaxed, natural environment.Our top  indoor plants:. Chlorophytum Possibly our best-selling indoor plant, this green and white iegated plant is very simple to care for.With research showing that the spider plant is capable of removing up to  per cent of household air-borne toxins in just two days, itrsquos easy to see why itrsquos a customer favourite.The graceful arching habit of the spider plant makes it suitable as either a hanging plant or in a pot on the desk.One interesting feature of the spider plant is that it produces little lsquoplantletsrsquo on stems which can be easily rooted to create a new plant.. Spathiphyllum The peace lily is also a very easy plant to care for, and very attractive with glossy green leaves and pure white flowers. It is an excellent air purier and is particularly good at removing mould spores and household vapours such as benzene, ammonia and acetone.Depending on the iety, the peace lily can range in height from around cm to over one metre.The peace lily is happy in medium to low light levels, making it ideal for the home office. Attractive purely as a foliage plant, yoursquoll encourage more flowering with better light.The peace lily is unlikely to need watering every day and itrsquos best to take your cue from the plant itself. If the leaves begin to droop, itrsquos usually a sign that it needs some water, but be careful and check that itrsquos not because you have over-watered ndash being too generous with water is one of the most common reasons for these plants to fail!. Ficus benjamina Many plants ndash both indoors and outdoors ndash can be useful in reducing noise pollution. So,your home office is in the corner of a room thatrsquos used by other family members, plants with lots of foliage can be a useful way to create an aesthetic room ider and separate noise.There are many weeping fig ieties available, offering a choice of dferent shades of green or iegated silver green or gold green foliage.Weeping figs thrive in areas where there is good light andlight is only available from one direction, growth will be primarily on the light-facing side. Thatrsquos finethe plant is only seen from one side, for exampleitrsquos against a wall, but for all-round foliage, yoursquoll need to rotate the plant occasionally.As with most houseplants, water when the compost is dry to the touch and take care not to over-water.. Monstera One of the most easily recognised indoor plants with an upright habit and large glossy leaves with cuts and holes , itrsquos native to the South American rainforests and it is understood that the leaves have naturally developed these holes and cuts to help the plantrsquos large leaves avoid damage in tropical storms.In the home, it is often grown on a moss pole to provide an anchor for the aerial rootswhich fix into the pole for stability as the plant grows taller.This plant doesnrsquot need a great deal of attention water when the compost becomes dry, and place it in a bright room but preferably not in direct sunlight, and mist the leavesthe humidity seems low.. Sansevieria All Sansevieria are incredibly tough and, for those who believe that they canrsquot keep plants, this is definitely the plant that should change their thinking!There are many dferent ieties of Sansevieria, with dferent common names including the mother-in-lawrsquos tongue because of its sharpness, or the snake plant because of its mottled foliage.These striking plants have upright, rigid leaves which can be flat or cylindrical, green, iegated or even striped depending on iety. With their simple, bold, architectural structure, they are almost sculptural in appearance and requiring minimal attention, theyrsquore tolerant of even the least green-fingered.Of course, these are only a few of the many dferent indoor plants we have in the garden centre where our staff are always happy to give you help and advice on the best plants for your home office.

Why does he think people are often scared when it comes to the baking staple \"One of the biggest issues people have, I think, is not controlling temperatures. Its that thing of when you try to make a pie on a summers day and its super hot in the kitchen and the pastrys melting, the butters splitting out of it, its hard to make it look pretty...\"That in itself is enough to put someone off doing pastry again, I think - that or getting a Wellington wrong and youve got the whole family sat around the table and you cut it and it doesnt look nice, the beefs overcooked...

Strange Timez combines a myriad of genres, sounds and styles with a formidable selection of guest artists, producing an album that has something for everyone.We get pulsing, reverb-heavy beats on Pac-Man , punchy, frantic rock drumming on Momentary Blissand even a melancholic power ballad in The Pink Phantom .The distinctive croon of mastermind Damon Albarn comes through sporadically but only to complement the scores of big-hitting guest artists - from Robert Smith to Skepta - who each bring a dferent vibe and personality to their track.Unlike previous albums Demon Days and Plastic Beach there is no single theme or sound to Song Machine, which might not be to everyones taste but is sure to appeal to those who like a bit of everything.Review by Michael BediganRUSSELL WATSON -

The Labour Government at the end of the Second World War could have decided not to have nuclear weapons. It initially took the option to have them largely because of status and pride. Ernest Bevin, then the Foreign Secretary, stated: \"Wersquove got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.\" The costs of maintaining that status have become more and more expensive over the years, which has led to the UK becoming more and more reliant upon the US for technical support at a cost. The theory must be that it is better to have a nuclear deterrent sort of independent rather than not have such deterrent at all.I also believe that status still has a large part to play in the UKrsquos position today, albeit we are far removed from the circumstances prevailing at the end of the Second World War. It is interesting that all five permanent members of the UN Security Council are nuclear powers: China, France, Russia, the UK and the US. The UK, no doubt, places great value upon that status and is likely to regard being a nuclear power as helping to sustain it. The original idea was that the five would progressively disarm in exchange for other states not acquiring nuclear weapon facilities. That idea has gone well, hasnrsquot it  Look at India and Pakistan and the likelihood of some others.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.SEAPLANES AT LARGEI WAS surprised that no mention was made, in the article about the stranded seaplane in Loch Ness , of the  Catalina seaplanes based in Largs during the Second World War.

On the face of it this sounds quite reasonable, but as I see it there is one fundamental flaw.The idea which is being advanced by scientists is that the four nations would sit down together and come up with a plan which would be arrived at after due consultation and negotiation. It is here that the idea collapses. The four nations are not at the table on an equal basis. One of those nations, England as represented by the Tory Government, holds both the numerical advantage and the purse strings. It already has form particularly in the north of the country, of advancing the notion of negotiation when in fact what it is doing is to use the screen of democracy as a means of imposing its will. We must always remember that the chief advisor to Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet, Dominic Cumming, cares not a jot about democracy, only about achieving his aims.In a four-nation approach therefore there would be a plan put forward which in essence would be telling three of the nations what the fourth and biggest has decided. This would mean in Scotland that the First Minister would no longer carry the responsibility and accountability for addressing the fight against the pandemic.I appreciate, particularly in the hospitality industry there are problems in Scotland. But are we saying that we would really want Mr Johnson to set the agenda. You only have to look at the polls in England on his handling of the virus to realise that any misgivings we may have in Scotland are magnied -fold down south.If I thought for a moment that a four-nation approach was what the name suggests was possible I might consider it. However, in reality what a four-nation approach would be is one nation setting the rules for the other three.George Kay, Burntisland.YOUR front page lead article on Fridaycontains a paragraph, that,correct, means the First Minister should forthwith resign as it clear that she has become unfit to hold office.Legal challenges do not undermine public health: they serve to test whether decisions by her and her Government or by local authorities made under legislation are lawful. To exclude or discourage recourse to the courts is to undermine the rule of law. The rule of law is fundamental to democracy.To state that legal challenges ldquomakes future flexibilities less likely to be granted is the threat of a dictator and many have come to the view that the actions of her Government since  demonstrate that it is, in effect, totalitarian.

Like many other villages we have lost our amenities through industrial declineand changes in social habits. Governments all over Europe have closed down the licensed hospitality industry as the dangers of enclosed spaces combined with an alcohol-induced loss of inhibition, lead to increased risk of catching spreading a deadly virus.The hospitality industry is to take the Scottish Government to court to attempt to re-open their facilities in one way or another . While I have great sympathy for their plight, I cannot help but wonder:they win their case, do they then become liable in law for any subsequent health issue their customers suffer, after opening against the specic advice of health authorities GR Weir, Ochiltree.GIVEN that the second outbreak of Covid- was entirely predictable as soon as schools and universities went back after the summer, I make another prediction.Christmas could bring a huge spike in cases, particularly with students ing to their homes.

Itrsquos a task I enjoy, a sort of horticultural hoovering although, unlike some, we donrsquot have a leaf blower. I prefer the swish of the rake and gathering armfuls, along with windfall apples nibbled by birds and mice.Irsquove always loved late autumn, but its arrival is less welcome than usual. Most poetry, as in Keatsrsquo famous ode, glories in the abundance of colour and atmosphere, although WH Auden is as miserablist as they come in Autumn Song. More appropriate this year, to my mind, is Louis MacNeicersquos Autumn Journal, which I spent a rainy afternoon reading. Previously Irsquod only known a few lines, often read aloud by my husband, who knows parts of it by heart: ldquoAnd August going out to the tin trumpets of nasturtiums And the sunflowersrsquo Salvation Army blare of brass. The whole work is an immersion in desperate times in Europe, as observed by a man too young to offer much hope.Autumn Journal was written as the summer of  turned to winter, during which the Munich Agreement was settled, and the Spanish Civil War began stuttering to its end. MacNeice was in London and his evocations of the city and his own affairs over the months to New Year are vivid and sombre. For all its picaresque observations, this is a profound, plangent and foreboding piece of work. While he wrote, he could not have known that one year later the country, and much of the world, would be at war. Nevertheless, intimations of menace underlie its mood. Many of its lines could have been written for our present predicament, not just Covid but also Brexit: ldquoConferences, adjournments, ultimatums, Flights in the air, castles in the air The autopsy of treaties, dynamite under the bridges, The end of laissez faire.In MacNeicersquos epic poem, as today, autumn reaches into the heart of every city but in the countryside it is all-pervasive, and offers a misleading sense of normality. Tractors rattle past, their trailers heaped with potatoes so pungent you can smell them from a distance. On the main road out of the village earlier in the week an escaped bull, a Belted Galloway, created a logjam. Grazing by the roadside, he could not be budged. It was two hours before he could be coaxed back into his field and traffic could get by once again. I see he had been put into solitary confinement, well away from the heers and calves.Meanwhile, gardens are being put to bed or, in our case, allowed to stay up a little too late, as we catch up on a backlog of muddy duties, among them planting bulbs. This involves the almost industrial-scale removal of stones as, inch by inch, we reclaim the garden from its subcutaneous layer of rubble. As I was in the process of doing this, half the village seemed to pass and pause for a chat. It was a heart-warming glimmer of the old days, when people would often meet up for coffee, or gin, and jamboree in the village hall. With falling temperatures and heavy rain, all of that has fallen into abeyance and the lack is sorely felt.With Hallowersquoen approaching, carved pumpkins are beginning to appear on windowsills. They are the embodiment of autumn, night-time suns that banish the gloom and merrily brighten the darkening evenings. As I was thinking of carving one of my own for the doorstep, I found YouTube filled with the most gruesome examples, which turn fun into horror as big pumpkins crunch screaming baby pumpkins, or have their heads split open, allowing their seedy ldquobrains to spill out. I know this is the season of ghouls, but Irsquoll be putting a smiley face on mine.Listening to the news, itrsquos hard to believe that the crisis looming over us will one day be history. MacNeice was living in far graver times than ours and, while the present predicament is deeply worrying, his era puts ours in perspective. ldquoSleep to the noise of running water Tomorrow to be crossed, however deep  This is no river of the dead or Lethe,  To-night we sleep On the banks of Rubicon ndash the die is cast There will be time to audit The accounts later, there will be sunlight later And the equation will come out at last.He was, of course, right. Just as Derek Mahon, who died at the start of this month, was right when he wrote his popular poem, Everything Is Going To Be All Right. This injunction to optimism, written  years ago when he was very ill, was often quoted as the pandemic took hold: ldquoThere will be dying, there will be dying,  but there is no need to go into that.Like MacNeice, Mahon calls on the sun for solace. ldquoThe sun rises in spite of everything, he writes. As I type, the late morning sun comes and goes.

Therersquos been an understandable furore over the Tory MPs who questioned the idea of funding free school meals over the holidays in England, but it seems to me that, among supporters of the coronavirus restrictions, therersquos been a distinct lack of furore over the effects that the rules are having on the low-paid. In fact, most of us seem to be willingly participating in the effects, promoting them, and enforcing them.The experiences of some of the people Irsquove encountered in the last few days should help explain what I mean. People like Sarah, whorsquos  years old and has two jobs: cleaning in a caravan site and working in a bar two nights a week. Or Sarahrsquos mother, who also works as a cleaner. I spoke to Sarah towards the end of one of her shts in the bar and she was knackered and stressed, not least because shersquod had to do the whole sht while wearing a mask.But it gets worse. The second job Sarah does cleaning caravans has become much more onerous and time-consuming in recent weeks because the cleaning has to be more thorough because of the virus, so jobs that were taking  minutes are now taking half an hour and so on. The problem is that Sarah is earning the same money but the job has become much harder. The experience of Sarahrsquos mother is similar: her work is much harder than it was and at the end of her sht shersquos tired and frustrated because of the PPE shersquos required to wear.Sarahrsquos attitude to all of this is pretty clear. Her le, and that of her motherrsquos, have become much more dficult and stressful in the last few months and shersquos worried about her income and her future. Shersquos been told her cleaning job at the caravan site is unlikely to continue beyond January and she has to wear a mask for most of her working day. But Sarah is . Her mother is in her s. Their risk of death from the virus is small and hundreds of times lower than it would bethey were in their s or s. In fact, Sarah suspects shersquos already had the virus and recovered.The consequences of not changing to such a policy are pretty grim. Sarah will probably lose her job in a few weeks, and we know there will be lots of others like her because women on low incomes are disproportionately represented in sectors that have been locked down, such as hospitality. Theyrsquore also less likely to be able to work from home so have to go out to work in low-paid jobs made more miserable by restrictions that over-emphasise the risks.So what would you say to Sarah  ldquoItrsquos a price worth paying  ldquoIt would be wrong to relax the restrictions now  The problem with phrases like that is they often come from people with the least to lose. In fact, I seem to have noticed that a personrsquos support for lockdown is often in inverse proportion to the effect itrsquos likely to have on them ndash in other words, itrsquos all very well being keen on restrictions and shutting bars and caravan parks and all the rest of it when you donrsquot have to work in them, and can work from home instead. The point is you canrsquot do Zoomyou work in a bar or clean caravans for a living.Perhaps the solution to the problem ndash a problem which disproportionately affects women ndash could be found in the wisdom of another woman. You may have seen her on TV. Maureen from Barnsley. Shersquos the octogenarian who said she didnrsquot give a sod about the new restrictions in her town and wouldnrsquot be fastened to her house, and her frustration, and her appeal to common sense, seemed to strike a chord with many of those who heard her.Maureenrsquos views on further lockdown could also offer a solution to the plight of people like Sarah. How many lockdowns can we afford, asks Maureen. The people who are going to suffer the most, she says, are our young ones, and the unemployed and what we need to do is focus the help on the elderly people and we canrsquot afford to mess about either. Itrsquos maybe not how an epidemiologist would put it, or a politician, but I like the directness of what Maureen from Barnsley says.

This is entirely about presentation. And Irsquom going to advance the controversial view that giving the impression that you relish seeing poverty-stricken children starve is what the psephologists call ldquoa bad look.Thatrsquos not to say that I think the Westminster Government should necessarily have covered the cost of free school meals over the English half-term . The Tories are not automatically useless or callous because they decided not to, andyour knee-jerk reaction is to call them ldquoscum, you might want to ask yourself why the same wouldnrsquot apply to Labour, the SNP, or any other brand of politicians, none of whom have yet introduced year-round provision for children who get free school meals. By that logic, Nye Bevan was scum, for failing to add food to healthcare as something to be nationalised and available free at the point of use.Except that all parties, to a greater or lesser extent, do advocate some such provision through the welfare system. Itrsquos a perfectly respectable position to argue that the provision is inadequate itrsquos also perfectly respectable to maintain that itrsquos flawed or counter-productive.Those are political or ideological stances. Whatrsquos criminally stupid is to fail to make any case, or make it in a way that paints you in the worst possible light. For those who argue for more spending, thatrsquos by looking like incompetent fiscal lunatics. Therersquos a reason why Jeremy Corbynrsquos version of Labour got the worst electoral result in the partyrsquos history.For those arguing against spending, itrsquos harder to be a crowd-pleaser, but it neednrsquot require you to play King Rat in Dick Whittington. This is where the Tories are failing dismally. This is a Government that has spent pound billion more than usual this year, and itrsquos letting itself be portrayed as penny-picking and heartless.Any sensible government might have weighed up how much one weekrsquos worth of meals for those already being supported would have cost, compared with the political damage it might create. Given that the footballer Marcus Rashford has been campaigning on this issue , and that it had been done previously, it was a foreseeable question.If it decided not to cough up, it could have explained its thinking in any one of a dozen presentable ways: to take just a couple, therersquos the argument that itrsquos a council matter, and additional money has been given to councils, or the case that welfare payments have been increased to cover just such costs. Telling the low-paid that they should be able to feed a family of four on pound a week, or that they should sell their iPhones, is not an approach that will tend to win you support.Douglas Ross, who had the good luck not to vote on the measure, has actually adopted a reasonably sensible position ndash political positioning, that is, not whether hersquos right or wrong ndash when the subject comes up:  I was never supposed to be in Westminster for this vote  itrsquos an English measure, anyway and  Irsquove already introduced the opposite policy for the party in Scotland. This stance isnrsquot going to make anyone who hates the Tories fall in love with him, but it doesnrsquot make voters who have no strong opinion think badly of you for entirely avoidable reasons.On this front, Rashford is much more politically canny than the professionals. He has very deliberately avoided condemnation, saying that, while hersquos disappointed, his priority is to get on with helping.The funny thing is that the Tories, of all political parties, should know exactly the presentational dangers of this sort of issue ndash actually, of this particular issue, because it has cropped up before, and it was responsible for creating a damaging political reputation then.Readers older than , or anyone who has watched any drama set in the s or s, will know that Margaret Thatcher ndash asto provide proof of her inhuman callousness and hatred of the poor ndash was a ldquomilk snatcher, who abolished free milk and school meals when she was Education Secretary. Except that she didnrsquot.In , Tony Barber, then the Chancellor, wanted to get rid of milk and free school meals altogether, but Mrs Thatcher persuaded him to retain them for poorer children she also got the money that was saved from the Budget ringfenced for other school improvements, and was actually praised by a leader infor having fended off an attack on the education budget. But when, six months later, local councils stopped providing free milk, she still got the blame.Of course, Mrs Thatcher didnrsquot see any reason why those who could afford to pay for milk or school meals shouldnrsquot be asked to, just as plenty of people donrsquot see why itrsquos suddenly the statersquos business to start providing free food in addition to the existing welfare payments. But she understood the political charge involved in the issue, the potential danger, and thevery negligible capital to be gained.She later forgot that lesson when she introduced the poll tax ndash another measure for which local councils were responsible, but where central government got the blame anyway. And look how that ended up for her. The alarming thing, in watching the current Government at Westminster, is not even whether you think theyrsquore right or wrong over any particular policy.

I set out at the end of this letter howwe propose to manage that process.We anticipate that the Deputy First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Communities Local Government will then discuss Scotlands Strategic Framework and its implementation with council leaders in calls on Tuesday  and Wednesday  October, in parallel withParliamentary debate and other discussions, before decisions are reached and implementedin the days leading to Monday  November.This is, I know, a challenging timescale in challenging times. I am grateful for the help thatyou and colleagues in COSLA and SOLACE have already given us, and will give in comingdays, as we work through it together.Scotlands Strategic FrameworkCOVID- threatens le, health, society and prosperity in Scotland. The Scottish Government is committed to suppressing the virus to the lowest possible level, and keepingit there while we strive toto a more normal le for as many people as possible. Aftersuccess in doing so over the summer, we are now experiencing high numbers of cases, anda rising challenge.Scotlands Strategic Framework, published on Friday  October, sets out a levels-based system of measures to suppress the virus, based on the \"four harms\" approach set out inour COVID- Framework for Decision-Making.The five levels are set out in the Framework. Each higher level is designed to haveprogressively stronger effects in suppressing the virus and the illness and deaths it causes, by breaking chains of transmission.Measures to suppress the virus themselves cause harm to wider health and care ,societyand the economy . Though we have designed the levels to mitigatethem as much as possible, consistent with suppressing the virus, these wider harms andeconomic impacts are stark, especially at the higher levels. We are profoundly aware of theirimpacts on people, businesses and communities across Scotland. We know, however, thatfailing to suppress the virus, while it remains a threat to public health, would do even greaterdamage, and result in the loss of many more lives.The levels complement other measures, such as promoting compliance with the FACTS guidance and use of the Protect Scotland app, Test  Protect, and self-isolation by those with symptoms and or a positive test.As with the restrictions now in place, the new levels will only be applied where that is justied, necessary and proportionate in the face of the threat of the virus running out of control, and only kept in place for so long as that remains the case. Ministers wish to work in partnership with Local Government and others to mitigate all four harms, and to monitor and respond to impacts on people, society and economic activity. I say more about this later.The effects of exponential growthThe modelling and advice available to Ministers shows that measures to suppress the virusare more effective when they are applied as soon as they are needed. This is challenging,since it means decision must be taken quickly, and often in circumstances that are volatile,uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Decisive action, however, can mean that measures canbe in place for a shorter period with a greater effect than would otherwise be necessary.Where delay lets the virus get a hold, the measures needed to get it back under control have to be more severe and in place for longer.This is because, when cases start to rise, indicated by a reproduction number or R above ,they do so exponentially, and we have seen how the numbers of new infections can doublein little more than a week. The most serious effects, including admissions to hospital andintensive care, and deaths, lag behind new infections by between two and three weeks. Thismeans it is necessary to take measures early, in order to save lives and prevent the NHSbeing overwhelmed.The approach set out in Scotlands Strategic Framework is designed to help get the right level of measures in place as quickly as possible, for the shortest necessary time, to bringthe virus under control in each part of Scotland. Success means bringing R below , andseeing case numbers drop.Intervening early is also the best way to reduce the long-term economic impact of the virus. Getting it back under control quickly avoids still more severe measures, of the kind that hadto be used from March this year, or longer periods of lesser but still damaging restrictions.Applying higher levels creates economic harm, as is painfully clear but doing so as soon asthey are needed and only until they have worked is the best way to avoid still greater harm.Measures to suppress the virus have been in place across Scotland since  October.Though it proved necessary to extend these, there are now signs justying cautiousoptimism that they are bringing the virus back under control in many parts of Scotland.Engaging Parliament, Local Government, health boards, and othersScotlandrsquos Strategic Framework sets out an approach to applying restrictions only wherenecessary, and removing them as soon as they have achieved their effect. Ministers haveset out the framework with an open mind, and have committed to engaging with Parliament,Local Government and others on its implementation.The framework itself will be debated in Parliament on Tuesday  October. In parallel,Ministers are keen to engage with Local Government before taking decisions which willaffect every community and citizen in Scotland.Ministers intend to reach final decisions later this week on both the levels set out in theframework and their application. These will be set out and implemented in regulationseffective from Monday  November, and replacing measures currently in place. Ministersintend that, from that date, each local authority area in Scotland will be placed in one of thefive levels set out in the framework.This is a rapid and challenging timescale in which to engage effectively. It is necessarybecause every day counts in suppressing the virus.There are three issues on which Ministers particularly want to engage Local Government leaders.. Reaching decisions on initial levels for local authority areas in implementing ScotlandsStrategic Framework. Understanding how levels will affect each area, and identying the areas, sectors and issues where partnership between the Scottish Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards and others can be most effective in coming weeks and for as long as the Framework remains necessary and. Gathering other comments on Scotlands Strategic Framework ahead of its implementation.While all three are important, the first is the most signicant, given the timescales. I say moreabout each below.In parallel, Ministers are also being advised by the National Incident Management Team , drawing public health expertise from Health Boards and their Directors of Public Health. Through the NIMT, Ministers have asked that Directors of Public Health support local authority Chief Executives and Leaders in their areas in responding to this request for help.Similarly, I should be gratefulChief Executives would draw on support from Directors ofPublic Health in considering this letter.Indicators and rangesScotlandrsquos Strategic Framework sets outhow Ministers propose to reach and later review decisions on initial levels for each local authority area in Scotland. These decisions are ultimately judgments for Ministers, taking account of all the facts and considerations relevant at the time they are made, in relation to the areas directly affected and for Scotland as a whole. Ministers are committed to ensuring that decisions are informedby data and analysis, and have set out the indicators they will review in reaching thesedecisions. It is our intention to keep these indicators under review and update them as, forexample, new or improved data become available or conditions change.As you know, Scottish Government analysts, working with the NIMT, expect to make available shortly a paper setting out in more detail how the indicators set out in Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework are being used to inform the levels-based approach. This will includeconsideration of how ranges can be applied to the data to signal when consideration of therelevant indicator is needed, as part of reviews of the application of levels. Decisions onlevels will, however, be judgements informed by these data and other considerations, not theresult of an algorithm. This will always be the case. I will of course share that paper withCOSLA as soon as it is available.We are also working to share data with COLSA on the social and economic structures of Local Government areas. We are drawing on these and other data to extend our ldquofour harms analysis from the whole of Scotland to inidual local authority areas. As we do so, we are committed to working closely with COSLA and SOLACE to ensure that LocalGovernment has full and transparent access to these and other data informing decisions, and to extend our ldquofour harms analysis from the whole of Scotland to inidual local authority areas so that we have a shared understanding of the effectiveness and impacts of the levels-based approach across Scotland. For that reason, COLSA and SOLACE have been invited to take part in meetings of the NIMT and of the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquoFour Harms Group of chief advisers and lead officials. I say more on this partnership approach later.. Initial levelsNo decisions have yet been made on initial levels. This is in order to allow decisions to be informed by the latest available data and public health advice. Ministers intend to set out initial levels later this week, along with a statement of reasons for these decisions, for implementation along with the levels approach from Monday  November.I hope it will be helpfulI set out the approach being taken to these decisions. The starting point is the measures currently in place. These are broadly equivalent to Level  in thecentral belt, and Level  where. Changes from these levels, whether up or down, needto be justied by the data, supported by public health advice and consistent with the ScottishGovernmentrsquos COVID- Framework for Decision-Making.Because of the severity of the impact of the measures in the highest level, Level , Ministerswill only consider using itnecessary. The data currently indicate that level of concern fortwo areas: Level  is being considered for North and South Lanarkshire. There are, however,some signs in the latest data that the situation in those areas may be stabilising. Ministerswill not reach a decision for these two areas until the latest possible point to ensure that theycan take account of the fullest possible picture of the effect of measures already in place but at this stage the use of Level  cannot be ruled out. If it was necessary, it would be used toavoid still greater harm, including many deaths.No changes are currently being considered in relation to other central belt areas. If that remains the case and is confirmed later this week, these areas would remain in Level  forthe time being. There are some signs in the data of progress in the east of the central beltarea, for example in Edinburgh and East Lothian, but some further consolidation of thatprogress is likely to be required before it would be safe, on public health grounds, to movethem to Level .The data for Dundee City also gives cause for concern, with rising numbers of cases. Again,a final decision will be made on the basis of data becoming available in the next few days.Meantime, consideration is being given to moving Dundee City to Level  in the newframework, broadly equivalent to the measures currently in place in the central belt. Furtherconsideration is also being given to the interaction between Dundee and neighbouring areas within the Tayside Health Board area.At this crucial stage in suppressing the virus, with higher case numbers, the winter approaching, and the introduction of a new strategic framework, the public health advice toMinisters is that it would not be safe to move any area straight to the lowest level, Level .There are, however, encouraging signs in the data, signaled by the indicators, in relation to some of the areas presently at Level . These are Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, andthe Western Isles. Presently, consideration is being given to moving five areas from Level to Level , with two additional safeguards. The first is maintaining ldquono in-home socialising inLevel  for a period from  November . The second is reinforcing communication of the travel advice set outin Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework in order to bear down on the risk of infection beingintroduced to these areas from areas of higher prevalence.Other areas presently at Level  would remain there on  November,the data and otherconsiderations remain unchanged in the coming few days.Scotlandrsquos Strategic Framework makes clear that the levels, once introduced, are likely toremain in place for between two and four weeks, but will be reviewed weekly ndash a process inwhich we ask COSLA and SOLACE to be involved ndash in order to ensure that restrictions onlyremain in force for so long as they are justied, necessary and proportionate. We anticipatethat the first such review will take place in the week beginning Monday  November. Any proposed movement up or down the levels will be discussed with the relevant local authorityChief Executive and Council Leaders in advance of Ministers taking decisions.. PartnershipClose partnership working and a ldquoTeam Scotland approach has never been more importantthan now. We are already drawing in this crisis on structures, co-operation and commonpurpose developed over many years of working together as Resilience partners, throughSGoRR, and through Partnership Action for Continuing Employment . In the nextphase of the response to COVID-, Ministers seek local authorities rsquoviews on how best thispartnership can be focused. Ministers have in mind, and would welcome comments on, threeareas for early partnership working:. In areas facing particular challenges and impacts, we will want to work with you to support your efforts to coordinate a whole-system effort at the local level recognizing that councils are uniquely placed to do this.. We are engaging in parallel with the hospitality sector across Scotland, including Local Government for its environmental health, economic development and otherrelevant roles, building on existing close engagement and focusing on how best toensure compliance with necessary restrictions and make hospitality settings as safeas possible, recognising the particularly severe impact on this sector resulting from anecessary focus on preventing the virus spreading in indoor environments wherepeople from dferent households come into contact with each other.. Partnership working could build on ldquofour harms analysis of the impacts of the virus across Scotland and on particular areas, communities, iniduals, and business sectors, building on the analysis summarised in the attached paper and in evidenceand assessment papers published as part of the Scotlandrsquos Route Map series. Thiswork would be rooted in our commitment to understanding and acting upon theinequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.We should welcome views from local authorities on these and other priorities for partnershipworking.. Other comments on Scotlandrsquos Strategic FrameworkMinisters have set out the framework and its five levels with an open mind, and have saidthat they will consider proposals for changes to the levels. They and officials are engaging inparallel with local government, through the process described here, with Health Boards, withbusiness interests and other stakeholders, and with Parliament, which will debate and voteon the framework on Tuesday  October. Parliament will also scrutinise regulationsimplementing the framework.Ministers will therefore also welcome the view of councils on the framework as a whole, which is intended to bring greater clarity to measures to suppress the virus, making it possible to communicate these more effectively and secure the widest possible understanding, support and compliance with them. Everyone has a part to play in suppressing the virus and by playing our part, we can help reduce the level of measures needed to keep it in check.While Ministers intend that, for clarity and consistency, the same levels definitions will be used throughout Scotland for any given period, adjustments to the definitions of levels may be made from time to time. For example, the strategic framework indicates that, in somecircumstances, indoor household socialising may be prevented even at Level  , and I have said above is under consideration andrestricted hours in hospitality settings may y from time to time .Contacts and next stepsI appreciate your help and that of SOLACE in gathering view from local authorities as rapidlyas possible.The next step in that process is that you have agreed to forward this letter to every local authority chief executive today.Within the Scottish Government, this process will be led by my colleague Stephen Gallagher,with assistance from others. One of them will be in touch with each local authority chiefexecutive shortly after they receive this letter. Thereafter, Ministers will be in contact withCouncil Leaders in the course of Tuesday  and Wednesday  October.Stephen and I will continue to stay closely in touch with you and colleagues in SOLACEeach day this week.Finally, let me thank you once again for the close, constructive and positive engagement Iand my colleagues have had with you and yours as we work together in these exceptionaltimes.

This is not the case. Whilst one detector is undoubtedly better than none, depending on the layout of the property, a number of detectors is usually necessary for adequate coverage. It is the requirement for interlinkingwhich is the contentious issue.Mains-powered systems with battery back-up and interlinked heads are the \"gold standard\", and it makes perfect sense to require these in multiple occupancies and new-builds. Retro-fitting, however, is hugely disruptive and prohibitively expensive, and cannot be justied for existing private dwellings. Many homes are already fitted with modern, self-contained detector heads incorporating -year lithium batteries and high-volume sounders, and give a timely audible warning prior to expiry. With very few exceptions, these are entirely satisfactory. Purchase of replacement detectors with the necessary wireless technology to enable interlinking offers little or no tangible benefit for the considerable outlay.No doubt the legislation is welcome news for installerswho can anticipate a bonanza. Widespread non-compliance by occupiers whoregard their existing provision as adequate is likely, and insurance companies will be gted another specious pretext to facilitate dodging their obligations.Apart from the ridiculous timescale , my opinion is that the statutory requirement for interlinking is ill-considered and disproportionate, and should be deleted from the legislation. Otherwise, substantial unnecessary expense will be incurred by those Scottish home owners who can afford it, and those who canrsquot will be unreasonably criminalised. I also have some concerns regarding possible unforeseen consequences of the uncontrolled and unnecessary proleration of wi devices. I do recognise, however, a case for interlinking may exist in anumber of single-occupancy domestic properties. If in doubt, oradvice is required on the optimum number, location or type of detector heads, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service will assist on request.Neil Sinclair, Paisley."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-yes-no-question-clear-used","story":"Perfectly clear and unambiguous and agreed by both sides.

Condemnation of this shameless power grab has come from the NFU, TUC, STUC and the House of Lords.Mr Stenhouse says Scotland is drawing on the financial strength of the UK during this pandemic when our dependency on Westminster precludes the Scottish Government from borrowing the money to, for example, extend the furlough scheme to save thousands of jobs, as other European countries are doing.

Let me take issue with some of them.First, apart from right-wing apologists, most commentators think that the UK Internal Market Bill will diminish rather than increase devolved powers.Secondly, he thinks that the UK is a strong player in international financial markets. Does this explain why the pound would buy   years ago and will buy . today Thirdly, and most surprisingly, he quotes a recent poll that states that % more Scots favour remaining in the UK than leaving. I have looked for this poll and failed to find it.Facts matter too, Mr Stenhouse.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.ALEX Salmondrsquos lawyer has called on the Scottish Government to publish the legal advice that it receivedbecause there is a clear public interest in reading and understanding why it spent large sums of taxpayersrsquo money in defending his court action before conceding defeat.Those who understand the court process know that legal costs increase dramatically in the lead-up to a full hearing.The Government had the benefit of advice from external lawyers, including a prominent senior counsel. Clearly it was told at some point that its position was untenable and required to be conceded. That concession took place only on January , , one week before the full hearing date and months after the action had been raised..If the Government delayed in accepting the legal advice which it had been given , that delay cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, not only in respect of Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs but the bill the Government incurred to its own lawyers.The Scottish taxpayers, as the ones who footed the bill for all of this, are surely entitled to know.George Moore, Glasgow G.Read more:Guy Stenhouse: Words matter and the independence question should be a dferent one"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-now-allow-coronavirus-defeat-hope","story":"This was highlighted in the First Ministers briefing todaywhen, in answer to a question on students ing home at Christmas, it was stated that the preference, whilst having to follow the science, would be that they could possiblyhome.

.Experts said the data from the Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmissionstudy showed immunity was ldquowaning quite rapidly, which could lead to an increased risk of reinfection.Some , adults took part in three rounds of testing for the study between late June and September to measure the prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in England.The study found that antibody levels fell by . per

prevalence and saw the largest drop, with antibody levels falling by  per cent.It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts, scientists said.Graham Cooke, professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said: ldquoThe big picture here is that after the first wave , the great majority of the country still did not have evidence of protective immunity.ldquoSo although we are seeing a decline in the proportion of people who are testing positive, we still have a great majority of people who are unlikely to have been exposed.ldquoSo the need for a vaccine is still very largeyou want to try and get a large level of protection in the population.The study found there was no change in antibody positivity in healthcare workers between June and September.Helen Ward, professor of Public Health at Imperial College London, said this could indicate ldquoongoing transmission of coronavirus in those settings or ldquorepeated exposure.Asked about herd immunity, Prof Ward said: ldquoEven at best, per centof the population remained not likely protected, and now that has declined to over  per centof the

ldquowaning quite rapidly.In the latest round of the study, between September -, the prevalence of antibodies remained highest in London, and in those of black and Asian ethnicity.The decline in people testing positive for antibodies was largest in those who did not report having had Covid-, compared to those who said they previously tested positive for the virus.Professor Paul Elliott,

With each user given a “for you” page — a never-ending feed of videos tailored by an algorithm of your tastes — Maddie has been able to break through the boundaries of living on an island, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers from across the globe.Recalling the excitement of that first viral video, she told The Orcadian: “When I posted it, it was starting to do well, and it was quite exciting. I was saying to my mum and my step-dad, ‘Look, it’s got over , views — what’s happening !’ And then I woke up in the middle of the night, and it was two or three in the morning, and I had loads of messages from my friends, so I had a feeling that it had done pretty well. So I went onto TikTok and it was just over two million views.“Since that, it’s just kind of taken off. In the last five or six months, it has just kept growing. I’ve got around , followers, which is just mad!“I’ve been doing a lot of work with brands, which is amazing.”Maddie, who has been sent products and offers from big-name brands such as River Island, Bondi Sands, and BaByliss, has been able to make money and gain more recognition for her videos as the months have gone on.As well as showcasing her “glow up” skills, the -year-old has also been able to push forward her long-term goal of becoming a professional actress, with a series of performance videos showing off her acting and dancing talent.Indeed, Maddy has already taken several calls from television producers as a result of her TikTok success. She told The Orcadian that she recently received an offer to be on the risqué Channel Four dating show, Naked Attraction — which she quickly declined — and also turned down an offer for ITV’s Dressed to Impress.“I don’t knowreality TV is the route I want to go down,” explained Orkney’s TikTok star, who is currently looking into options for drama school.“I mean, in a few years that might change — but right now, I definitely have other goals and ambitions. I think once you’ve done a show like Love Island, for example, I think it’s very hard to get away from that name.“It’s always a bit daunting, being in a small community and wanting to do something that’s maybe a bit outside the box and a bit dferent. But people have been really lovely and really supportive, which I’ve appreciated, and I have so many messages from so many girls — and boys — in Orkney and Shetland, thanking me for doing something dferent and putting myself out there.

Although non-essential travel would not be allowed to or from areas at level three or above.Hospitality venues would also permitted to serve alcohol indoors and outdoors, unlike the current temporary restrictions.Level two is described as broadly similar to the current restrictions in most of Scotland, whereas level three has been compared to the situation in the central belt, where stricter measures are in place.Level four would be closer to a full lockdown, with closure of non-essential shops, although Ms Sturgeon said even those restrictions would be lesser than those introduced for the first lockdown in March.She said level four would not be used unless #absolutely necessary# when infection rates became #very high#.Ms Sturgeon said she would be listening to views from stakeholders, including local authorities and businesses.She said recent figures indicated the current restrictions were working.Although case numbers continue to rise, the rate at which they are doing so has declined to just seven per cent in the latest week # down from  per cent a fortnight ago.Ms Sturgeon said was grounds for #cautious optimism# and hoped there could be a reduction cases in the weeks ahead.She said:ldquoI know that when people hear the daily figures itrsquos easy to feel as though the hard sacrices we are all living with are not making a dference.#But by taking these dficult steps we will help suppress the virus, and that is why I am asking everyone to stick with it.Ms Sturgeon has not confirmed which tiers will apply to dferent parts of the country but is expected to do so next week.The only restrictions on travel and movement will be imposed on us ourselves while our health and businesses will be sacriced so foreign fishing companies and international energy companies can carry on unrestricted raping our hills and seas...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Six houses for rent and four houses under shared ownership have been built, resulting in the population increasing by  per cent over the  years of ownership.”However, the trust remains concerned that the ever-increasing prices being realised for crofts and houses make it very dficult for young people to remain in the community.“It is hoped that this legislation can be used to keep existing houses under permanent residence rather than becoming holiday homes,” Mr Campbell added.After analysing the consultation’s finding, the Scottish Government will introduce the agreed changes in April of next year."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Scotland-Football-Team-credit-SCOTLANDNATIONALTEAM-TWITTER-web.jpg","title":"why i have stopped watching scotland at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY NORRIE T MACDONALDSpeaking last week about how football, the only sport I really thought I knew anything about, had undergone such a radical transformation, made me examine my perceptions about other sports.When it comes to their rules, am I completely at ease that I actually know what’s going on Heck no. Are you Football used to be very basic and straightforward, offside was the only really complicated bit and I understood it perfectly when black was black and white was white: now I don’t even comprehend what it is that’s happening with the competitions that our teamsparticipate in.What were we playing in over last weekend How many back doors are we being offered now to make it to the European Championships Is it a back door What is the Nations League and how is our group made up only of ‘diddy’ teams like ourselves Why are Spain playing Portugal, England-Belgium, while we appear to be in a group with countries younger than my mother What even is the Nations League, and are UEFA  FIFA simply intent on giving every single team as many possibilities as they can to qualy for a finals, no matter how meaningless I have to be honest, I’ve stopped watching Scotland.If I don’t know most of the players, don’t understand the rules any more, and don’t know what competition we’re playing in, why would I Doubtless Steve Clarke will be put to the sword when he cannot manage to come close to manufacturing even a plastic purse from an often-depleted squad, certainly one devoid of enough major talent to progress.And repeat.Do I know what’s going on in a rugby match Calm down.I get completely flummoxed by some of the decisions and nuances of their laws.But then again, it’s not my game and the understanding of the rules of any sport where my interest is merely in the passing, often confounds my ‘enjoyment’ of it.Basketball too.I’ve even been to more Orlando Magic gamesthan I’ve attended rugby matches in my own country.But don’t even start me on their biggest sport, baseball, which is as confusing to me as backgammon and bridge combined.It’s basically a ball and a bat, running round a diamond and more statistics than are currently being thrown at us by the chief medical officer and Boris.I simply cannot get into it.But then again, I was never meant to.Where the premise is simplethen there shouldn’t be too many rules necessary to prevent us enjoying what originally started out as some fun, some exercise, a pastime.They began with just fiveand progressed to .Nowadays offside itself takes up more definition than the original five in their entirety.When it comes to golf, there is a whole handbook.A radical overhaul recently has seen some of the silliness eradicated and the original  rules, outlined in just  words, have been reduced to just a small, compact, encyclopaedia.I was recently at a golf quiz where, of the  questions asked, I was proficient in less than a third .Try explaining stableford or a par bogey competition against the course to a Martian.Give me cricket and I have a clue.It’s quite simple.I have an old, framed, tea-towel in my shed which proclaims them thus: ‘You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.‘When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in.‘There are two men called umpires who stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.‘When both sides have been in and all the men have out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!’See It’s important to know the rules, what their purpose is and how to best interpret them so as to understand what it is that’s going on in the field.Isn’t it RULES OUT THE WINDOWThe rules appear to fly out the window down at Askernish where their correspondent, captain and current winner of just about everything, happens to be the same guy.He could just be making it all up, sending me bogus reports and watching his star rise, while bewildered colleagues helplessly look on.They say that history is written by the winners, but the reality is nowadays that it is written by those with the only pen.From Colin Russell, a man who can be described in many adjectives, not all of them beginning with the same letter.Alliteration can be a tricky path.I jest, however, he indeed is having a sterling month.ROAD TO HARRISScarista on Saturday saw the second instalment of their Road to Harris competition and it was with a deal of excitement that I made it down for the first time in a month.It was blowing a hoolieand any bad hole would be quickly consigned to the bin.The par bogey format has its compensations.Winner on the day, continuing his recent fine form, was Murdo F MacLeod who finished + versus the course.He managed to prevail on countbackfrom a pack including

several months at a time does imbue a swing-rustiness which only lager and practice can eradicate. days quarantine doesn’t help either.One thing is for certain it doesn’t, ever, wipe the smile off his face.His -point total for a win last Wednesday contained an eagle, no less , and a scattering of par golf which contributed massively to his tally in the October stableford.Martyn Macleod required no

shinty star Lorna MacRae made a debut to remember as she stole the show with a four-goal salvo to propel Inverness Caledonian Thistle Women to a - victory over Westdyke on Sunday.Lorna, who has made a name for herself as an attacking talent for both Skye Ladies Camanachd and the Scotland national team in recent years, showed her skills on the football pitch with a commanding performance as ICT women recorded an emphatic win on the opening day of the Championship North campaign.MacRae showcased her predatory instinct in front of goal in ruthless fashion by striking four times in the opening  minutes to put the contest to bed before half-time.After leaving her marker for dead following a powerful run down the left-wing, MacRae fired high into the net to open the scoring.Her second came from a finely timed run in which she burst past the Westdyke defence to latch onto a pass from deep and, unruffled by the outrushing keeper, kept her cool to slot the ball low into the net to make it -.She completed her hat-trick with another powerful shot, this time after a brilliantly cushioned pass from the right-hand side played her into the box. Taking one touch MacRae set herself up before lashing a venomous right-foot strike beyond the Westdyke keeper.Her fourth goal owed more to good positioning than style as she kept her nerve to tuck away a tap-in past the beleaguered opposition keeper.Kayleigh MacKenzie then added a fth for the Caley Jags to cap off an emphatic start to the season for the Highlanders.Commenting on MacRae’s dream debut, ICTWFC coach Karen Mason told the Free Press: “It was a very pleasing start to the season, to say the least!“Lorna’s debut couldn’t have gone any better for her, four goals within the opening  minutes with some great finishes in amongst them.She added: “She is going to be a real asset to us this season with her pace, power, and tenacity. She will definitely run defences ragged throughout the campaign.”Caley’s next fixture is scheduled for Sunday th October when they will take on Cove Rangers FCW away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PROFILE-MORAG-HANNAH-3.jpg","title":"forbes seeks radical improvement to universal credit as island claims","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBY ADAM GORDONFigures from Highland Council showed a  per cent increase in claims for welfare recorded by the Portree job centre between Marchand August .Sixteen to  year-olds and - year-olds have been the worst affected groups, with the number of people within both claimant brackets having risen by more than  per cent between March and August.In the - year-old age group the figure rose by a staggering  per cent — with  claims made in March and  made in August. The number spiked at  claims in July.Meanwhile the statistics for the - year-olds category also painted a worrying trend with a  per cent rise recorded between March and August. March saw , claims made, while that number escalated to , in August.The overall figures show that Portree job centre experienced the greatest rise in claims between March and August at  per cent, with Fort William the next greatest at  per cent of the six centres listed.The total number for the Highlands as a whole climbed from , in March to , in August. The greatest figure for the region across that period came in July when the number rose to ,.On Monday, Highland Council Leader Margaret Davidson said that the region has been hit hard by the many shortfalls arising from the UK Government’s benefit scheme.Reacting to the figures, Kate Forbes said: “The pandemic has a huge social and economic impact. Many people, particularly young people, have found themselves dependent on universal credit.“Some of those who are reliant on universal credit for the first time in their lives have told me that they cannot believe the UK Government expects anybody to live off the small weekly sums.“There have been some improvements to universal credit but these have been minimal and it is critical that the UK Government not only maintains those changes, but radically improves universal credit so that families and iniduals can survive.“As redundancies increase in advance of the end of the furlough scheme, the Scottish Government has sought to provide employability support. However, it would be far better to keep people in work in the first place.She added: “If anybody is struggling to access universal credit or finds themselves with nowhere  to go, I would encourage them to get in touch with my office and I will do everything I possibly can to help.”The bureau manager at the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau has said changes need to be made to the Universal Credit system to halt the “desperate cycle of debt and destitution”.: “The Universal Credit monthly standard allowance for those aged under  years is £. – some people may get more money on top of the standard allowance – housing costs,eligible, with the claimant possibly having to wait for around five weeks for the first payment.“They can ask for an advance, but this must be paid back.“Claims for Universal Credit must normally be made and maintained online. Alternative, offline options are only available in exceptional circumstances. Many claimants are in financial dficulty before they apply for Universal Credit, with some delaying making their claim until they are in dficulty.“The department’s analysis of earnings data found that nearly half of claimants –  per cent — had no earnings in the three months before they apply for Universal Credit.“The initial five-week wait can exacerbate claimants’ debt and financial dficulties.”She explained that since Universal Credit was introduced, evidence from the CAB has suggested that a signicant minority of people do not have the internet access or digital skills required to make and maintain their claims online.She said: “Within this group, those with disabilities, mental or physical health conditions, learning dficulties, poor literacy skills and other complex needs, appear to face particular disadvantages and barriers to online claim maintenance.“In fact, some simply may never be able to do so without substantial support. Those living in rural areas can also face unique dficulties. Such claimants can therefore be at serious risk of sanction , which can result in signicant hardship.“The UK government does offer an advance loan system so people can access cash sooner. But that simply adds another line of credit to people’s outgoings and pushes them further into that debt spiral. Our evidence base tells us that it is dficult to get by on Universal Credit even before your advance loan repayments are deducted.”Since th March this year the Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau have dealt with , client contacts,  per cent of these contacts –  client contacts — have been with regards to Universal Credit – people looking for advice on advance payments, reporting changes of circumstances, needing assistance with claiming and backdating, getting help with the housing element, how to supply medical evidence that they are unfit to look for work, online access issues, payment issues schedules, reconsiderations and work capability assessments.Ms Hannah added: “We believe that advance loans should be replaced by a non-repayable payment system that protects the most vulnerable from destitution – like having to rely on food banks – during the waiting period.“Alongside this, it makes much more sense for people to just get their first payment sooner we say within two weeks. Provide suitable non-digital options for iniduals to make and manage their Universal Credit claims and promote these options to claimants, particularly disabled people, people with health conditions and other complex needs.“Get it wrong and we will continue to see people in the same desperate cycle of debt and destitution, but get it right and we can begin to reverse the trend of working poverty.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lochnevis-credit-Creative-CommonsThe-Carlisle-Kid.jpg","title":"small isles should not be held","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine this week, chair Camille Dressler said that residents of Eigg had at times been stuck in the middle of the local authority and the ferry operator in what she described as a “complete breakdown in communication” between the parties.At present the Small Isles are served by the MV Lochnevis vessel which launched in . However, since May the community have been lobbying for maintenance work to be carried out at Eigg harbour, as Ms Dressler explained.“As the chair of the community council, I have had numerous correspondences with the Highland Council to establish that they would stand by their statutory obligation to do a bathymetric survey — which they haven’t carried out for  years — to make sure that the approach to Eigg harbour is safe in very low tide.“There seems to be an issue of more sand being there than there used to be. There also seems to be a problem with the fenders at the pier which were reported to the harbour authority on th May and nothing was done to fix it.“There were also problems with the fenders on the harbour at Muck, and Highland Council was contracted to fix them there but neglected to fix the ones on Eigg at the same time.”She added: “I just feel that as the Highland Council is getting pier dues from CalMac, they should have a regular schedule of maintenance.“I know that the Highland Council is extremely strapped for cash, but the communities that are depending on ferries such as the Lochnevis for a leline shouldn’t be held hostage by the problems they have with the finances or the relationship they have with CalMac.”Ms Dressler said that a Highland Council contractor was now on the case, but highlighted that islanders have also been troubled by cancellations during a period in which the local economy was seeking a final boost for the year from visitors.She said: “The month of September was crucial to get a few visitors on the island and there have been cancellations left, right and centre because of bad weather, direction of wind and tidal conditions which have really created a lot hassle for customers on and off the island.”Supplies to the shop on Eigg are delivered via Mallaig, where the Spar shop receives its orders while provisions for the island are sent to the CalMac office there. However,there is a cancellation then the delivery has to be sent back to the supplier.“We are not going to starve but what is annoying is that shop orders have had to be sent back to the supplier because they can’t be delivered,” said Camille.Addressing the cancellations, she said: “We understand that CalMac won’t endanger any of its vessels — they are in such a precarious position as they don’t have any replacement. If anything happens to the Lochnevis they can’t replace it.”Ms Dressler said her contact at the council was very pleasant and quick to respond to the islanders requests but added: “What worries me is that the council seems to want to encourage the community to complain to CalMac and it’s not our place to do that.“It’s our job to make sure the schedule of maintenance is done and in a timely manner. No community complaint is going to change a master’s decision because that’s final.”She added: “We are not sure on what basis the master’s decisions are based — there are factors that are obviously beyond our knowledge but they are not communicated to the community in any great detail.”She said that CalMac representatives and members of the harbour authority appeared to have come to an agreement but added that it was “quite alarming” that Highland Council’s harbour authority had to taken so long to deal with what is a statutory obligation.Caol and Mallaig councillor Allan Henderson, who represents the Small Isles, has said that Eigg has not been caught in the middle of a debate between the local authority and CalMac and that decisions on pier repairs were down to the harbour master’s judgment.Councillor Hendersontold the Free Press that the islanders understood the council’s efforts to make sure that the piers and harbours were in top condition but said that it has not been possible due to the logistics involved.He said: “When a problem is identied and that will most likely be caused by a vessel berthing and putting strain on the fender, or whichever part it comes in contact with, the Highland Council need to instruct marine carpenters to fix.“Iniably the repairer will have a schedule of work and also needs to find a weather window to venture out into the sound. I do not believe the Eigg problem was identied when the Muck work was completed.“Even when the Eigg repair was identied the Highland Council harbour manager did not see it as an impediment to the CalMac vessel berthing, but still the repair company were once again given an instruction to mobilise and repair.”He added: “This is not the community being caught in the middle of a Highland Council-CalMac debate but rather the master making his judgement call.“While the council tries its best to have the piers and harbours in A condition, it is just not possible all the time with the logistics involved. I believe the islanders understand this.“The council have also commissioned a bathymetric survey this year to help the masters navigate the safe channels in the Small Isles harbours.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3411600.jpg--.jpg?1602676940000\n","title":"austin s cycle raises 1 580 for diabetes uk","story":"AUSTIN Graham’s  miles sponsored cycle ride has raised over pound, for Diabetes UK!The -year-old Ballymena man completed his journey last Tuesday night.“I set myself the target of  miles to be completed during the month of September,” outlined Austin.“I put the finishing touches on completing it last week and am delighted that I raised more than my original pound, target.”His total amount raised is pound,Austin, himself a diabetic, thanks everyone single person who donated.“The money is going to Diabetes UK, a very worthy cause.

But he was delighted to be steered on to the Diabetes UK’s Cycle for September. Austin signed up for the  miles - and had the full month of September to pedal this distance, and collect sponsorship for Diabetes UK along the way.The Digital Sales and Marketing man at Algram in Railway Street, Ballymena, was more than busy at work and admitted finding it tough to get the time to cycle.Eighteen years ago he was diagnosed with Type  diabetes.“This obviously was a big change not just for me but for my family and those around me too,” outlined Austin. “I’ve always been into sport whether it’s football, rugby, golf or cycling and I felt that cycling  miles throughout the month of September was a great way for me to raise money for Diabetes UK and give a little back.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1602771523139.jpg--mayor_praises_schoolboys_for_their_heroic_actions.jpg?1602771532000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20201015newsmayor praises schoolboys for their heroic actions","story":"THE Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council has formally honoured four teenagers who rescued a father and his two children from the sea at White Park Bay earlier this year.

Lauren HarteTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSchool chiefs have insisted that children shouldto the classroom at the end of the half-term break.Schools are due to open again next Monday following an extended mid-term break, aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolshas said that keeping schools open for learning must be a priority for government and wider society.Chief executive Gerry Campbell said the council was extremely concerned about both the impact on young people and the longer-term effects that the crisis would have on pupils.We all need to play our part in adhering to public health guidance and regulations to help to create a safe environment that will enable and facilitate schools to remain open on a continuing basis, Mr Campbell said.Schools are at the heart of society. As well as places of learning, they are centres of support, care, friendship, personal development and growth. Keeping our schools open for learning must be a priority for government and wider society. We must support our young people#s emotional and mental health and wellbeing.Mr Campbell added: We each have a role to play in managing this pandemic so that school leaders and their staff can be allowed to focus on the needs and aspirations of their pupils, despite the challenge of Covid-. As we progress into the coming months, the challenges for our schools will become more complex. Our schools need a clear pathway that will support them and minimise the longer-term impacts on the educational progression and wellbeing of our young people as we all work through the remainder of this pandemic.Graham Gault, president of the National Association of Head Teacherssaid all must be done to support principals in the reopening of schools next week. Mr Gault added: I am very grateful to CCMS for recognising the enormous strain that this pandemic has added to the already very challenging circumstances of school leaders. And this is true of school leaders across all of our sectors.Given the very signicant additional burden of contact tracing, it is essential that principals are given the space to manage the critical business at hand with no other distractions or requirements being added by other bodies within education, he said. Both the Education Minister Peter Weir and Northern Ireland#s children#s commissioner Koulla Yiasouma have opposed any move to extend school closures here beyond two weeks.Last week Mr Weir revealed that , positive cases of coronavirus have been recorded in Northern Ireland schools between August  and October  - which includes teachers, staff and students. Mr Weir said there had been little evidence that schools were signicantly contributing to rising Covid- numbers.Ms Yiasouma added: I can see no reason why this or any future school break should be extended for anyof time. If the issue in relation to schools is outside the school gates, we must tackle that without disrupting our children#s education and we must also get smarter at dealing with identied cases of Covid in schools.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Expelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The claim is a positive given that the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, the pharmaceutical company said.A company spokesman said: It#s encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity [vaccine reaction] was lower in older adults, where the Covid- disease severity is higher.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHealth Secretary Matt Hancock FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHealth Secretary Matt HancockHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday it is his central expectation that the majority of the roll-out of a vaccine could be under way in the first half of , stressing the bulk of the programme could happen before next summer.When asked about reports that hospitals are preparing to vaccinate staff, Mr Hancock told the BBC that it#s not my central expectation that we#ll be doing that this year. He added: We don#t know when the first vaccine will be available but my central expectation is in the first half of next year.A Department of Health spokesperson here said the Government has secured access to six potential Covid- candidates.This reflects the UK#s strategy to ensure we have a supply of vaccines should any of these prove safe and effective, they said. The vaccines are currently at ious stages of the human trials that they must complete before they can be considered for use in a vaccination programme.The best case scenario is that we will have a vaccine in use before the end of the year and we are currently planning on that basis, however, realistically it may be next year before sufficient doses are available to vaccinate on a large scale.Professor Ultan Power, Professor of Molecular Virology at Queen#s University, warned it is very dficult to estimate when a vaccine will be made available.He said regardless of any estimated roll-out, it is crucial that the third trial of any vaccine candidate meets all safety requirements. A lot depends on the safety profile of phase three. If it is successful and safe, and its efficacy is assured then there should be no problem, he said.Professor Power also emphasised the roll-out of a vaccine will depend on an effective manufacturing process. Another factor, he argued, is the willingness of the public to have the vaccine.

These issues, compounded by the ongoing health pandemic, has resulted in immense strain being placed on the service. I raised the concerns of the Ambulance Service directly with the Health Minister. Giving the worrying figures noted by the Health Minister of the limited capacity of Rapid Response Vehicles and ambulances during recent months, it is crucially important that the Minister urgently intervenes to provide maximum support to NIAS and ensures that the service is properly resourced.NIAS warned in July that it was facing increased challenges in maintaining planned levels of cover across all of its isions in Northern Ireland, meaning that response times to some calls would be delayed.It outlined a range of reasons for the drop in staff cover and delayed response times.This included increased use of NIAS services over recent years without an increase in staffing levels, % of frontline staff being absent due to ordinary sickness or reasons related to Covid-, annual leave commitments, assaults on staff and similar issues facing Trust staff.NIAS chief executive Michael Bloomfield has appealed for support from politicians to ensure that ambulances remain available to respond to le-threatening emergencies.

Connaire McGreevy, spokesperson for the Mourne AONB Against Wind Farms group, said it was concerning.“It’s a huge sum of money, particularly when there’s so many people who have been excluded from grant support,” he said.“To see wind turbines being grant-funded just begs lots more questions around the entire energy industry.”He said all wind turbine development should be halted until a full investigation is carried out.Mr Dickson said it was possible that many more businesses had been paid in error and that getting the money back could be dficult.“I think the reality is that payments were made in a very big rush back in March,” he said.“Politicians and the media were calling for urgent action to keep businesses afloat and to allow employees to be paid.“Regrettably it was inevitable that mistakes would be made. What now needs to be done is that those mistakes can be rectied and that we can be sure public money is spent properly and given to the right people.”He added: “I’m not quite sure how you go backwards. Will it require a change in the regulations to recoup that money becauseit was properly made at the time then I’m not quite sure what you can do about it.“Obviously there’s a range of issues here from wind turbines to anaerobic digesters. It may very well be that there were other categories of businesses who may have received funds.”Mr Beggs said it was “outrageous” that over £, was paid out to turbine owners when many businesses in need got nothing. He called on Diane Dodds to find out how the error occurred, recoup the money and give clarity on whether the £, grant was given to other energy generators — and ensure the “fiasco” was not repeated.A department spokesperson said the “necessary, swt action” to support thousands of businesses in crisis was taken with £m paid out to over , businesses.They added that “the unprecedented speed and scale” of the Executive’s response to the pandemic had been acknowledged by Comptroller and Auditor General Kieran Donnelly.The department said it would “where possible seek to recover any funding that may have been paid to those deemed ineligible to receive payment”.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandDoraville: Plans for NI#s largest ever wind farm rejected Planning permission has been denied for what would have been Northern Ireland#s biggest ever wind farm.Northern IrelandNichola Mallon asked to agree to inquiry into Mournes wind farm projectStormont minister Nichola Mallon is being asked to agree to another public inquiry into a plan for a wind farm - this time on the Mourne Mountains.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Expelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In some respects it#s sad to see that so many families need the help, but it#s also so heartening to watch people come off the streets with cash donations and bags of shopping as they just want to help out.We#re across the road from the Royal Victoria Hospital and we#ve had a lot of staff just drop off bags of groceries to help, she said. Irwins bakery asked us how many loaves we wanted. There are so many people who just want to do the right thing and I know there are many, many families out there who are so grateful for the help.This isn#t just about finance, she said. This is about providing nutritional meals for children and as long as we#re needed we#ll keep on doing it.Pauline said the publicity given to the crisis by the England footballer has been extraordinary.He noticed what we were doing and gave us a thumbs up. We never expected that and we certainly never expected the community spirit that has been flowing ever since, she said.And it#s great to see so many other cafes around Belfast now getting involved.One of those taking up the initiative and providing free lunches for school children is Victoria Armstrong at The Lamppost Cafe on the Newtownards Road.While we do know Stormont has made provision to continue the school meals voucher scheme, there are always some who are in danger of slipping trough the cracks, she said.We made the decision over the weekend that we had to try to do what we could. We#ve seen the impact it#s had on communities in England and wanted to try to give a little bit back.There are a lot of families who are struggling, the purse strings are tighter and the kids are now off school for an extended period of time. This isn#t just about providing a free lunch for kids who need it, it#s about reaching out to the community in general.We#re in a fortunate position to be able to do this andwe can help even a little bit it#s worth doing.We#ve always tried to work with charities and this is just an extension of that.We#ve been delighted with the response.It#s been a busy day, but a lot of people thought we#d just be doing this for today. That#s not the plan. We want to carry this on all week. We#ll just keep trying to help in any way we can.The community spirit is rising to the top around the country as well.In Co Armagh the staff at one local estate agency have been using their local knowledge to hit the road with deliveries of food and groceries around the area.Employees at Hannath, based in Portadown, teamed up with non-profit Covid support group Cafe Abundance to spend the weekend delivering around the Craigavon area.It was great to be involved, said managing director Alastair Glass. We always try to be as involved as possible with the local community and we#ve seen a real need for support on the doorstep.There#s a fair bit of fear out there this time, both in families and in businesses. We were happy to help and it#s great to see the community come together.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Expelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Brexit vote had just happened and Theresa May had just become Prime Minister.At Good Morning Britain, we weren#t quite down the mines, but -hour overnight marathon shts eight or nine times a month were starting to take their toll after two fascinating years on the programme.Little did I know as my email made its way to Number  supremo Fiona Hill that just weeks later I would be starting an exciting new le as special adviser to Secretary of State James Brokenshire.When he very sadly had to resign due to lung cancer  months later, I worked very briefly for his successor, Karen Bradley, even more briefly for Home Secretary Amber Rudd and then, having recovered from cancer, James came back into the Cabinet as Housing Secretary and asked me to serve alongside him again at his new department.I spent nearly three years in total working for James before he was sacked when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, after which I was transferred to the Ministry of Justice to work for the Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland.But in July , the entirety of this crazy, draining and incredibly interesting le was all ahead of me.Emailing Fiona, I had absolutely nothing to lose - except those dreaded, draining night shts on Good Morning Britain.I had always loved politics, leaping at the chance to do the subject at A-level under an inspiring teacher at Portadown College, Sean Dunlop. Later, when I was Spad at the Ministry of Justice, I had a group of Sean#s students into the Lord Chancellor#s office when they were over in London on a school trip. I#m afraid I breached protocol by allowing my former teacher to try on the Lord Chancellor#s wig, much to the amusement of his students and colleagues. Sean was game for a laugh as always, smiling happily as the students snapped away on their phones.I#d watched the news almost from infancy, and indeed remember aged five writing to - and receiving a reply from - UTV#s Paul Clark.But  years into my career, having known, met and sometimes become friends with Spads, I had done most of what I wanted to do in journalism. I had written suggested questions for Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight as my first proper job, worked for the BBC in Washington, New York, Belfast and London, been senior producer on Question Time aged  and been a reporter for five years too, on both radio and telly, reporting from Downing Street and the White House.Having interviewed everyone from Cate Blanchett to Timmy Mallett, I fancied a change.TV reporting especially is a ruthless game - your face either fits or it does not.Sometimes in my career it did, sometimes it did not, and that could change with the wind - as I and others painfully learned, it was not always the survival of the fittest.It was just  hours after my initial email that a reply came from Fiona Hill informing me, rather directly, that: James Brokenshire is about to ring you. James had been appointed Northern Ireland Secretary about  days previously, but I didn#t know him from Adam, and he, similarly, couldn#t have picked me out of a police line-up.Mildly panicking that I was about to be rung by a Cabinet minister, we actually missed each other#s calls, eventually speaking briefly and arranging to meet two days later in the plush surroundings of the five-star Corinthia Hotel in Westminster.Remarkably, it was just a week between our gin and tonic at the Corinthia Hotel and my confirmation as special adviser to the Secretary of State.As I was to learn, Spads in Westminster play a weird daily role to their ministers, somewhere between friend, gatekeeper, adviser and general dogsbody. As his media Spad, I was to advise James both on what to say in the crucial .am interview on the Today programme as well as reminding him to have a pee beforehand.As part of what I dubbed #The Brokenshire Travelling Circus# we generally operated a #where James goes I go# rule, the frequency of travel between Belfast and London one of the things that struck me the most when I first started the job at the NIO.But of course the travel is entirely necessary for the Northern Ireland Secretary to do the job. In  I took  flights for work, mostly between London and Belfast, but occasionally we travelled to Dublin and Brussels too, as we had many meetings with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and EU figures such as Michel Barnier about Brexit.It wasn#t the best carbon footprint, but the upsides were that the very nice flight attendants on Aer Lingus knew how I liked my teaand I can still recite the Aer Lingus and British Airways safety instruction presentation by heart. Indeed, one Aer Lingus flight attendant, a lovely woman called Louise Annon, even became my Facebook friend.The Northern Ireland Secretary also comes with a few friends - his or her police protection officers, who are with them  , whether out and about, in the office or staying at home or Hillsborough Castle, where James and I often stayed overnight in the beautul flats.Sadly, you are not allowed to sleep in the Queen#s bed any more, as I was told former Chancellor George Osborne once did.James#s protection officers got on well with him, but the   nature really is exactly that. So when the officers accompanied the family one afternoon on a trip to Chessington World of Adventures for one of the Brokenshire children#s birthdays, the following Monday, James joked that his officers were too scared to go on the rollercoasters - an experience each of them had, sadly, declined. The officers often dwarfed James, who is ft ins tall and mockingly refers to himself as #The Hobbit from the Broken-shire#. With this in mind, the Monday morning after the family theme park visit, I asked the assembled officers: So, was James tall enough for the rides then Le at the Northern Ireland Office wasn#t always a laughing matter, of course, and the collapse of Stormont in January  necessitated a lot more time in intensive talks with figures such as Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams - the terrorist bogeymen of my youth - and Arlene Foster, all of whom I had interviewed as a journalist. But of course it is very dferent to be across the table from these people helping to negotiate than shoving a UTV or BBC Northern Ireland microphone in their face.The scheduling of the election in  unhelpfully stalled these talks, but working on the Conservative Party#s campaign set the stage for one of the most special days I had working with James.That was May , , when I accompanied James to the Balmoral Show for a campaign visit alongside then Prime Minister Theresa May. James and Mrs May were mobbed as they walked through the tented stands on the gloriously sunny day, sampling the fine fare and chatting with stallholders. Arlene Foster was also there, and heard the PM was also attending that day and came up to say hello. Later, we were accused of stage managing the meeting, but that was not so. with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dee .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in \"Insider: Peter Cardwellwith Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInsider: Peter Cardwellwith Secretary of State James Brokenshire and Prime Minister Theresa May at Balmoral Show in  At one stage, just in advance of some planned media interviews with the Prime Minister, someone realised no private briefing space had been set aside for Mrs May to go over what might be asked, something that is done before every media interview.Quick as a flash, Home Office Spad Mo Hussein convinced a stallholder in one of the gazebos to allow us to brief the PM in a tiny area where stock was stored.It was a tad surreal for me going through the lines on Northern Ireland and Brexit with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as she sat on a plastic chair surrounded by boxes containing hundreds of bags of Tayto cheese and onion crisps. But the interviews were word-perfect and we breathed a sigh of relief afterwards.I was used to travelling with James and his protection officers, but with the Prime Minister it is a more elaborate affair. There is a long convoy of numerous vehicles, what the Americans call a motorcade. The Northern Ireland visit was the first time I had travelled with police motorcycle outriders and their flashing blue lights, and it really was quite cool as they sped alongside us. The Prime Minister was only in Northern Ireland for a few hours, but I will remember that bright, brilliant day for a letime.The Secret Le of Special Advisers, by Peter Cardwell, is published by Biteback tomorrow  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Expelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Among - year olds the gap was even more pronounced with % to % strongly in favour of Irish unity.Read MorePoll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckUnionists are unfazed by Taoiseach Micheal Martin#s stance on a united IrelandPeter Robinson hits out at #border poll deniers# urging unionists to prepare for referendumSinn Fein MP John Finucane said: The conversation on a new Ireland is under way and it is thriving. Micheal Martin and the Irish Government are worryingly out of touch with the aspirations of the people of this island. The Irish Government cannot stand idly by. They must lead the preparations for a new, united Ireland.The LucidTalk poll indicated that the NHS would play a key role in deciding a border poll with % of people definitely voting for Irish unity, % for the Union - but % saying they#d likely opt to remain in the UK because of the NHS.UUP leader Steve Aiken said: The NHS is quite rightly the source of great national pride within the UK and is the envy of many countries. Its central role has never been more evident than during the Covid pandemic.It is perfectly understandable that, in any consideration of the merits of the Union, voters of all persuasions would be extremely reluctant to give up the NHS and exchange it for the system that is in place in the Republic of Ireland.DUP MP Carla Lockhart said the poll confirmed the importance of our UK national institutions like the NHS but said the health service should be strengthened, not at the centre of a isive border poll campaign.Northern Ireland benefits hugely from being part of the UK and we have seen that clearly demonstrated through the response to the Covid- pandemic. Those who want to remove Northern Ireland from the NHS put their party politics above the wellbeing of the public, she said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the poll indicated that health was a key consideration when considering constitutional change. That#s why the SDLP is undertaking the hard work of exploring what public services in a new Ireland would look like, he said. It is a myth that uniting this island means the wholesale privatisation of one of our greatest assets. Our challenge is to conceive a new way of doing things that takes the best of both systems and delivers better health outcomes for our people.A TUV spokesman said: Far from the pandemic quickening the drive for Irish unity, it has underscored the fact that we are better off as part of the UK with even the most republican areas applauding the NHS.The poll results underscore that, when it comes down to it, the people of Northern Ireland would be too canny to vote for a united Ireland.Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said his party#s immediate focus was on Covid and Brexit but we do nevertheless recognise we are in a fluid situation with multiple conversations around the future of these islands.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumexclusivePoll: NHS could be crucial in border poll with support for united Ireland and the Union running neck-and-neckThe NHS will play a major role in deciding a border poll with support for the Union and a united Ireland neck-and-neck, according to a new survey.Northern IrelandUnionists are unfazed by Taoiseach Micheal Martin#s stance on a united IrelandThe Taoiseach#s toughened stance on a united Ireland after he said a border poll was not on his current agenda shouldn#t prevent friendly British-Irish relations, unionists have said.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Antrim Hospital #beyond capacity# as five deaths and  new cases of Covid- confirmedMad Dog#s daughter Chloe Adair rubbishes #sex video#Expelled UVF boss beat up ex in street... drug-dealing coward dragged victim by hair as he drove off in carVideos of Tyrone boy Darragh O#Neill#s earnest farm talk become viral sensationNorthern Ireland street cleaner who quizzed boy about sex makes a break for it,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Neil McCafferty has underlying health conditions including a heart problem and diabetes and is therefore in several at-risk categories. Upon entering the hospital the -year-old was Covid negative but has now contracted the virus. Mr McCafferty is a father of five to son Michael and four daughters, Andrea, Karen, Sinead and Emma. When added to his other health conditions his family believe it will take a ‘miracle’ for him to survive. googletag.cmd.push Since the start of the pandemic, the now retired man has adhered to all the rules by shielding and when society reopened took every precaution, deciding to spend most of his time at home. The heartbroken family say that he was the one they were trying to protect throughout. His son Michael said: “Ma dad is not good, all we can do is hope, but there’s not much hope there.” Mr McCafferty’s his we Bridieadded: “Put it this way, it would take a big, big miracle for my husband to survive this.”  They made it clear that this is ‘not criticism of the NHS’ but a means of highlighting complacency in the community and government failures. googletag.cmd.push Michael explained: “This is about awareness of wearing masks, about social distancing, about trying to keep people out of hospital who don’t need to be there. “This is about a liaison officer being at the hospital to inform families about their loved one’s condition during this dficult time when you can’t be there to hold their hand. “And it’s about people not having house parties or gatherings.” COMMUNICATION Lack of communication meant the family were unaware that their husband and father was on dialysis as the infection was ‘attacking his kidneys’. The next day they discovered that he had developed sepsis which is a potentially le-threatening condition caused by the bodys response to an infection.     His son raised concerns that while dropping off medication for his fathers diabetes some hospital staff were not wearing masks. They believe that with the rise in local cases extra precautions should be taken in Derry, especially inside the hospital. “Retail and hospitality staff who aren’t in direct contact with you have to wear a mask. “But when I went into a hospital these people weren’t wearing masks, it doesn’t make sense,” Michael said. On Monday morning they found out that their dad had ‘taken a turn’ during the night and had been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit . A consultant assured the family that negative Covid tests had been ed twice but the infection was ‘really bad’. He was ventilated for fluid in the lungs, kidneys being worked on through dialysis and they were trying to give him strong antibiotics to fight the infection. They tried phoning for hours to get an update when at .pm on October  they were informed that he had contracted Covid. Now, more than ever, when people cant visit sick friends or relatives they believe that better communication is needed from the Trust to provide updates on their condition and peace of mind. Bridie commented: “There has been a lack of communication. My husband couldn’t communicate to me because he wasn’t very lucid, he was telling me that he got his kidney drained and a young nurse or receptionist told me that no it was his gall bladder. “No doctor phoned me to tell me that he had sepsis, no doctor phoned me to tell me that he was getting dialysis, no doctor phoned me until last night to tell me that he had Covid but we had to chase it up. “If I was allowed, I’m not saying we should be, butI seen my husband and the way he was deteriorating I could demand to see a doctor. “But it’s lack of communication, there should be some type of family liaison to let you know what is going on.” She continued: “I understand that doctors and nurses sign up to take care of people, they don’t sign up to go into work and take their own lives in their hands. “At the very start, hotels were open to hospital staff, BBs were open to them, they were all shielding but now that’s not happening when it’s re. I just don’t understand it.” After the Derry News contacted the Trust about the family’s concerns they did receive a positive call from a nurse who provided a comprehensive update. ‘PERFECT FATHER’  The family collectively understand the exceptional times we’re living in but believe there is still room for a compassionate approach. Michael said: “These are dficult times but it takes the humanity away from it when in normal circumstances,this is his last few days of le, we could be there holding his hand. “I went back to leave a phone charger for him and asked could I go in to see him and was told ‘no, you’re not allowed’, and that’s the last time I’ll probably see him.” Her voice shaking with emotion, Bridie paid tribute to her husband: “People always think their parents are the best in the world, but I’m telling you now, they have a perfect father. “He would do anything for them.” In tears his daughters explained that their father was the kindest man who cared for people. Recently he did everything in his power to help -year-old Derry man, Blian Bowe, who was in an induced coma because of Coronavirus. Mr McCafferty’s daughter Emma said: “We do not want any other family to go through this. “He shielded all during lockdown and when it was lted he wore a mask and wasn’t going out to places he shouldn’t have been. “But he has gone in there and contracted Covid, with the underlying issues he might not have got out but this has just put a tonne of bricks on top of his other issues. “We want people to take responsibility. It’s not about contracting it. Somebody could go into the hospital with a sore toe and not come out. “There are a lot of staff off shielding too, this is not an attack on the NHS or a personal attack on any nurses, it’s about people understanding the seriousness of this now and making the right decisions about whether or not to go to hospital. “Andthey do, they have to take extra care.” Michael concluded: “This is directed at the government. We need another full lockdown, we need what I call a time-stop. “Send everybody home, stop mortgages and so on and give people a small subsidy for food. “This is not the Spanish flu this is worse, because people will not abide by the rules and respect what it is. “The government is trying to look after the economy. To put everybody in their homes again will damage the economy, but to put everyone out to work will damage it even more because it will put enormous pressure on the NHS and thousands of people will be off work sick.”  TRUST RESPONSE The Trust was asked to respond to the families concerns. In particular, given that visiting was suspended during the first wave of the virus, whether the Trust had used the time in between to establish a communication channel for families to ensure they have updates. Due to the ‘overwhelming number of media queries’ the Trust is receiving at present, a spokesperson said it was unable to provide a direct response. However, it did point out that visiting was suspended from October  until further notice. The Trust acknowledged that it is a ‘dficult time’ for the public and said that ‘virtual visits’ can be arranged. Visiting will only be permitted under very special circumstances at Altnagelvin Hospital including in paediatrics, maternity, palliative care and dementia  learning disability. “Our priority is to safeguard and protect people who are receiving care and also to protect our staff. “If you are permitted to visit under special circumstances you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting Altnagelvin Hospital,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He tells Michael McMullan of the decision, the ups, the downs the memories along the way. Four days after this years county hurling final, Liam Hinphey took a moment to post a brief, yet the most poignant of tweets. Fteen words. Four photos. Three jersies. Red, black and white hearts. The colours he soldiered in. The former Dungiven and Derry footballer, was putting away his hurl. “Father time is undefeated,” it began. A career that juggled big and wee ball, across school, college, club and county had run its course.  googletag.cmd.push “You know when the time is right and you have dferent priorities,” he stated early in our interview. His we Clare had given up work to be their son Liams full-time carer. The three year-old lives with Dravet Syndrome, a drug-resistant form of epilepsy that leads to seizures and visits to hospital. “He just needs full time care and we decided Clare was the best person to do it,” Liam adds. Their daughter Cara is now in P. On the Wednesday after the final, her and Daddy went for a walk. “It was a nice evening and it wouldve been one of our training nights. Me and her went for a walk and I thought this is great to get spending a bit of time with her. googletag.cmd.push “If it was mid-season, I wouldve been at training and Clare wouldve had the two weans.” An interview to recollect his playing career, meant hed have to go through with retirement. A warrior on the pitch, every word coming down the phone was calculated and softly spoken. In the epicentre of his dual county career, a successful battle with a groin injury forced him to pick one code. With the time needed to compete, he looked into his soul. It was the wee ball that plucked harder at his emotions. Years later, as the weeks ticked towards the  club season and with a winter of rehabbing another groin injury, he veered towards another sporting crossroads.      His sons seizures had begun. Family called. Mixing both sports wasnt going to be feasible. “I cant play any more,” he reluctantly told the football management. “It wasnt like I didnt want to, I just didnt have time. Work and home le was getting fairly hectic. I wouldve needed to have manufactured another couple of days in the week,” said Hinphey, who played senior championship football for Dungiven since he stepped out of minor until the age of  or . “In that time, I played county hurling and football, I was travelling up and down to Belfast four or five nights a week...it was tight going.”  By the time that years hurling championship came around, he missed the semi-final with Slaughtneil, a game they lost by a point. As the Derry hurling heavyweights were prodding one another in an epic at Ballinascreen, Liam and Clare were in hospital as their son took a bad seizure. “That was the first big game that I couldnt play in,” Liam said.  The nature of the defeat made it dficult to walk away. They were close. But how could he keep up the level of preparation,his sons condition needed more care  “Is it worth it, to put a full year into it,” Liam asked himself. “Championship is what you play for.” He asked again. “Is it worth another nine months of hard work to potentially not play again ” He decided to give it one last big push for the  season and was pleasantly surprised when new Derry manager John McEvoy rang him. Collie McGurk had coaxed him back out to play in the semi-final of the Christy Ring against Kildare the year before and Derry wasnt on the radar under the new boss. “I wasnt expecting John to ask me, but he did. I thought,it is going to be my last year I might as well play for the county .” Derry lost in the Christy Ring semi-final to Meath, again to the eventual winners before embarking on what he still felt was his last season of club action. “My attitude before itwas, just to give this everything. Win or lose, thats me,” Liam said.Shortly after the final, Geoffrey McGonigle asked him to meet him for a pint. Knowing Geoffrey was staying on as manager, Liam knew the gist of what was to follow. “The first words he said was  youre not playing hurling next year, Im gonna bust your face,” Hinphey laughs. “We got chatting and I said wed give it a go and see how it plays out.” His sons cluster of seizures and with Covid bringing a greater risk, Liam didnt lt a hurl until just before the semi-final win over Ballinascreen.  The lack of time to prepare made up his mind. “I know myself that I was far from my best,” he conceded, admitting that his general fitness wasnt the problem. “This year, I was trying to play with very little training behind me. Unfortunately, the way things are, I cant commit the time and effort to stay in the shape I need to be at the level I would want to play at.” Trying to topple Slaughtneil would have to be the target. He compares their professionalism to a county team. “Id love to be selfish enough to do it, to train every day...be it recovery, a gym session, swimming or just training.” Hed love the challenge, but father time didnt agree. It was time to move on. *** Along with his brothers Kieran and Kevin, Liam spent hours of their youth hurling in the garden. All-Irelands from the telly were re-enacted, with the odd flood of tears and the smash of a window pane. Their mother is Mary K Brolly, sister of the late Francie. Their sister Emer began playing camogie again in her thirties, for Bredagh in Belfast, where she won an intermediate title. Like her brother Kevin has with the Lynchs, she has followed father Liam seniors footsteps into coaching. Even though his Da was a big hurling man, Liam doesnt ever remember being forced into the game. “Da went to Croke Park for every Kilkenny game and he used to bring us since we were no height. I mustve been to Croke Park  times before I was  years of age,” he said.  Along with a group of friends, from the age of , they would spend their summers up at the Gaelic pitch, from morning to night. In between, it was just wall to wall football and hurling. His age group didnt win anything as they moved up the ranks, but playing above himself on Kevins team bore fruit. “That was a strong team. The only thing we didnt win was the U Feacuteile final,” remembers Liam, who won one of his U medals as a goalkeeper. Two minor titles followed and after losing to Ballygalget in the Ulster final in Ballinascreen, they went on better the following year to see off St Galls in the decider. “The success we had at senior level was a combination of those boys coming through. We joined in with Barry Kelly, Emmet McKeever, James Donaghy , Geoffrey, Ronie , Eddie Friel...that group. It was a really good combination of youth and experience,” Liam pointed out. It yielded seven senior championships, including one as captain in , with the last coming in . Along with Dungivens football final defeat to Loup in , Liams other disappointment was their Ulster hurling final defeat two years earlier to Dunloy. With time up, they trailed - to -, but a Paul Shiels goal saw the Antrim champions punish the Lynchs with a late - burst at Casement Park. Liam refers to their missed goal chances, but like all the defeats he takes them in his stride – mentioning them without dwelling too much. Niall Mullan handed him his senior championship debut in a  defeat by Slaughtneil in Drum, in the week of his th birthday.  “I was marking Dermot Doherty,” Hinphey recalls. “ I remember the terrible weather, it pished all night.” He had just turned  and remembers taking a drink that night for the first time. “Before that, I just didnt bother. It wasnt anything overly religious. It was the time when boys were sneaking cans, I was more afraid of Ma and Da.” Kevin Lynchs would win six of the next seven championships and, over his career, the  defeat to Banagher was one of a few he felt got away from them. “We had a goal disallowed and a few things. Its not something I sit up worrying about. I am happy enough with my lot. “There was one against Slaughtneil . They scored two goals in the last five minutes. We sort of controlled that game.” The words between Hinpheys recollections are consistent. His career was a good one, blessed with talented teams with craic and friendships along the way. It has been nine years since they won the Fr Collins Cup, but Hinphey didnt see that spell as a slog with any fall outs. “We have had good management and good setups,” he stressed. “The players put it in. They are great lads, you had  to  training every night and putting it in. Its a pity we werent more successful.” There is also the camaraderie. Niall Mullan gave him his debut and he played alongside his son Darragh. He was managed by John A Mullan and played on the same team as his sons John and Richie. “There are zero boys Ive played with, thatyou were sitting in a bar in a few years time, you wouldnt be able to have a few pints with him. It is something to be thankful for. “I am lucky enough from that point of view, to have the characters we had around the place. Thats one of the good things to take away from it.” He doesnt believe in drink bans. Teams who are driven, will find their way to balance the work and the social aspect. In his opinion, you need both. After finals it was about getting back to the town and being in each others company. First it was into McReynolds, before heading down to the Arcade. Liam felt the  final defeat to Slaughtneil was one that got away “In the earlier days wed have ended up in the Carraig Rua. Later on, it was the Tavern or Donegal Charlies,” said Hinphey, who always appreciated the Monday. “You get in early and it is the first chance the team gets to sit and have the craic together. Those days were always the best.” In recent years, without the Fr Collins Cup to show for their efforts, it was still important to unite. “You have put a lot of time into it...hours and hours,. You have to... not celebrate that you are beat, but put an exclamation mark at the end season and have a few drinks with boys to finish it out...otherwise what is the point ” Liams first taste of senior county hurling came in the  season, while still at school. After St Patricks Magheras Hogan Cup run, he didnt feature in Dominic McKinleys Ulster championship plans, but started at wing forward in an All-Ireland preliminary round two-point defeat to Kerry in Tullamore, marking his debut with a point. “I loved my times playing with Derry hurling and ultimately, thats why I didnt go back to thefootball,” Liam admits.Pulling his body between both codes told him to choose. He went for his favourite. “I would rather be playing the hurling and try to push the Derry hurling on a bit. That was the decision I made and I dont regret it one minute. “We had brilliant days, there was not as much silverware as we shouldve won, but there were some brilliant years,” he added. He has two Nicky Rackard Cup medals, but the Christy Ring Cup eluded him. The semi-final defeats of  to Kildare and the following year to Meath, his last game with the county, were as close he got. With both going on to win the final easily. “We got the final onceand it was the year we were further away. That Kerry team was very strong,” he adds. “That was always the ambition of ours. We were always good enough, but we didnt. There is nothing I sitand think we shouldve won.” Like with the club, he points to the Derry men he hurled with, who will be friends for le. “The friendships I have made over the years are more important than that sort of stuff. Big Ruairi , Breandan Quigley and Paddy Henry...all them boys.”  The WhatsApp group is an active one. “They are the friends I have and thats not to be scoffed at either. It is an important thing and I am very thankful for.” *** By his own admission, Liam Hinphey was far from being the best footballer on Dungiven underage teams. At St Patricks Maghera, he didnt play on any of the school teams after second or third year. And there werent any teachers coming knocking on the door to coax him. At the start of Upper Sixth, a requirement to pick an activity for the Wednesday afternoon sport slot and the prompt of a class mate helped him make the first step on the road to a senior inter-county football career. “It was Joe Keenan,” Hinphey begins. “He talked me into going to these Gaelic matches. I went down, started to play well.” After playing a few games for the B team in the ODoherty, Dermot McNicholl liked what he saw. “I started all thegroup games, I played half-back and ended up being moved into midfield. I ended up having to mark the main men on the other teams. I wasnt a great footballer, but I was good at stopping great footballers.” Maghera beat rivals St Marys Magherafelt in the final. In the Hogan Cup semi-final against Colaacuteiste Na Sceilge, he was asked to mark Kerrys Bryan Sheehan and James Kavanagh in the final against St Jarlaths Tuam. “Winning the Hogan Cup was brilliant,” Hinphey said. “It is a dferent build up and dferent sort of camaraderie. You are spending more time with those boys than you are with your own families, because you are at school with them for eight hours a day.” That campaign made him as a footballer and by Wednesday, Dermot McNicholl, who was also Dungivens senior manager, fired him in at centre back against Slaughtneil. That was the beginning. “The thought of playing senior wouldve been fancul”, he said of his ambitions at underage. “In terms of my football development, it wouldnt have played senior football for Dungiven or Derry without that .  Liam in football action for Dungiven  “When I was younger, I was never the paciest. Then I started to mature a bit at  or . I got a lot faster, so from half back I was able to burst forward. Before that, I was jogging about at one pace.” Paddy Crozier took over as Dungiven boss and later called Hinphey up when he became the Derry senior manager at the start of the  season. “I didnt feel out of my depth when I did go up,” he said. After wonderinghe could play at the level, the lure of Division  and pitting himself against some of the best about convinced Hinphey to answer Paddys call. “I started most of that year,” Liam recalls. He spoke of the night Oisin McConville, Stevie McDonnell and Kieran McGeeney back-boned a strong Armagh side at a packed Celtic Park. “I think we had to delay the throw-in, because there was that big a crowd...and we beat them. Days like that gave me huge confidence going forward,” Liam adds. After tailing away, Derry failed to make the league final and lay in wait for All-Ireland champions Tyrone in the championship. Derry had their homework done to a tee. There was a militant month of preparation, said Hinphey. In the build-up Crozier informed him hed be picking up Sean Cavanaghhe played in the half-forward line. The Derry boss even had Mark Lynch mimic Cavanaghs dummy at training in preparation. “It didnt do much good, I fell for the dummy a couple of minutes into the game,” Liam laughs. “But, that gives you confidence from the manager asking you to pick up a role like that. “Tyrone that day, they played into our hands. Mark Lynch went deep and Davy Harte followed him. No harm to anybody, no matteryou are All-Ireland champions or not,you leave big massive gaps in front and you have the two Bradleys playing and Big Enda, you are going to get cleaned out and thats what happened.” Derry held the Red Hands scoreless in the first half and ambushed them, before going out against Donegal in the next round. “We didnt play anywhere near what we could have. I think we put that much into the Tyrone game,” Hinphey feels. “There was a quick turnaround for the Ulster semi-final and we maybe couldnt get up to that same level.” The following season, Derry took Dublin down to the final stretch in a pulsating All-Ireland Quarter Final and in  beat Kerry in the league final. Liam and Clare then took off for an eight-month trip to Australia, where he hurled with Sydney Shamrocks. “I came backand did a Master degree and was living up in Belfast. Damian Cassidy was the Derry manager and I was back playing for Derry. James OKane was taking the hurling and my Da was helping him out, so I was trying to keep my toe in there too,” Liam explains. The groin injury flared up and it was time to decide. He chose the hurling path that took him around many a corner and as far as last month and his decision to call it a day. One hour of chatting later and Hinphey is still content. “Theres a group of us and we have been friends since  years of age and still are,” he said of those he hurled with in the club. “It was great and a childhood well lived. I couldnt have played for so longClare wasnt so selfless and happy for me to put so much into it when she was looking after the children.” Its now father time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat has remained wedged on mud flats in the local river close to Bay Road park since August . Over eight weeks later, it has become somewhat of a visitor attraction and captured the imagination of the city, with people regularly checking to seeit has finally taken to the seas again. Back in August, the Derry News discovered that the boat, named Day Dawn N , had been purchased for pound from a fisherman who didn’t want to see it decommissioned, according to the Assistant Harbour Master at Portrush. googletag.cmd.push It also came to light that the new owner was considering converting it into an Air B ’n’ B. The saying goes, ‘a high tide lts all boats’, but it appears Day Dawn is not for moving.  Pat Carlin of Foyle Search  Rescue had initially predicted that the vessel would set float again in mid-September with rainfall accounting for a higher tide. Now, in his view, the boat is in such a ‘bad position’ that it will require a larger vessel to dislodge it from the mudflats or floods which nobody wants to see because of the associated risks. Mr Carlin explained that the highest tide in the Foyle this year was about three metres and it never rises much above that. googletag.cmd.push That still wasn’t enough as the vessel is stuck solid on a bank which is visible when the tide is out. “The tide isn’t big enough to lt her,” said Mr Carlin. “We, unfortunately, don’t have the facilities even at high tide to pull her out. “You can see that she’s a trawler, and with the size our own boats, we don’t have any facilities to bring her out. “It’s a very bad position they’re in, it’s in the shallows, the water is not deep enough to float a vessel of that size. “The high tide is not lting her there, she’s stuck.     “You’re going to need a bigger boat to pull her out, I’m sure it’s possiblethe harbour were involved or someone .” As there is no immediate danger to maritime traffic ,it’s not a matter for rescue services. Mr Carlin added: “It doesn’t come under the remit of RNLI, the Coastguard or ourselves because it’s not an emergency. “We’ve done everything we can since the initial call-out to make sure they were safe and observed all the time and we do our checks every time we’re up and down the river to seeanyone is onboard. “I’m sure from a private perspectivethey wanted to employ somebody they might be able to move it but I’m not % sure.” If released from the mudflats other dangers come into play, he said, as she may be holed underneath or damaged which could mean there’s a possibility of sinking. Mr Carlin added: “If she did in the wrong place you’d have a bigger problem then. “It’s up to the captain and those onboard to decide what they want to do now. “If we had a big enough boat I’m absolutely sure we’d make an attempt to do it but we just don’t have a big enough boat. “We’ve had the maximum tide of the year so far, a . metres tide but she’s just not floating in full tide. “Unless they get a massive flood and a very high tide she looks like she’s stuck there. “As high as we’ve gone this year is .m .m and it’s not budged. “And eventhe tide is that high and you go to pull her off, she’s obviously still stuck there somewhere because she’s not moving.” He continued: “I think it has a . metre trawl which is the depth from the waterline down to the bottom of the boat. “You need a maximum of that to refloat her andyou’ve only got a m tide and she’s stuck on a bank then there’s not much manoeuvre for her to refloat. “It’s not looking good for it at the moment being there so long.” A spokesperson for Foyle Port said they are in regular contact with the owner of the boat. “He informs us that he is working on moving the boat when the conditions allow him to do so,” the spokesperson said. “The boat is not derelict nor is it a shipping, navigation or environmental risk and is anchored safely, so the responsibility is on the owner to move the boat when he can.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New housing at Wapping Lane is one offour new regeneration projects which are helping to change the face of the Fountain area of the city. Wapping Lane runs from Abercorn Road up to the Fountain. The Derry News revealed last week that full plans have been submitted to the local council for a new poundm apartment complex between Carlisle Road and the Fountain. If approved, the complex will incorporate  apartments and business space in buildings along Hawkin Street and Fountain Street. googletag.cmd.push Work is already underway to give the Cathedral Youth Club in the heart of The Fountain a facelt, and designs for a new building for the New Gate Arts and Culture Centrein Hawkin Street, which will incorporate a  seater performance space, dance studio, tuition and art rooms, as well as a cafe and rooftop terrace, are nearing completion. In addition to this, plans for a row of new two-bed homes to replace the derelict housing in Wapping Lane are due to be submitted for planning approval by local developer the Martin Group in the coming weeks. Kyle Thompson, Co-ordinator at the North West Cultural Partnership, which is based in The Fountain, said the once rundown area will become an attractive place for people to live and work. googletag.cmd.push I have been liaising with ious statutory agencies and private developers for a number of years, highlighting the need to address vacancy and dereliction in the area. Now that all the properties in Wapping Lane are under the ownership of one developer they can progress to the next stage and we hope the proposed two bedroom homes will attract people into the area to become part of this vibrant community. This area is also steeped in history and is one of oldest inhabited places in the city outside of the City Walls. Hawkin Street actually appears on some of the very first maps of the area.     For many years, the Fountains reputation was synonymous with interface attacks, but Mr Thompson believes the recent work of the North West Cultural Partnership and the New Gate Arts and Culture Centre to celebrate the history of the area has helped restore a sense of pride amongst the residents. There are a lot of misconceptions about The Fountain, but providing people with information about its history and culture and showcasing it in a positive light we can show them that this is a vibrant community that is a very attractive place to live. The Housing Executive houses here are in good condition and there is a waiting list of people wanting to get houses here. The Fountain doesnt have any antisocial activity or crime, it has a great primary school, a youth club and an arts and cultural centre so its a great place for raising a family. It would be great to see some people come back to the area or new people to come and join the community here. There is a small population and in a lot of cases kids grow up and move into the area themselves- they dont go too far. You have your family living around you and it makes the area very safe because everyone knows each other and they look out for each other.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning a wedding is a major event in anyone’s le but little did the Churchill girl think that her trip down the aisle with her intended, Eric Moore from Letterleague just outside Letterkenny, would first begin in the classroom where she works. These uncertain times have affected everyone in so many ways but you can only imagine Nicole’s shock when she got to work last Monday only to find out that the pupils and staff had a lovely surprise waiting for her. googletag.cmd.push Her wedding was due to take place in St Columbas Church, Churchill, but the new Covid- restrictions which came into force last Wednesday night meant that only six people could attend the event. The couple decided to postpone the big day as a result but Gartan principal Joanne Gildea and fellow teachers, Clare Murray and Chloe Rankin, aided and abetted by Nicole’s mum Pamela, who also works at the school as secretary, and of course the  pupils, prepared an early wedding present. “We are focusing a lot this year on wellbeing, emotional and mental health so the children decided to hold a party for Nicole last Monday morning to cheer her up. We had cake, cocktail sausages, finger food and made a presentation of flowers, choclate and a gt as well as a card signed by all the children in the school. It was quite an emotional occasion but everyone enjoyed it,” said Joanne. googletag.cmd.push As an extra bonus the school gave Nicole Friday off - well who wants to work on their wedding day  In a special message, Joanne summed up the feelings not just of the school community but the entire population in the Churchill and Gartan areas. “We thought it would be a bit harsh asking her to come on on the day she was supposed to be getting married. At Gartan NS we wish Nicole and Eric all the very best as they make new plans for their special day. We know you will be a beautul bride when you say  I do. The dficult decision to cancel will be worth it in the end.”     What a lovely start to the week by all at Gartan NS - a heartwarming and memorable gesture in these challenging times.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tylor Cartin will feature on Tricked-Out Tractors, which has brought together a dream team of petrol heads who have been restoring beloved vintage tractor models, building custom one-of-a-kind monster machines and crafting bespoke rebuilds. The Claudy woman became obsessed with cars as a child after accompanying her father to car shows and rallies and picking up tips as he worked in the garage at the house. A week after finishing school, Tylor surprised the staff at the local Ford garage by turning up to ask for a job, and she says the industry has been very welcoming overall. googletag.cmd.push When they saw a girl, they asked are you sure about this  she said. I told them this is what I wanted to do. That was about eight years ago now. Whenever I went to tech in Nutts Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Any time I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. I certainly didnt find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl and would think, can we curse in front of her  They didnt know what way to take me, but now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great. googletag.cmd.push Master mechanic Tylor will be joined in tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers on the show by restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland in County Down and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise. The Claudy woman says the trio work well together on the show. Were all on the same wave. I think its because were all in the same state of mind, were interested in what were working on and what we want the tractors to finish up like, she said. Theres nothing hugely challenging because between the three of us we are able to work things out together. If someone is struggling with one thing, the other two jump in.     Tylor, Darren and Stephen on the show. The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series. All done while taking on the pressures of hard to get parts and dficult deadlines. Viewers will see the team go wild with paint schemes, get hands on with engine upgrades, have fun out and about go karting, and getting inspiration from a custom car show. From an almost -year-old Fordson, to a champion winning pulling tractor and a classic red Porsche, the TOT workshop has been graced with some of the most sought after tractors around. In the first programme, to be aired on Monday evening, Irish tractor pulling champ, Darren Bailey brings in his monster powerhouse machine, The Challenger, so the team can help him get it into shape for the new season. With three All-Ireland Championships under his belt, this time he needs to make sure his tractor is bigger and better to hold onto his title. Tylor describes the scenes viewers will witness on Monday night as being a real learning experience. I liked working on Darrens tractor, it had a lorry engine on it, she said. To have a mix between that and the tractor, that was amazing. It was all custom made and Im really into that. It was just a complete learning curve. Even the tractor pulling sport itself and the standards they have to keep themselves, to keep within the rules thats all stuff nobody knows unless you do the actual taking part. The first episode of Tricked Out Tractors will be on BBC One NI at .pm.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Leon O’Laeartaigh lives at Foxhill in the Waterside. Every day, he goes for a walk along the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. He takes a litter picker and some bags with him to collect rubbish as he walks. He sometimes also stops to trim overgrown hedges in the area. They are small gestures, but ones, Leons neighbours say, which are making a big dference in the area. In tribute to the local mans efforts, one of his neighbours, Anaeleigh McCormick, put a post on Facebook about him on Friday and it received a huge response. googletag.cmd.push Anaeleigh described Leon as a great wee man. “Leon worked for many years in Tesco and has been retired a few years,” she said. “He was a daily gym attender until Covid arrived with us. He may well fall into the category of being vulnerable to Covid. “He could have retreated to his home and waited for this storm of le to pass. However that’s not how he is. “Leon decided that it was important that he continue his exercise every day and so took to walking the Strabane Old Road and Woodside Road. “Many would say that golf is a good walk destroyed but Leon noticed the amount of litter that lay on our paths and so ordered his stick for lting litter. He happily spoiled his daily walk and has been lting every day since, some days he tells me that he can get up to three bagfuls. googletag.cmd.push “As the appearance of the area began to improve and the summer months were with us, Leon took to trimming the hedges.“He has become the caretaker of our community.” Anaeleigh said Leon had a simple reason for doing what he does. “When I asked him what he was doing he said I’m lting the area up. “Single handedly, one piece of litter at a time, this is what he is doing. “He said you seeyou improve the area a little bit at a time it lts everyone up and everyone starts to contribute. Everyone starts taking better care of their own gardens and properties.     “He told me that a few young people in their foolishness had spoiled a planted area and that he felt it was better to fix it up again. “He started at it himself and a few neighbours then joined him and they ed it to its former glorynot better. You see it helps everyone he said and the young people seen it was important to everyone.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The grant would be available to people who are unable to work because they have been told to self-isolate due to close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-. SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan, who is the partys Social Justice spokesperson, said he was disappointed with a response from the Department for Communities to an Assembly question calling for aself-isolationsupport grant for Northern Ireland, in line with counterparts in the UK. Mr Durkan said: “We remain the only devolved administration not to offer this crucial grant. googletag.cmd.push By makingself-isolationfinancially unviable we run the risk of putting people in the desperate situation of choosing between protecting others from the risk of Covid- or providing for themselves and their families. Mr Durkan said the Department of Communities had responded to his question with a vague acknowledgement that the grant will remain ‘under review’ and signposting instead to the Discretionary Support Grant. This non-repayable living expense grant, which I have no doubt has helped many throughout the pandemic, has marked limitations. Most notably the eligibility criteria states that a household cannot earn in excess of pound,, locking many families out of critical financial assistance. googletag.cmd.push “People cannot afford dither and delay when it comes toself-isolationsupport, this is something which needs introduced with immediate effect - as has been the case in England, Scotland and Wales. It would now appear the North will lose out on this important scheme. The circuit breaker has placed Northern Ireland under some of the most stringent restrictions on these islands. People who are doing the right thing byself-isolating to prevent the spread of the virus should not have to do so to the detriment of their finances.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Setanta Construction specialises in the design, manufacture and construction of a wide range of timber frame homes. It has secured new contracts with two famous hotels, Claridges Hotel in London and the Chateau la Coste hotel in France. As a result, the company will be creating  new jobs at its workshop in Magherafelt. Mark Gribbin, Director of Setanta, said it was a sign of the local companys growing reputation in the construction world. “Following great success in the Northern Ireland market in recent years, we knew that we could go even further and grow our business in GB and Europe,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We identied a niche in the construction market and through Invest NI’s RD support, we have developed a new large construction components design, which enables us to construct the components in Magherafelt, and then deliver and install them on site. “It may seem simple to many but our customers are delighted as it enables us to move on and off site quickly and can aid in the construction of a building very quickly.” Mr Gribbin said the new manufacturing process as helped them secure the new projects. “Following our success with Claridges Hotel in London, our most recent project in France was designed by one of the world’s leading architects, Richard Rogers Architecture, who has worked on projects including the George Pompidou centre in Paris and the Lloyds building in London. googletag.cmd.push “Interestingly, we were able to organise and win our most recent deals in France using Zoom and hope to do more of this in the future. “Word is spreading quickly and we notice a marked increase with enquiries for our services and look forward to recruiting and welcoming new staff to our team.” Invest NI has offered Setanta pound, of support towards the creation of the new jobs. Dr Vicky Kell, Invest Northern Ireland’s Director of Innovation, Research  Development, said Setanta was already well established in the Northern Ireland market and recognised that in order to increase export sales, it needed to develop new solutions by investing in research and development.     “Our RD support has assisted the company to develop a unique new off-site solution, a dormer window system. “The dormer windows are fully manufactured and assembled in its workshop, transported fully built to site, and bolted into the main structure of a building. “This has reduced the company’s time spent on site from weeks to hours, reducing cost and has signicantly increased Setanta’s productivity. “Investing in RD to develop such an innovative product has provided a unique competitive advantage for Setanta and has enabled the company to win signicant contracts, most recently in Great Britain with Claridges Hotel in London and in France with Chateau la Coste. “Due to the uplt in business, we are also supporting Setanta to welcome  new staff to its team to help keep up with demand. “The company is an excellent example of recognising the importance of investing in RD to maintain a competitive business beyondCOVID-, helping to build resilience and grow,” added the Invest NI representative.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two people in the car and the driver of the bus were taken to hospital.Twelve pupils were on board the bus with two treated at the scene by paramedics with a third taken to hospital with non-le threatening injuries.

That road can be a slippery one at times and there have been a few accidents on it before.Cllr Gallagher also praised the quick response of the emergency services including the air ambulance. He said that once again the service ldquohad come up trumps by taking the most seriously injured teenager to the hospital.ldquoThey really did a fantastic job along with all the other emergency services, he added.Translink has confirmed it is working with the PSNI into finding out the circumstances of the accident.Police, who have issued a fresh appeal for information, are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the accident or was travelling along the Downpatrick Road at the time and may have captured dashcam footage.They want to hear from anyone who may have seen the car before the collision with the bus and what the road conditions were like at the time.Anyone who can assist is asked to contact officers on the non-emergency  number, quoting reference    ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Camogs.jpg","title":"Camogs lift Ulster Intermediate title  ","story":"A LATE burst of scoring from Down saw them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the Ulster Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Pearse Ogs, Armagh.Armagh had looked set to be crowned champions when they held a - to - lead after  minutes.However the Mourne girls rallied and went on to deservedly claimed a first ever provincial title at this level.Going into the match, Armaghrsquos main threat looked to come from players such as the Donnelly sisters, Rachel Merry and Ciara Hill. But Down had troopers who stood up to the challenge and excelled.Neisha McCullough was superb in thwarting the danger. As well as that, Lauren Clarke and Isabella OrsquoHare worked tirelessly for the cause and kept their opponents occupied throughout.Erin Rafferty and Olivia Boyle also battled stoically for Down and were instrumental in the teamrsquos superiority at the business end of this contest.Manager Derek Dunne was delighted with the overall performance. ldquoWe had a very young side out there, he said.ldquoNo one was over the age of , and to be honest that maybe showed a bit in the first half when we took the wrong option a few times.ldquoIn the second half we created a lot more chances, but it wasnrsquot really until close to the end that we made that count on the scoreboard.Dunne added that the result will do wonders for his team in the long run. ldquoI thought we worked the ball well right throughout that match.

Despite constant promises from the EA and their contractors we are still no closer to getting this issue resolved.ldquoConsidering the number of our parents who will be losing their jobs during this crisis it is unconscionable that those being paid a regular salary are failing to deliver a service.On Friday Education Minister Peter Weir visited The High School in Ballynahinch where he opened a new ICT suite and met with staff and pupils.Mr Weir visited classrooms and spoke with the pupils, asking about how they were operating in bubbles.The board of governors and the principal, Mr Paul Marks, also had a chance for a meeting about the new mid-term arrangements and how this would affect the pupils.Mr Marks said afterwards: ldquoToday was a chance for the Minister of Education to see how schools are operating under Covid and the arrangements we have put in place to allow safe teaching and learning for our pupils.ldquoI am really pleased to have Minister Weir here as I got to show off just what a wonderful school we have and how great our children are. I am really proud of what we have achieved here and hope for even greater things to come.A number of other local principals have commented on the extended Halloween break.Mr Joe McCann, principal of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, said the timing of the closure would appear to be appropriate, given the rising number of Covid- cases throughout Northern Ireland.lsquoWe have been extremely busy to ensure that the school is a safe place for staff and pupils. We have tried to keep the school fully operational and have been working closely with the Public Health Agencyto deal with the cases that have presented, he remarked.ldquoWe would like to thank our parents for their patience and understanding in responding so promptly to communication from the school and PHA during these challenging times.ldquoI want to pay tribute to our students, particularly those taught in bubbles, who have coped admirably with the lsquonew normalrsquo. For our Key Stage  pupils, the break is welcome.Mr McCann continued: ldquoHowever, while the timing is right from a public health perspective, the Ministerrsquos announcement last Friday regarding exam arrangements, specically concerning GCSE Maths and GCSE English, has heightened anxiety among pupils, parents and staff as they work to prepare for an exam in January.ldquoI also want to pay tribute to my staff for their continued effort through what has been the most challenging time in their careers. Their work in creating a safe learning environment has been tremendous.Mrs Maud Perry, principal of Down High School, described the current situation as ldquoconcerning and hoped that the transmission of the virus will reduce as a result of this extended half-term.ldquoMy main hope is that everyone in the school community remains safe, she said. ldquoIt is important that all people in the district do their utmost to comply with regulations and act in a socially responsible way.ldquoThis has been an especially dficult start to the school year and I want to commend my colleagues for the very professional and dedicated way in which they have coped with a wholly dferent school experience.ldquoThere are many uncertainties at present, not least the situation in relation to public examinations. I hope the awarding bodies provide clear and helpful guidance to teachers, pupils and parents as a matter of urgency. The lack of clarity to date has heightened anxiety for young people, parents and teachers.Mrs Perry added: ldquoSchools have worked extremely hard to welcome pupils back to structured face-to-face learning experiences and pupils were thoroughly enjoying their school experience, albeit it very dferent.ldquoI really hope that we canto what we do best after this lsquocircuit breakerrsquo. Children do need to be in school for so many social, emotional and educational reasons and I hope that we canenergised on November .Mr Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, also welcomed the extended Halloween break and said students deserved a ldquomuch-needed rest from the pressures of school le.He continued: ldquoThe mental impact of Covid- on our young people cannot be underestimated at this time and we need to look after them.ldquoNow is the time for students to breathe again and to look after themselves before ing to school on November . We would encourage all our young people to adhere to public health guidelines during this period.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle High School in Downpatrick, said the school had adhered to official guidance to mitigate risk and keep everyone safe.ldquoWhile our pupils welcome and deserve the extended break for Halloween, it canrsquot be said for us as a school and for other schools in the community, who were preparing to continue teaching remotely, he said.Mr Maguire said that from next week, students would be encouraged to log on to continue their studies, ldquoirrespective of the Ministerrsquos advice.He continued: ldquoWe have allocated a large number of IT devices to enable our children to engage and we continue to source these devices to ensure no one misses out.Mr Maguire said thatschools could not reopen, Mr Weir should allow them to teach remotely.ldquoWhile there is nothing like face to face teaching, itrsquos the best option as opposed to a further extension to the break, he continued. ldquoSchools are under immense pressure to deliver content and prepare not only for GCSE GCE exams, but to educate children as a whole in a very tight window.ldquoI would welcome DE CCEA to look at this urgently, the current changes are not near enough. Children are anxious and worried. A bold decision needs to be made in respect to how schools prepared for exams.ldquoIt seems no one is listening to those people on the ground, in the classroom working with children, delivering two year programmes and trying to deal with Covid.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe have a considerable number of pupils sitting GCSE science papers on their . They are not being prepared the way I want them to be prepared, how others previous to them were prepared. They are not getting a fair chance at this exam paper but yet weare told to continue aseverything is normal. Itrsquos not good enough.Mr Stephen Taylor, principal of Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, expressed his concern about the loss of learning for students.However, he believed the welfare of all students and the wider community was the priority and the decision to close schools on the basis of medical advice was correct.ldquoIn Blackwater Integrated College during the past eight weeks much work has been done to ensure staff and students are set up for remote learning through Google Classroom for an eventuality such as this, he said.lsquolsquoWe have made sure all students have access to Google Classroom from home should this period of closure extend beyond the two weeks by lending out iPads to many students and working closely with students to ensure they have access to high quality online learning.He added: rsquorsquoBlackwater has been fortunate as a school that no member of the school community has tested positive since restart and I commend everyone associated with the college for their hard work in ensuring a safe environment for all.rsquorsquoMr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar, said he recognised Covid- had greatly impacted on the entire school community.ldquoWe are determined to help all our pupils bridge the educational gap they have suffered since closing in March, whilst also supporting their emotional and social needs, he said.ldquoWe understand the frustration of families with schools closing but this decision is an attempt to keep all members of our school safe and avoid longer closures.ldquoOur Year  pupils are due to sit exams in the November series however, we have had no update from the Minister of Education on contingency plans. I am genuinely concerned as to what will happenwe do notin November ora pupil, or whole class, have to self-isolate.ldquoI am also frustrated at the Ministerrsquos response regarding the summer exams. The expectation to sit full GCSE courses in a number of subjects, including Maths, having missed face to face teaching for four months, places further pressure on pupils.ldquoOur pupils are important to all of us as iniduals, we know their hopes and aspirations and aim to help them achieve these. They are not simply another number or statistic.Mr Hanna continued: ldquoAs principal, I feel we are fighting not only the virus, but the decisions from the Minister of Education who, rather than supporting, is pushing against us. The gates of St Colmcillersquos may be closed for a while. However, we will continue to support all our pupils through online resources.ldquoWe have ensured all pupils have access to Google Classroom and online Maths programmes whilst providing tutorial videos to help our parents understand how pupils access these.He added: ldquoSt Colmcillersquos High School will continue to support all our pupils, parents and staff during and after this closure, working together to prioritise our pupils.Shimna Integrated College principal, Mr Kevin Lambe, said the school would be treating the two-week closure as a holiday.ldquoWe know our staff and students, especially Years  and  who have been back since August , are more than ready for a real rest, he said.ldquoOur support staff and premises staff have been back for even longer and teachers were working away preparing for this very strange year. The two weeks are holiday and schools will not be delivering remote learning.ldquoHowever, staff have shared with students ideas for good things to do during the circuit breaker and have provided guidance to help our examination year students to take the initiative and make good use of their time.

Province-wide, a total of  dogs were euthanised last year, with Ards and North Down Council the only local authority not to destroy any animals.Councils do not have powers to seize dogs from homes or euthanise legally dangerous animals without a court order, while people whose dog strays and is seized by a council dog warden could receive a warning or fixed penalty fine.Last week, local politicians supported a proposal to examine why the number of dogs the council destroys is so high, with the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreeing that officials consult with both animal charities and local police.Councillors say they are keen for the PSNI to crack down on puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown said there should be ldquoextreme concern that substantially more dogs are put down in the local council area and is pleased that the local authority is to work with others to reduce the number of dogs it destroys after backing a motion he tabled on the issue.It urged council officials to consider ways they can bring together strategic partners such as dog wardens, local kennels, animal welfare officers, police and animal rescue charities to address the issue, including through tackling the illegal and unethical breeding and sale of dogs, particularly online.Cllr Brown described the number of dogs the local authority destroys as ldquoparticularly worrying considering the recent increase in dog theft and illegal puppy farms.He said while there are always situations where a dog may need to be put down due to ill health, efforts should be taken to keep the number of animals euthanised as low as possible.ldquoEven many old or aggressive dogs who are often put down can lead fulfilling lives under the right circumstances, usually with the help of specialist animal charities, continued Cllr Brown.ldquoUnfortunately, Newry, Mourne and Down Council sends less than five percent of its dogs to animal charities while in most other areas itrsquos between  and %. In addition, the local authority sells % of them to the public while in other areas itrsquos around %.Commending local dog kennels for finding homes for so many dogs, Cllr Brown believes that by working more closely with animal charities, the council could reduce the number of unwanted dogs and subsequently the number that are put down.ldquoI am pleased that the council can begin to work strategically to find a forever home for every dog possible, regardless of age or disposition, and am pleased that officials will consult with animal charities on how the number of dogs euthanised can be reduced, he said, also welcoming a commitment to work with police to halt puppy farming and illegal breeding establishments.Cllr Brown said he was also concerned that many other local councils in Northern Ireland had not claried why figures for the number of dogs they destroy are so low.He added: ldquoI am worried there is a lack of transparency in how some councils report their numbers as many did not write back to Newry, Mourne and Down Council when asked for clarity on how they manage unwanted dogs. Whilst this doesnrsquot excuse our districtrsquos overly high figures, it does bring into question why other areas are so low.ldquoI would like to see all un-homed dogs who are healthy enough not to be put down found a home, eventhat is with a specialist charity which can deal with dangerous or aggressive animals. I hope to see progress and a reduction in the number of dogs euthanised in our area in the months ahead and I look forward to working with the council to achieve this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down hurlers’ victory over Derry secures promotion  ","story":"FOR several years, Down have made it to the door of NHL Division A, only to miss out on entry at the final stage.However on Sunday, they finally gained promotion courtesy of victory over Derry at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh.Down boss Ronan Sheehan and his charges have come so close in recent times, without taking that final step.On Sunday, all that was forgotten, as they got their hands on the cup and the ticket to the higher stage.ldquoTo finally get over the line means everything, Sheehan beamed afterwards. ldquoWe made a big decision this weekend in the U-s when we didnrsquot play Phelim Savage and Ronan Costello.ldquoThat was probably what proved to be the dference today. They proved here A is where they really want to be.ldquoA lot of credit must go to Sean Og McAteer and and Jack Devaney for that performance.

This victory is as much about them as it is about us. Hopefully all the clubs in the intermediate and the juniors will reap the benefits of this promotion in the next number of years.A big factor in Downrsquos success in this encounter was the performance of the Sands brothers, Eoghan and Daithi.Their perpetual motion display and sharpness saw them land - of Downrsquos overall total between them.Eoghan found the back of the net after just  minutes and gave Down the lead for the first time after the Oak Leaf county led through scores from Cormac Doherty and Eamonn Magill.The sides were level twice in the first half.

officer almost certainly saved the womanrsquos le.They have also confirmed thatshe had not survived the attack on her two-storey home, they would have launched a murder inquiry.The modest fire officer who has been branded a hero by people in the Listooder Park area, says he did what anyone  would have done.When he arrived at the womanrsquos home she was trapped in her bedroom as choking black smoke engulfed the stairway, preventing her escape.Mr Crossett, who was the duty officer for the area last weekend, raced to the scene of the blaze ahead of local fire crews and as he did so, a fire officer based in Lisburn talked to the woman on the telephone in a bid to keep her calm and assure her help was on the way.He said: ldquoI managed to alert some neighbours and one of them was able to get me a ladder which I then climbed up to help lower the woman to safety before she was taken to the Downe Hospital.DOWNPATRICK mdash Highly dangerous illegal fireworks circulating in the area could kill or cause serious injury, Downpatrickrsquos police chief has warned.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan, has this week confirmed that teenagers across the district are gaining access to a proleration of dangerous fireworks, many of which do not meet current safety standards.The police chiefrsquos warning comes a matter of days after a post box at the Saul Road in Downpatrick was blown apart by a lethal banger, believed to have been imported from Germany.The device was placed inside the box by three teenagers who were spotted running away and when the banger exploded, large chunks of metal and letters were hurled into the air.Mr McGuigan confirmed police believe the fireworks are finding their way into the district through a iety of sources and revealed the majority of those being sold do not meet current British safety standards.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Regeneration officials in Ballynahinch have this week claimed a major new planning document backs their campaign for the construction of a bypass around the town.They are convinced the so-called draft issues paper, which has been produced to help formulate the new areas plan for Down District, makes it clear that Ballynahinch has a greater need than Downpatrick for a bypass.They are still seething at Down Councilrsquos decision to push for by-passes for both towns, a move they believe is tantamount to disaster and will almost certainly result in both schemes never being constructed.However, the publication of the new planning paper has given them renewed hope because it makes it quiet clear that while a by-pass is not the

councillors claiming they have the backing of residents and others saying residents are opposed.At Monday nightrsquos client services committee meeting, Mr Billy Alexander claimed he had received numerous objections to the goalposts.Mr Alexander said he had been contacted by three families who felt the posts were too close to houses lining the field.Calling for an immediate consultation regarding the play area, he said the older children were now attracted to the kick about area and this was also bothering residents.However, Mr Patsy Toman said the family who lived closest to the

I fear for the industrythe current lockdown is extended.Equally concerned is Stephen Magorrian, co-owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, who warned of ldquocarnagevenues were not allowed to reopen in December.Under the new restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive the entire hospitality sectors is closed apart from food deliveries and takeaways.Speaking yesterday, Mrs McCaugherty said it was a ldquovery stressful time for owners, staff and customers.ldquoItrsquos a case of here we go again. I know itrsquos nobodyrsquos fault, but we canrsquot keep going on like this, she said. ldquoWe were due to hold a wedding reception here today, but it had to be cancelled. To be told the previous Friday that you canrsquot have your wedding is just dreadful.ldquoWe have had to move dates for other weddings, but we will lose a signicant amount of business.Mrs McCaugherty said all of the Millbrookrsquos  full and part-time staff were currently being furloughed, apart from some administrative staff.ldquoWe are a family run hotel and one of the biggest employers in Ballynahinch. We try to look after our staff and treat them like a family. I appreciate how dficult it must be for them.ldquoThis is a bigger blow to them than the lockdown in March. They canrsquot believe it is happening again.Mrs McCaughtery said the hospitality industry was being unfairly treated compared with other sectors of the economy.ldquoI think there is a sprinkling of unfairness in all of this, she continued. ldquoWhy, for example, can you go into a shop and move around the place, but are not permitted to come into a pub or restaurant and have something to eat or drink ldquoWe have done everything that was required of us and more. Before we reopened in July we put in sanitising stations and observed correct distancing all the other guidelines. We went above and beyond what was asked.ldquoBusiness was good after the reopening. We had lots of staycations and overnight stays. The East Out to Help Out in August proved busy, as it was for our sister hotel, the Ivanhoe, in Carryduff.ldquoWe introduced live outdoor music, which people enjoyed even in slightly cold weather. People need to be together and are providing more than just food and drink.Mrs McCaugherty praised the support offered by Hospitality Ulster and the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, which, she said, could not have been more helpful.She was also hopeful of better times ahead. ldquoThis is definitely the most challenging time I can remember. But have worked and lived through the Troubles and I am confident we can get through this, she said.ldquoNext year is building up to be busy, which is great. We have to be positive.Mr Magorrian said the closure was ldquodisappointing but somewhat understandable given the rise in the number of Covid- cases.However, he warned that the industry could not survive many more lockdowns.He said the current closure was more dangerous than the one earlier in the year because of changes in the Governmentrsquos furloughing scheme, which would place a greater demand on employers meeting the cost of staff wages.ldquoI hope that everyone sticks to the guidelines this time. It is essential that everyone does their bit so that we can open for business in December and over Christmas, he said.ldquoIf we do not get that business then it will be carnage in January and many establishments will not survive. An extended lockdown would be catastrophic.Mr Magorrian said he is concerned about the future of some so-called lsquowetrsquo pubs which do not serve food and were only permitted to reopen a few weeks ago.ldquoWe were able to open in July and that brought some money in. But the wet pubs have only been open a few weeks. I fear for themthey do not get some business in.Mr Magorrian said all  staff at Denvirrsquos, which is part of the Horatio Group, were currently furloughed.ldquoOur staff are our number one priority, but we are at the mercy of the Government. There is nothing we can do. We need the Governmentrsquos support.He added: ldquoThis is nobodyrsquos fault, but people need to take the situation seriously..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21st October 2020 Leisure.jpg","title":"Leisure centre to be lit up blue for 75th anniversary of United Nations  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre in Downpatrick will be illuminated with blue lighting next month to mark the th anniversary of the UnitedNations.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Laura Devlin will throw the switch on November  to commemorate the signing of the UN Charter in San Francisco in .Soon after the end of the Second World War, nations across the globe decided to change the course of history and took the commitment to work together for peace.

Instead, the committee asked the government department to carry out restocking which it has thus far failed to do.Cllr Curran believes that a restocked river, in tandem with enhanced angling facilities, would attract local, national and international anglers.He says the river is a key tourism asset but has not had signicant amounts of money invested in it over recent years, suggesting that the waterway has the potential to become of the key jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown.ldquoThe Quoile offers so much potential and there is much scope to invest in this fantastic facility, Cllr Curran continued.He added: ldquoAngling is very much part of the tourism offering in South Down. It is an important recreational sport and the Downpatrick river could be transformed with more investment and restocking.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that at some point in the future it could host a major angling competition.

I was a little bit more patient in the game with Carrick.ldquoWhen Nav [Navid Nasseri] cut down from the left for my third goal, I would usually have been busting to get into the six yard box, but instead I hung back and when the ball came in, I tried to direct away the goalkeeper as much as I could.ldquoThe first two goals were really well-worked. Kirk Millar and Conor Pepper combined well down the right for both. Conor played the ball exactly where it needed to be for my second.Waterworth said with football having been missing from local fansrsquo for so long, the Blues were keen to put on a show last weekend.ldquoThe fans havenrsquot seen any action at Windsor for a long time, so we wanted to perform well here. Irsquom playing in a really good team and getting plenty of chances.There are four of us playing for that number nine position.

Irsquoll not be too hard on myself but.The early signs for this season once more bode ominously for the Blues rivals in the battle to land the Gibson Cup once more. However Waterworth thinks they can get even better.ldquoWe are good when we keep the ball and play through teams. Carrick are a tough team to play against, but we gave them the chance to grow into the game.ldquoWe worked hard to establish the early lead and I donrsquot know whether some of us took the foot off the gas a bit after that.It is something we must recty going forward but. We canrsquot afford to do that, because teams will hurt us.ldquoThere is no question we became complacent once we went two up. We were not picking up second balls, and they began to hurt us so that is a lesson.The Bluesrsquo Killyleagh-born manager, David Healy, paid tribute to evergreen Waterworth after his match-winning feat.ldquoAndy does that. He pops up in the right areas, and again Andyrsquos goal ratio over the last three, four, five years since I have been here has been just incredible.ldquoI think actually in that time, his all-round game has improved in the last  months to two years.Hopefully we can keep adding goals to Andyrsquos tally here.Waterworth will hope to keep his great start to the season going when the champions go to former boss David Jeffreyrsquos Ballymena United in the Danske Bank Premiership this Saturday.The former Northern Ireland U- international, who previously had spells at Ards, Lisburn Distillery, Hamilton Academicals and Glentoran, first came to prominence during a successful spell in the Amateur League with Kilmore Rec.The striker scored the opening two goals on Saturday after he got on the end of crosses supplied by Conor Pepper.A Caolan Loughran penalty for Rangers reduced the gap to - at half-time.

The subtext to this was ‘so why worry ’The RHI scandal was bad enough, but now we have the latest scandal over wind turbines where, officials and politicians in Northern Ireland once again defied the norm to keep us out of line with the scheme in the rest of the UK. The outcome of this was a subsidy which dwarfs the benefit renewable energy produced. It is estimated that this action has led to £ million a year cost to UK consumers.These two scandals have been seen by some as incompetence, by others as outworkings of an economic nationalism of not only Sinn Fein but also the DUP. Tellingly, no minister has fallen on their sword over these scandals which, had they occurred where in the UK would have undoubtedly been the case. Nor has any civil servant ever had to account for them.I do not believe these economic disasters for the UK will be forgotten. As a small region we have cost the nation dearly and amidst a rising tide of regional sentiment in England, Scotland and Wales, the DUP may well have presided over the fracturing of the Union as we know it. The lack of contrition speaks volumes.Thomas Robinson JP, Larne——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Growing up, his dad had more than one knocking about the yard – with Aaron himself all too keen to get into the driving seat any chance he could get.As he grew up, the interest in tractors remained – and he wasn’t just looking the top range vehicles, vintage was just as cool. This was the philosophy when he spotted a model rusting away in the hedge of a fellow enthusiast’s yard one day.A tractor swap later would reveal this old model to be a unique  Fordson F with a strange three-point linkage system.This was something dferent, but it desperately needed fixing upit was to hit the road again.That’s where the Tricked Out Tractor team come in – but will they be able to teach an old engine new tricks while still keeping it’s vintage feel And when owner Aaron from County Armagh shows them an interesting signature on the side of the tractor the gang call in an expert to find outthe tractor could be worth a lot of money.Together master mechanic Tylor Cartin from Claudy, County Londonderry restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland, County Down, and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise have been tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers.The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series. All done while taking on the pressures of hard to get parts and dficult deadlines.Viewers will see the team go wild with paint schemes, get hands on with engine upgrades, have fun out and about go karting, and getting inspiration from a custom car show.From an almost -year-old Fordson, to a champion winning pulling tractor and a classic red Porsche, the TOT workshop has been graced with some of the most sought after tractors around.Tylor Cartin said: “In this series I’m the chief mechanic technician. I do the engine work, anything mechanical on the tractor that needs replaced. You have to have a strong backbone, but I just have had so much craic working with the guys.Stephen Lennon said: “This series is something new and completely dferent. It has big entertainment value and you might just learn something about tractors and the history of tractors too!”Darren Bailey said: “It’s amazing how we have taken tractors destined for the scrapheap and transformed them into basically shiny new shoes again.”The final programme, Cruisin’ In My ‘, a family heirloom tractor is now in the hands of -year-old Jason McVerry from Belleeks, County Armagh, who wants to have it tricked out. For this International , new metalwork, windows, and doors are just the beginning of the transformation.

What are the memories they treasure to this day ”For Martin Charters of the tiny village of Shrigley, Co Down, growing up during the Great Depression meant make-do-and-mend.He did not even have shoes, and was forced to improvise a pair by cutting up some old wellies he found in a dump.The dole office also packed him off to work on a farm from am to pm each day.He went on to serve in a Lancaster bomber squadron during World War Two, manning the tailgun.“You did nothing but sit and pray: Oh Lord save me! And shaking,” he said.Meanwhile Aileen Pollock, from Belfast, recalled emigrating to Hong Kong in the s – a journey that took six weeks by boat.Bizarrely, she encountered Fred Astaire in the flesh during a trip to a nightclub there – “but he had brown shoes on [with an evening suit] – and I didn’t think they looked nice”.Mairead Liddy, of Warrenpoint, had moved to London, and helped man an ambulance at the time of the Blitz.“The bombings were very bad. You don’t have any fear when you’re young.”What partition meant for their family was reduced business, because one of the first acts of the new government was to end Sunday trading in their pub.“My father thought in his young days,he had his own wee pub, he’d be flying,” she said.“He bought the pub. In those days you could have opened on a Sunday.“But when partition came, the first thing they did when the put in the new government was to stop all trading on Sunday.“My mother never forgave them. She’d look out and see the people coming down from Belfast for the day, and went across in wee boats to Omeath in the other part of Ireland!”Eileen Sweeney, from Fermanagh, recalled being given her first car, and driving around the countryside trying to catch people working who were also claiming sickness benefits.“I was very far from popular at that stage!” she said.The show moved through the trials and tribulations of the war years, through the Troubles, and up to the present day.Two of the interviewees have died before the broadcast: Aileen Pollock, and Isobel Lavery, originally from the loyalist Shankill part of Belfast.The latter revealed what could be the secret to her longevity: she had never once tried alcohol, and never once tried a cigarette.

The common principles of engines are all the same, you can’t go too far wrong there.“My daddy was always big into his cars and lorries, I was reared in the shed beside him, picking up the tips and curse words.”Tylor’s father Micky is a lorry driver who does all his own mechanical work.She said: “Whenever I said about being a mechanic, my daddy said, ‘your back will be broke and your head will be fried’. He wasn’t trying to put me off, he was just speaking from experience. “I absolutely love it. Yes, it’s a very male dominated profession, but I have had no hassle in any way because I’m female, or anybody giving my grief about it. Everybody has been so encouraging.”Tylor said she was used to being in male company: “Whenever I went to tech in Nutt’s Corner, I was, bar the dinner lady, the only girl in the whole tech. Anytime I went for my lunch, the dinner lady came in and sat with me. “I certainly didn’t find it intimidating, but it took the boys a long time to get used to me. They saw a girl, and would think, ‘can we curse in front of her ’“They didn’t know what way to take me. However now, people are so accepting of a woman in the trade, which is great.”Tylor’s boyfriend Jamie is a contractor who works with heavy machinery.She said: “He’s machinery mad, the bigger the better. We’ve a wild lot in common. I tell him he’s lucky because most girls wouldn’t want to go with him to sht a digger.”Read More Read MoreNew artwork encourages people to explore Belfast’s ancient entriesSeries producer Zoe McGivern from Green Inc said: “We were looking at the rural world and saw that this was a really big thing, people were putting a lot of money into their tractors, restoring old tractors or blinging out new tractors. It’s not the case that tractors are only for farmers, we’ve seen a wide range or people who own tractors.She continued: “In terms of the casting we set out contacting a lot of the trade magazines, getting tips on who to speak to.“We went out and met a few people. Our guys stood out. They all knew their stuff really well, they had big personalities, I knew they’d get on like a house on fire. They were an absolute pleasure to work with.“Tylor is a master mechanic, she knows her stuff inside out, Stephen has got so much experience with the vintage stuff, restoring classic tractors, Darren is our machinery specialist, he is the man with all the contacts, he’ll find any part you need. They make the perfect team.”Of the three-part series she said: “While there’s tractors at the heart, it’s also a makeover series – the type of thing that anyone can enjoy.”The series, filmed mainly before current Covid- restrictions, begins on BBC One Northern Ireland tonight at .pm.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Growing up, his dad had more than one knocking about the yard – with Aaron himself all too keen to get into the driving seat any chance he could get.As he grew up, the interest in tractors remained – and he wasn’t just looking the top range vehicles, vintage was just as cool. This was the philosophy when he spotted a model rusting away in the hedge of a fellow enthusiast’s yard one day.A tractor swap later would reveal this old model to be a unique  Fordson F with a strange three-point linkage system.This was something dferent, but it desperately needed fixing upit was to hit the road again.That’s where the Tricked Out Tractor team come in – but will they be able to teach an old engine new tricks while still keeping it’s vintage feel And when owner Aaron from County Armagh shows them an interesting signature on the side of the tractor the gang call in an expert to find outthe tractor could be worth a lot of money.Together master mechanic Tylor Cartin from Claudy, County Londonderry restoration guru Stephen Lennon from Loughbrickland, County Down, and machinery expert Darren Bailey from Portlaoise have been tackling mechanical mess ups and major makeovers.The trio have worked on complicated tractor builds, ground up restorations, and cutting edge designs in this new one of a kind resto-mod series.

I do the engine work, anything mechanical on the tractor that needs replaced. You have to have a strong backbone, but I just have had so much craic working with the guys.Stephen Lennon said: “This series is something new and completely dferent. It has big entertainment value and you might just learn something about tractors and the history of tractors too!”Darren Bailey said: “It’s amazing how we have taken tractors destined for the scrapheap and transformed them into basically shiny new shoes again.”The final programme, Cruisin’ In My ‘, a family heirloom tractor is now in the hands of -year-old Jason McVerry from Belleeks, County Armagh, who wants to have it tricked out. For this International , new metalwork, windows, and doors are just the beginning of the transformation.

AP Photo INA, POOL, fileA new BBC documentary retells the story of a group of labourers from Northern Ireland who found themselves stranded in Iraq after they went there to fit out Saddam Hussein’s palace.When the painters and decorators were in Baghdad in  the Iraqi leader invaded Kuwait, and with war on the horizon, they found themselves at centre of international hostage crisis.One of those men was Bobby Buchanan from Armagh, who left his we and two young children at home to go to Iraq for what looked to be a lucrative job.In the hour-long documentary which airs on Monday night at .pm on BBC One NI Bobby said a lot of the decorators working on the Mivan project in Baghdad were familiar with each other: “We’d all worked together before. “We’re a mixture of Protestants and Catholics, all working class, I’d worked with them for years, all good lads.”Peter McNally from Portadown was excited about the job in Saddam’s palace. He said: “I’d loved going away to work, dferent jobs, dferent people, dferent towns.“When we started working for Deluxe decorators it was just all local work and then they got in with Mivan and we started doing jobs in England and Germany and into Europe and then into America. The money was better when you were going away.“We were approached to go to Iraq, I says ‘I’ll go to the moon’.”Michael Sands who was an engineer with construction and fit out company Mivan said: “I’d absolutely no concern at all coming from Northern Ireland. We’d all lived through the Troubles. I was  in  so I was well used to the Troubles and a militarised country. It didn’t have a bearing on my decision to go.”Bernard McKeever’s we Sharon was a bit more apprehensive: “From the very start I didn’t want him to go. I knew there was something going on to do with oil. He said I was reading too much into it.“It just happened to be the night that I recorded the news that was when it came out to say [Saddam] had signed a peace thing with Kuwait, they weren’t going to invade the country over oil. [Bernard] says, ‘you see, everything’s fine’.Bernard himself recalled: “I thought, ‘it’s going to be good money, it will set us up and hopefully everything will go from there’.”When they arrived in Iraq, where they were put up in a luxury hotel, the men observed that the people were enjoying being out on the streets after the end of the war with Iran.Bernard said: “Everywhere you went at every junction or every roundabout there was a mosaic of Saddam Hussein so he must have been a popular guy. In the later days we learnt from dferent people just how afraid they were of him.”Fellow decorator Michael O’Neill, one of the youngest of the crew, said: “He controlled the radio, he controlled the TV, as the man said to us, ‘the walls have ears’.”The team of labourers from NI were tasked with fitting out Saddam’s palace in Baghdad, a job which required bulletproof windows made in the Harland and Wolff shipyard as well as ornate marbles and granites.Peter admitted to using a common decorators’ trick of hiding their signature under layers of paint: “My name is all over the palace behind the walls, it’s probably still there.”When they weren’t working the men were able to let their hair down in the Mivan social club. Some footage of their social gatherings feature in the documentary made by Tern Television.Sharon said: “They were totally oblivious to what was going on. There was nothing on the news there. I was getting the BBC world news at home.”Back in Northern Ireland those tuning into the news learnt that Iraq had invaded Kuwait and warned foreign powers not to intervene.Bobby said: “The news we were getting, we thought it was more of a skirmish rather than a real invasion.”The local newspaper reported that Kuwait had asked for Iraqi military aid and Baghdad had responded positively. Michael commented: “[Saddam] invaded but he didn’t tell his people that. His own people were oblivious to that because they weren’t getting any outside news. You’d no internet in them days don’t forget.”He added: “On the high rise buildings there were anti-aircraft guns, there was a barracks beside the palace, you’d have seen the recruits training. It was not an army, it was just people conscripted, all shapes and sizes – big, small, fat, skinny, it was so hilarious. Some had boots, some had trainers, some had nothing on their feet. These people weren’t ready to fight a war.”Foreigners in Iraq were told they wouldn’t be able to travel until things were resolved. At the time it was reported , Britons were stranded in Iraq, virtual hostage to Saddam Hussein.Grenville Redmond, former director of Mivan, said: “Saddam would have referred to us as his special guests.” Painter Paul McCabe said: “It didn’t matter who you were, you weren’t allowed to go anywhere. We had to move out of the hotel and move into staff houses that were owned by Mivan and dferent countries. Nobody really knew for sure what was happening.”The decorators stopped being paid but when they refused to work they were told they wouldn’t be given VISAs to go home.It also became more dficult to get in contact with loved ones back home.“You just had to keep trying and trying,” said Bernard. “It maybe took a few days.”Sharon: “It went down from having a telephone call every second day to nothing. Looking back on it now it was terrible, having that dread every day, and maybe not even sleeping for a few days.”Bobby said: “Money was getting tight at home. I was playing for Armagh City at the time, they actually organised a charity thing and they used to send money home to my we. They used to give her £ a week which was fantastic. It was much appreciated.”With Allies sending troops to the Persian Gulf, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein warned of deadly consequences of western intervention.Michael explained how the men stayed up to date with what was happening: “We used to smuggle our radio into the palace and we’d listen to the home service. “It was what was coming fromthat we were worried about. The coalition coming in and invading Iraq, or bombing, or whatever, because we were near the complexes that would have been hit.” Paul said: “My main worry is they would start something before we got out. If the war started when we were still there we were going to be in danger.”A plan had been drawn upwar should break out they’d make for the border in cars.Peter commented: “Some fellas where more scared than others, the only time that it got a wee bit [scary] was whenever I seen the tracer shells lighting up the sky practising for the planes coming in.“I remember one night when the storm started, there were about four or five dferent thunderstorms, we woke up and thought they’d started bombing.”Sharon, who was back home in NI, said: “Every day you were waiting on a call saying they’d been taken , thinking they were never coming back.”In October  Saddam agreed to release all Irish citizens over . John McCausland, a carpenter from Co Antrim was one of them.Paul said: “When John got out that gave us a little bit of hope.”The documentary unearths some touching moments that made the news back home.Footage is shown of Peter receiving a th birthday card and Bobby getting a painting from his daughter Carrie after missing her first day at school.Though the most signicant footage is of PM Margaret Thatcher’s resignation in November .Some of those stranded in Iraq felt she’d been too hostile to Saddam and hadn’t helped their case.Shortly after John Major took charge Saddam announced the hostages could go home.Bobby recalled the moment he was reunited with his family at Aldergrove airport: “I was so glad to be back. “It did change my thinking on le. I was definitely more of a mellow person. Nothing annoyed me much. “The we would probably say I’m back to myself now.”Bernard said: “The innocents always suffer. It’s just something that links us all together for the rest of your le.“Iraq will always be in my heart.”Peter said: “It makes you appreciate what you’ve got.”  \"       \"  Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"health board may meet more frequently due coronavirus ","story":"Increasing concern for welfare of missing NI man Caoimhin Gallagher last seen one month ago - known to have connections in Londonderry and Portadown   MP dismisses critics of abstention on vote for free school mealsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsHealth board may meet more frequently due to coronavirusThe Board of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust may have to consider meeting more frequently to discuss the pressures being placed on the organisation by the coronavirus pandemic, its chair has confirmed.By Adam MortonThursday, nd October , : pmUpdated Thursday, nd October , : pm  \"       \"  Addressing a virtual meeting of the Trust’s Board, Roberta Brownleedescribed dealing with both the normal running of the Trust and the extra pressures as a result of the pandemic as a “challenge”.“COVID- has taken over our lives,” said Mrs Brownlee.“While we continue to do the day-to-day work a lot of time is being taken up with the pandemic but at the same time we are still trying to run our day to day business and that is a challenge.\"“We may have to consider how often we meet.
