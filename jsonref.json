That’s its highest close since the last week of February 2020, during the early stages of the market crash caused by the first wave of Covid-19.  Nearly every sector rose today, led by utilities, consumer non-cyclicals, real estate firms, energy and miners.  The weaker pound will have given multinationals a small lift, as it makes their overseas earnings more valuable in sterling terms. The Bank of England’s more upbeat forecasts clearly haven’t worried City investors today -- as Sandra Holdsworth, Head of Rates UK at Aegon Asset Management, explains: The number of people filing new jobless claims dropped to a fresh pandemic low last week, at 498,000. That’s the lowest since the first wave of Covid-19 hit the US economy in March 2020. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, says it shows the US labor market is improving -- and could herald a strong American jobs report on Friday. John Laing develops greenfield infrastructure projects - typically in Public Private Partnerships. That includes building courts, hospitals, high-speed trains, roads, bridges, and renewable energy systems such as biomass plants, onshore wind farms and solar PV. John Laing told the City that it was in talks with private equity firm KKR, although there’s no certainty of an offer. KKR has until 5pm on 3rd June to make a bid, or walk away.  Share in John Laing, which had been rising already today, promptly jumped sharply higher. They’re trading at 371p now in late trading (a level not seen since late May 2020). John Laing was founded in 1848 as a building company in Carlisle. It listed on the stock exchange in 1953, but was taken private in 2006, only to float again nine years later. As we wrote back in 2015: It was a volatile session - after a sudden jolt at noon, the pound then hit a one-week high against the dollar, before subsiding as traders digested the report. Neil Wilson of Markets says it was a ‘whipsaw’ move., adding: Although the Bank insists this is an ‘operational decision’, it does show some confidence in the economic recovery, Wilson adds - otherwise the Bank could have kept buying £4.4bn of bonds each week, and pledged to do more QE if needed.Q: Some people say that bubbles are forming in financial markets, with people ploughing money into all sorts of crazy things. What does cryptocurrencies say about the state of financial markets? Have you any concerns about the impact of ultraloose policies on markets? Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank watches the markets very carefully. There have been a number of developments in the last few months. On their own, they’re not a financial stability risk, but the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee will look very carefully at the overall picture as it draws up the next Financial Stability Report, Bailey explains.  And on crypto - he insists that they are assets, not currencies. Bailey repeats a point he’s made a few times in recent years -- only buy them if you’re prepared to lose all your money. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent predicts that sectors who saw the weakest growth in lockdown should see the strongest growth coming out. (He doesn’t specify which, but clearly it would include hospitality and leisure).This is a very unusual situation, the governor explains. There has been very big build up in unanticipated savings under the lockdown. But it isn’t evenly distributed - it’s concentrated among those whose incomes have been supported, and those who have had “much reduced” chances to spend. Governor Bailey says the Bank is ‘enormously grateful’ to Chris Whitty, the UK Chief Medical Officer, who has met with the MPC for an hour before each forecast round, to answer their questions on the pandemic. Whitty has cautioned us that yes, there is a risk of a new strain of Covid emerging, Bailey says, and that’s factored into the Bank’s forecasts. In terms of timing, Bailey wouldn’t put too much emphasis on the possibility of a summer surge, saying forecasts of a summer pickup have a very large confidence band (meaning there’s a lot of uncertainty about the projection).  There’s also an argument that Covid has a seasonal pattern, he continues (so any new strain might be more likely to come in the winter). So that’s one reason the Bank’s current forecasts have a relatively large short-term downside risk, Bailey concludes, because there is the possibility that the UK could get a variant, so the question would then be how much protection existing vaccines give.Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says that the furlough scheme effectively removes the supply of labour, as the pandemic removes demand.  Q: It looks like this recession will be much less severe with much less scarring than the one after the 2008 financial crisis. Why? Andrew Bailey says research shows that recessions linked to financial crises tend to be more severe and have a longer-lasting impact.  We have not had a financial crisis this time - the reforms introduced after the last crisis have stood the test, Bailey replies. There was a lot of debate last summer about the prospect of a V-shaped recovery -- and some criticism that the Bank was too optimistic, Bailey says. But today, the ‘basic mechanics’ of that shape of recovery remain reasonably strong, partly on the back of a “hugely successful vaccination programme”, Bailey adds -- although a year ago, the return of Covid (causing the current lockdown) wasn’t expected.Andrew Bailey says the UK hasn’t seen a bounceback quite of this nature in modern times.  The strong growth recorded in 1941 was heavily influenced by wartime conditions, he points out, explaining: We possibly saw some of those effects during the Industrial Revolution, Bailey continues (he did his PhD on this period). But the important point is that this is a bounceback from 2020, Bailey adds. Governor Bailey explains that there are a lot of uncertainties, beyond the pandemic itself. There are very big questions about the path of supply and demand, and the structure of the economy, depending how many of the changes in spending and working patterns remain, and which do not. So the Bank will watch it very carefully.Governor Andrew Bailey says it’s important to put today’s forecast of a faster recovery into proper context. Given the UK had such a large fall in output last year, it is good news that we’re getting a recovery this year, he explains. However, “let’s not get carried away”, he adds. It takes the UK back, by the end of this year, to the level of output at the end of 2019, pre-Covid.

With the global secondhand clothing market set to grow from $28bn (£20bn) to $64bn (£46bn) by 2024, wardrobes could be largely made up of secondhand items – rented or bought. Natalie-Anne Hasseck, co-founder of the fashion rental subscription service Onloan, credits the change in consumer behaviour to a move away from status to “pleasure” dressing. During lockdown, demand for knitwear rocketed, but so did the loaning of flamboyant pieces. “The bigger the collar, the better,” she says. “We had a Mother of Pearl pie-crust collar shirt that barely touched ground in our warehouse as it just kept being rented out on repeat. Our customers care less about trends and more about identity and personalisation.” Better communication from brands is needed, as is a more unified industry approach to what constitutes a “sustainable” brand. “In our marketing materials, we promote to our customers how to live more sustainably,” says Lucy Macnamara, founder of ethical womenswear brand Aspiga. “We hosted a series of Instagram Lives with celebrities and influencers about changes we can make in our daily lives to live more eco-friendly.” Fast fashion brands are now facing a new challenge: being less wasteful is on trend. Couttigane says she has seen an increase in the willingness to shop secondhand, largely because platforms such as Depop – a community-led marketplace, renowned for good-quality secondhand and original vintage clothes – make the experience accessible, inclusive and desirable. “We want to use our reach to influence the way we consume fashion, encouraging people to consider secondhand first,” says Justine Porterie, Depop’s head of sustainability. An important factor in extending the life of clothes is how we care for them. The ecological cleaning brand Ecover has relaunched its laundry detergents made with biodegradable and plant-based ingredients. “Every 30 seconds, 1,000 items of clothing are thrown away in the UK,” says Ecover’s senior brand manager Charlotte Snelgrove. “We want to challenge the nation to wash right, wear more and waste less.” Find out more at ecoverdepop"},{"url":null,"title":"you dont know what story an item tells why im buying and selling secondhand clothes","story":"Bennett is the founder of online vintage shop Soul and Flare, which joined Depop – a community-led marketplace, renowned for good-quality secondhand and original vintage clothes – in 2016. Standing out and making sure her offering was of the highest quality was even more important for Bennett once she had started her Depop shop. And one of the biggest aims and values of her company is to eliminate fashion waste by encouraging others to shop vintage and look after the clothes they already own. She doesn’t see her job as “just” buying and selling vintage, though. For Bennett, the process is a full circle of discovery and care – from the items she chooses, to the way she washes and mends them. Before any repairs begin, the clothes need to be washed and cleaned delicately. “I’m an avid repair seamstress, but the process is about not over-washing clothes, as well,” she explains. The wrong detergent with too many harsh chemicals can spell the end for delicate vintage fabrics. Bennett believes that treating vintage clothes correctly is the only way to preserve them for future owners. Some of the vintage clothes that Bennett sells have been worn on and off for up to 70 years – something of a miracle and testament to their quality as well as how they’re looked after, she says. The last thing you’d want to do is just throw them in the washing machine with any old detergent. That’s why she has a clear system – first up is checking the label and material to see if it’s washable, and whether it should be hand washed. Then it’s about using the right cleaning products. Bennett is committed to using products that are eco-friendly – she’s stopped using bleach at home completely, and only uses Ecover detergent, made with plant-based, biodegradable ingredients as it’s gentle on the vintage fabrics as well as kinder to the environment. Bennett is based in Nottingham, where her love of vintage began with visits to car boot sales and charity shops with her mum, before she worked in a vintage shop. Nowadays, wearing secondhand or pre-loved can be quite a badge of honour, but in decades past it was often seen as something to hide. For some, buying vintage from a company such as Soul and Flare is a new experience, but Bennett has been learning her trade for a long time, meaning she really knows what she’s talking about. “I’ve been running Soul and Flare for around five years solidly but have been in the vintage trade for more than a decade. I fell into it in many ways but, growing up, my mum would drag us around charity shops and car boot sales. In her own way, she was sustainable even if she didn’t know what the word meant then. When I left college, I was making items for friends and family, and eventually got a job at a vintage clothing shop as their rework seamstress, and that’s where it stemmed from. That’s when I started witnessing the vast amounts of clothing that we waste in the UK, and my passion for reviving, repairing and making clothing last began. It’s not just something I do as a job, I do it at home, too – it’s my lifestyle. I look after my possessions – whether that’s furniture or clothing – and everything I wear is secondhand, so it’s deep-rooted in me. Ecover has teamed up with Depop, the marketplace app where you can buy and sell unique fashion, to challenge the nation to extend the life of their clothing and help fight fashion waste.

How we clean also has an impact. The process of doing laundry can impact the environment from the moment you turn the machine on. Higher temperatures create a higher carbon footprint, while the wrong wash setting can damage clothes, meaning you need to discard or replace them sooner. And the more clothes we buy, the more we wash. Throwaway culture is turning our planet into a giant fabric landfill. According to charity Wrap, 1,000 items of clothing are thrown away every 30 seconds in the UK. Leslie Reichert, from Massachusetts, who made herself a name as a green cleaning coach, says that altering the way you wash your clothes might not seem a big eco move, but for some it could be the perfect place to start. “Changes in the way you do your laundry are easy to implement and make a difference. By using an eco-friendly laundry soap, you can reduce the impact on the environment from the wash and you don’t need fabric softener.” Charlotte Snelgrove, senior brand manager at Ecover UK, says: “We’re never resting on our laurels, as a business we realise we can always improve on our products and push ourselves to go further in reducing our impact and finding new innovative ways to do this. We see our role in the cleaning category as highlighting environmental issues and trying to lead change by pioneering eco innovation and showing what is possible and hope bigger brands follow.” The world has taken notice, and eco influencers are getting on board. Georgina Wilson-Powell, founder and editor of the sustainable living magazine Pebble, says the brand has been leading the way for many years. “I’ve always been impressed with Ecover’s investment in innovation, both in packaging and detergents, as both can have such a negative impact on our environment. As more and more consumers look for brands that match their growing environmental credentials, it’s great to see Ecover build on its years of experience in this area,” she says. With the launch of its laundry detergent range, Ecover has gone back to basics, looking at its core value of cleaning, and how it impacts the environment. As well as continuing to use biodegradable, plant-based ingredients, Ecover’s fabric softeners contain a palm oil-free softening active derived from rapeseed oil and are vegan-friendly. The new Ecover bio detergent includes powerful enzymes that help your clothes last longer by fighting stains and removing bobbling from cotton fibres after multiple washes. There are active steps consumers can take, too – for instance, shorter wash cycles have been proved to help clothes last longer and shed fewer fibres. It’s a lot to think about when you’re just washing your clothes, but it’s something the world is waking up to, says Reichert. “Years ago, I was considered an ‘outlier’ due to my ideas about green cleaning – today, most manufacturers have eco-friendly options for consumers. Even the huge corporations have seen that there is a demand for green products. It’s not a movement, it’s a tsunami.” Ecover is on a mission to liberate the value of our clothing by challenging the nation to wash wisely, wear longer and waste less.

Judge Tim Smith ruled that the Home Office’s insistence that Mahabir’s family had to pay nearly £23,000 in fees to join her in the UK left her with “a thankless choice”. The judge said: Speaking via video link to the 12th Petersberg Climate Dialogue, an event convened by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Johnson said he hoped countries would hammer out the final details of “an era-defining outcome for our planet and future generations”. The PA Media news agency quoted the prime minister as saying:  The stakes are too high for Cop26 to become some sort of last-minute dash to the line. Johnson said countries should spend the next six months leading up to the talks “untangling the knots and unblocking some of the stickiest issues”.  Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, voted at his local polling place at Pollokshields Burgh Hall in Glasgow on Thursday morning. He is standing against Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, in the Glasgow Southside constituency, which includes Pollokshields. Nicola Sturgeon had already voted by post but she joined SNP candidate Roza Salih at Annette Street primary school polling place in Govanhill, Glasgow, to lend her support and meet a Syrian family as they cast their ballots. This year’s poll is the first in which people with refugee status are entitled to vote.  The Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie cast his ballot at Notre Dame primary school in Glasgow’s west end. Arriving on his bike, Harvie posed for press photographers before entering the polling place, wearing a face mask bearing the LGBT rainbow flag. After voting, and at the behest of the photographers, Harvie rode a bike pulling a small billboard adorned with his face.  The Alba party leader, Alex Salmond, cast his ballot in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. He told reporters he had put forward a “positive case” for “urgency” on Scottish independence. Questioned about his feelings on returning to his local polling station with the Alba party on the ballot paper, Salmond said it was a “different experience, but a familiar one”, adding: “Polling day is always an exciting day.”  The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, has already voted by post. British naval patrol vessels arrived in the waters around Jersey on Thursday as scores of French boats gathered at the port in St Helier to protest against post-Brexit fishing rights.  It followed French threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, a self-governing dependency of the UK off the tip of northern France. French fishers are protesting over new licences issued on Friday that restrict for the first time the number of days they can operate in shared waters. Unionist campaigners have spent tens of thousands of pounds urging pro-UK voters to act tactically. Two of Labour’s three constituency seats, East Lothian and Dumbarton, are at significant risk of falling to the SNP several Tory seats in the north-east are also highly vulnerable. That implies the Scottish Tory strategy of amplifying the prospects of an SNP majority and a second independence referendum has worked the Tories have urged unionist voters to lend their regional list votes to the party to thwart the SNP’s ambitions. These data suggest pro-UK voters are reacting to the SNP’s substantial 25-point lead in the opinion polls. Coupled with an increase in a backing for the Scottish Greens on the regional lists, there is widespread agreement pro-independence parties are likely to win a majority today.

Patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care – stood at 16,867 on Thursday, down from 17,520 a day earlier, Reuters reports. The van is thought to be the first of its kind in the UK and delivered its first vaccination service today to 32 worshippers at a mosque in Chelmsford. Men boarded the van to receive their jabs while women were vaccinated in the adjacent Marconi Centre, where the mosque is located.The Thurrock clinical commissioning group said they would work closely with community leaders to take a culturally sensitive approach towards reaching communities who might otherwise not take part in the national vaccination programme. The van will usually be located in the grounds of churches and mosques, and will vaccinate some people inside and others in a pop-up outdoor clinic.People can track the progress of the van on Twitter through the hashtag #EssexVaxVan, although they will not be able to turn up and receive a vaccination, since these will be prearranged with community leaders and targeted at those with highest need. The statement read: “We will not be able to truly recover until everyone, everywhere, has equal access to the vaccine. “And with that intention, we are inviting you to contribute whatever you can – if you have the means to do so – to bring vaccines to families in the world’s most vulnerable places. “For a donation of just $5 (£3.60), you can cover the cost of a dose for someone in need. “And because we were able to secure matching support from a number of organisations, that $5 you give will automatically turn into $20 (£14.40) – covering the cost of four doses.” The Sussexes went on to say: “We cannot think of a more resonant way to honour our son’s birthday. If we all show up, with compassion for those we both know and don’t know, we can have a profound impact. Even a small contribution can have a ripple effect. “Together, we can uplift, protect and care for one another.”Thirteen people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday, bringing the total coronavirus deaths to 127,583. Speaking on a visit Thursday to a vaccine centre, the president, Emmanuel Macron, said he “completely” supported opening up intellectual property protections for coronavirus vaccines. Macron said that “evidently, we must turn this vaccine in a global public good.” But he also argued that even if patents are waived, pharmaceutical companies in regions like Africa are not equipped to make coronavirus vaccines. Instead, donations of doses should be prioritised.

Photograph: Tom HonanCars will be permanently banned from several areas around Grafton Street in Dublin from May 24th, ahead of the resumption of outdoor dining in June.However, while South William Street, Drury Street, South Anne Street and Dame Court would all have car free areas, their full pedestrianisation has been curtailed because some car park owners, including Brown Thomas said they could not facilitate the measures.Parts of these four streets, as well as Duke Street, were pedestrianised on a trial basis over weekends last July and August, with parking spaces turned into outdoor seating areas for cafes and restaurants to accommodate more people during the Covid-19 restrictions.Dublin City Council held a public consultation process on the plans last November and 97 per cent of respondents were in favour of their implementation.The council had initially hoped to have the measures in place ahead of the easing of Level 5 restrictions last December, but this was delayed until January. The plans were put on hold again when restrictions were reintroduced. Work has now begun with a view to completion in just over three weeks time. Fully pedestrianisedUnder the council’s plans, South Anne Street will be fully pedestrianised, as it was during the trial. Dame Court, the street that runs from Exchequer Street down to the Stag’s Head pub, would also be fully pedestrianised. Drury Street will be pedestrianised just after its junction with Fade Street to the Drury Street underground carpark.The South William Street pedestrian zone will be substantially smaller than during the trials. It had been pedestrianised between the Brown Thomas carpark exit and Chatham Row, but this required reversing the direction of vehicles leaving the car park, with a stopgo system in place at Exchequer Street.The council said it asked the car-park owners if it would be possible to reverse their entry and exit arrangements to make South William Street an entry point to the car park with exit from Clarendon Street. “This would then allow for the majority of the street to be pedestrianised,” the council said.The car-park owners said doing so would pose “insurmountable structural difficulties that cannot be overcome”. In addition they said the trials caused considerable congestion internally to the car park and its business dropped by 30 per cent from the first week of the trial.As a result, only the small area between the car-park exit and Exchequer Street, a 30 metre stretch, will be pedestrianised from 11am. However, the only vehicles using the street will be those exiting from the Brown Thomas car park.Only one business used the outdoor furniture on Duke Street during the trial. There is also a private car park, a delivery yard and construction site that require access, the council said, and it decided not to go ahead with the street’s permanent pedestrianisation.Merrion RowMeanwhile the council is to implement a trial of traffic restrictions on Merrion Row, following an overwhelmingly positive response to outdoor dining proposals for the street.The council last month held a consultation process on plans to reduce traffic on Dublin’s Merrion Row to one lane to facilitate summer outdoor dining. It received more than 2,400 submissions, 93 per cent of which were in favour of the plans. On May 15th and 16th, the three traffic lanes on the road will be reduced to one. This will involve the redirection of traffic onto Hume Street and Ely Place from St Stephen’s Green to avoid bottlenecks on Merrion Row.Dublin City Council said it had been approached by businesses on Merrion Row seeking the full pedestrianisation of the street to facilitate outdoor dining. However, it said the National Transport Authority had advised that the removal of buses from the street was “not feasible from an operational point of view”.Instead the council is proposing to keep traffic on the one-way street, but restrict them to one lane, with space on both sides of the road to be made available for outdoor furniture, if the trial is successful.The council said it is working on plans to increase pedestrian and dining space in other parts of the city. Temple Bar businesses are preparing to submit a proposal to the council which would facilitate up to 3,000 diners on the streets in the cultural quarter."},{"url":null,"title":"almost third of adults have received covid 19 vaccine says hse","story":"HSE chief executive Paul Reid at Dr Steevens’ Hospital for the weekly HSE operational update on the response to Covid-19. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandAlmost a third of all adults in the State have received a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest HSE figures.As of Wednesday evening, 1.7 million vaccine doses had been administered. Of these 1.23 million people received a first jab (32.56 per cent of the population over the age of 16), according to the HSE.Of those 466,000 (12.3 per cent) or one-in-eight of the adult population have been fully vaccinated with 42,000 vaccines administered on Wednesday.Speaking at the weekly HSE briefing, chief executive Paul Reid said the country had “not been at such a hopeful moment since January 2020” and the vaccination programme has “brought us to a very good place”.All the indicators of sickness and death related to Covid-19 are down, he said. Hospital admissions with Covid-19 on Thursday morning were at 131, down 19 per cent on last week.There were 19 deaths from Covid-19 in April in over-65s in comparison with 1,677 in the first four weeks of 2021.There were no Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes last week. Among healthcare staff there have been fewer than 40 cases a week on average over the last month. At the height of the pandemic there were more than 1,200 cases a week recorded in healthcare staff.Currently 97 per cent of people over the age of 85 have received a vaccine and 90 per cent have been fully vaccinated.Almost everybody in the 75-84 age cohort have receive a vaccine and 85 per cent have received a second dose. In those between 65 and 74, 84 per cent have received one dose and 9 per cent have received a second.Mr Reid said he anticipated that the HSE would carry out between 220,000 and 240,000 vaccines this week.Next week, the HSE hopes to carry out between 250,000 and 270,000 vaccines. This will be mostly made up of second doses for the over-70s while commencing vaccinating the 50 -59 age group.To date 104,000 people in that age cohort have registered for their vaccination through the online HSE portal which opened on Tuesday.The 14-day incidence rate for Covid-19 in Ireland of 115 per 100,000 is now the fourth lowest in the EU.HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said there was “huge enthusiasm” in the population for the Covid-19 vaccines.Dr Henry said it was becoming “clearer and clearer” that not only do vaccines prevent people getting sick but they also help prevent transmission. To date in Israel the vaccination programme has reduced the number of cases by 90 per cent and by 86 per cent in the vaccinated population among NHS staff in the UK.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

File photograph: Thomas KienzleAFP via Getty ImagesThe Government could be on a collision course with the State’s powerful pharmaceutical industry over support for US backing of a move to lift patent protection on Covid-19 vaccines.The Biden administration has thrown its support behind the move that would allow other companies to make the jabs but reduce the profits of the pharmaceutical giants behind the vaccines.US trade representative Katherine Tai said that it would support the waiver of intellectual property protections on vaccines “to help end the pandemic” and that the US would participate in negotiations on the move at the World Trade Organisation, which sets the rules for global trade.“Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,” said Ms Tai.The slow pace of the rollout of the vaccines and shortages in the global supply have put pressure on governments to look to new measures as some countries face new surges in infections.Intellectual property is the valuable creative asset behind the development of innovative medicines. Patents protect the creators of those assets by giving them the benefit of a short-term monopoly on the sale of the vaccines to cover the cost of the development and to encourage further investment.Supporters of the patent waiver argue that it would allow the manufacturing of vaccines to be increased dramatically and provide more affordable supplies to less wealthy countries.PoliticalMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney described the announcement by the US trade representative and the Biden administration as “very significant”.“It won’t solve all Covid vaccine manufacturing and supply issues, but it is a step and the right decision in response to a global demand emergency,” he tweeted.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly retweeted Ms Tai’s tweet about the US move, describing it as a “hugely positive development.”Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said the decision of the US administration to support a waiver “is very significant and should cause the EU and other developed countries to reassess their position”.Urging caution however, he said in the Dáil that “our strong view is that Covax is the best way to do this, the international partnership”.Mr Varadkar said “very few countries in the global south have the infrastructural know-how or the materials to make those vaccines and there’s no point in giving somebody a recipe if they don’t have the kitchen or the cooking skills or the ingredients.”The Trips (trade-related intellectual property rights) waiver “is definitely an option”, he told Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore and People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy.But “what we want to do is take actions that do good, not just actions that look good or make us feel good. And we think the best way to do that is to involve the pharmaceutical companies, the scientists and universities in the solution, a solution that will actually allow more vaccines to be made particularly in the global south.”World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the Biden administration’s backing as “a monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19.”He said it was a “powerful example” of the US leadership to address global health challenges.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said that the bloc is “ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner.”French president Emmanuel Macron said that he was “absolutely in favour” of the plan.India and South Africa are leading a group of countries that have, for several months, been pushing for patents on vaccines to be set aside in a move they argue would increase vaccine production around the world. More than 100 countries support the proposal.Pharma oppositionCritics of the waiver argue that sharing details around the creative process behind the vaccines would result in large pharmaceutical companies giving up valuable trade secrets and serve as a disincentive for companies to develop medicines and vaccines in response to other health crises.The share prices of vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer and Moderna, fell in response to the US government’s support for the patent waiver.The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, a representative body for the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland, said that a waiver on the vaccines would not boost production capacity for the jabs but would instead set back “the medicines innovation agenda.”“It is a short-sighted and ineffectual decision that puts at risk the hard-won progress in fighting Covid-19,” said Oliver O’Connor, the chief executive of the IPHA.“We are urging the Government to oppose the waiver and to continue to back intellectual property as the formula for the invention of new vaccines, medicines and technologies.”Mr O’Connor said that a waiver would risk “erting raw materials and supplies away from well-established, effective supply chains to less efficient manufacturing sites where productivity and quality may be an issue” and “risks the entry of counterfeit vaccines” into global supplies.The industry has argued that it is pushing for an increase in vaccine production instead through licensing partnerships between vaccine creators and manufacturers.“Intellectual property is an important strategic area for the industry because it allows the industry to invest in research and commercialise products,” said Matt Moran, chief executive of BiopharmaChem, part of the business representative and lobby group, Ibec.“It underpins the research that led to the discovery of the vaccines that are being used and allowed companies to form partnerships on the basis that IP was going to be respected.”Mr Moran said that “any move to weaken” intellectual property would be a concern to the industry as it could disrupt supply chains and lead to low-quality products being made.The pharmaceutical industry is a key sector for the Government, employing about 25,000 people directly and about the same number who provide services to the industry.In 2019, the industry accounted for €140 billion in annual exports, or 32 per cent of the Irish gross domestic product, the value of goods and services produced in the State."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government asks ag about legality of ban on housing estate bulk buys","story":"New homes at Mullen Park, Maynooth, Co Kildare. Round Hill, a multinational investment company, is in discussions to buy 115 homes at the development. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Attorney-General is being consulted by Government to ascertain if its proposal to prevent so-called cuckoo funds from buying up entire housing development in the suburbs will amount to a breach of Constitutional rights on property. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe are working on options to address the practise where large international investment funds have moved into the residential housing market.In the past week, it has been disclosed that one global property firm, Round Hill Capital, has acquired in a joint venture hundreds of homes in two new housing developments that would normally be targeted at first time buyers, and intends to put them on the private rental market at prices close to €2,000 per month. The company has bought close to 150 homes in the Mullen Park in Maynooth and 112 houses in Bay Meadows in Hollystown, Dublin 15. The company intends to rent out the houses as single family homes. Amid an escalating political crisis for the Government on this matter, Mr O’Brien and Mr Donohoe are expected to present a number of options to Government next week, which might provide solution. Mr O’Brien is said to be considering reintroducing a Bill he published while in Opposition in 2019, which was designed to prevent investment funds acquiring entire developments. It stipulated that 30 per cent of all units be reserved for first-time buyers. If the Bill were reintroduced in tandem with proposed changes to Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, (which provide for 10 per cent social housing and a further 10 per cent affordable housing on all new developments), it would mean that 50 per cent of all new housing developments would be reserved for social, affordable and first-purchase, houses. Labour’s spokeswoman on Housing Rebecca Moynihan said she would reintroduce Mr O’Brien’s 2019 Bill word-for-word if he failed to do so. The second option being examined is to ban such practices outside of city centre cores or areas of high density development. The Government is of the view that block buying apartments for private rental can have a role, especially for highly-paid employees of social media and technology companies. They tend to be younger, single and are not interested in purchasing property because of mobile lifestyles. Mr Donohoe is also looking at the tax laws to see if changes can be made to discourage such practices. However, a Government source said on Thursday that all of the options might impinge on constitutional rights in relation to property and the advice of A-G Paul Gallagher was being sought to ensure they did not breach such rights. The source also tempered expectation of an immediate solution saying it would take several weeks to arrive at a final decision. Speaking at the Oireachtas finance committee on Thursday , Mr Donohoe said he was looking at the tax structure in place in relation to investment funds acquiring bundles of homes in Ireland. “I am currently looking at this particular issue of whether there is anything in our tax code that is incentivising the purchase of homes that are already built.”He said that he “will not give any indication” in relation to what tax changes may occur. “But myself and Minister O’Brien are looking at this matter”. Still, he said that funds “do have a role to play” in the housing market, especially in pre-funding the development of rental properties. He said that institutional investors own about 15,000 apartments in Ireland, which is a “small share” of the total market. He said that a “balance” needs to be struck as he examines the tax structure and he wants to make sure that any potential change “doesn’t undermine the delivery of new homes and new apartments being built”. Outright Ban On Thursday Mr O’Brien said all measures would be considered to stop investment funds buying up full housing estates “up to and including” an outright ban.Mr O’Brien said he was committed to having proposals ready by next week with regard to legislating for investment funds.Speaking on Newstalk’ Pat Kenny show, Mr O’Brien said that the tax treatment of such investment funds was where the issue would be resolved in the long term.The Minister said he was considering all options, but that ultimately the Department of Finance would have to bring forward proposals to deal with the tax element.It was not acceptable to have investment funds come into the country to buy up family homes “from under the nose” of families, he added.Earlier Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan repeated the Government’s determination to stop the practice of investment funds bulk-buying new homes, and said the issue would be tackled through the planning process.Mr Ryan said Mr O’Brien was going to address the issue through the planning process, but different approaches would also be required as it was a complex issue. “I believe the best approach is planning,” he added.Mr Ryan said the Government is committed to not allowing the housing market be dominated by investment funds who were freezing couples out of the market, but added that investors were needed for projects such as large apartment buildings and the State needed to operate cost rental schemes. Mr Ryan said he did not believe the practice of bulk-buying houses in new estates was widespread, but the Government had to stop it before it became widespread. The housing market is not functioning as it is and other measures would be needed, he said.Mr Ryan said the move could require legislation which would take time. This is echoed by some sources involved in the discussions, who fear the process could be fraught with legal difficulties.Swoop in Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris has said it was “never, ever” intended that investment funds could “swoop in” to bulk buy homes and keep them from first time buyers.The Government was going to move “very swiftly” to ensure that what had happened in the housing estate in Maynooth could not happen again, there was “absolute clarity” across Government on the issue.Private investment funds did have a role to play in helping housing supply, but situations like Maynooth would not be tolerated he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show. There would always be a role for private investors, to say otherwise was not the truth, he said.Actions would be taken to tighten the tax loopholess, he said. The Government wanted to level the playing field for first time buyers. The issue could not be personalised and proposals were from all of Government “not just Darragh O’Brien, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord government in a flap about the cuckoo in the property nest","story":"“How are ordinary house buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?” File photograph: iStock The Taoiseach was right to look concerned.A new strain has emerged.“There is something new in what happened over the weekend. There is no point in saying there isn’t because there is,” he informed Cian O’Callaghan of the Social Democrats.A new strain of the old greed.This could be called the “Maynooth variant” although a number of TDs say it isn’t new but an infection which has been slowly but steadily taking root under the eye of recent governments in a dangerously weakening market.“Insidious” is what Labour’s Duncan Smith called it.Micheál Martin identified this new strain during Leaders’ Questions.

Swooping in and scooping up.“Unacceptable,” he said. “Not acceptable.”Investment companies should not be purchasing entire suburban estates. His Government is absolutely opposed to this.The Taoiseach’s sincerity was genuine. As was his obvious concern, not just for the inidual victims of the Maynooth variant and other financial mutations, but for his administration’s future and his own political skin.He will be aware of the disgusted reaction to the Business Post’s weekend revelation of an investment vehicle called Round Hill Capital sneakily nipping in and snaffling all but 22 out of 174 new homes in a Kildare housing estate, shouldering shocked inidual buyers aside with its massive buying power.So he will be aware that this sort of practice has to be stopped, not only to help first-time buyers find a home but also to stem the public anger over the unfair, inequitable and dysfunctional state of the housing market here.Raging contagionAt least an effective vaccine exists now for coronavirus, while opposition criticism of the Coalition’s handling of the pandemic has always been tinged with the cautious awareness that a raging contagion is oblivious to the rule of politics.If only the same could be said for the housing crisis, which was very much with us before the pandemic and looks well set to outlast it. The climate allowing global real estate investment trusts (Reits) to flourish was engineered nearly 10 years ago by Fine Gael minister for finance Michael Noonan when he introduced tax breaks to encourage these companies to invest here and boost an economy emerging from deep recession.And in they poured.They weren’t supposed to go mad looking for money by milking the lovely tax breaks until too many suffered and too many noticed. They should have confined themselves to reaping lucrative returns from commercial property and nondescript apartment blocks full of students, young buckos and renters who can’t afford to buy their own place.They weren’t supposed to start muscling in on proper suburban houses built for people who want to raise a family and set down strong roots in the electoral register.But Darragh is all set to move on the Reits. Rarin’ to go. He just needs to take a good run at it first.Further analysisHe told Morning Ireland on Tuesday that further analysis would have to be done before he acts. Outright banning of these companies (was anyone suggesting that?) “would be a pretty radical move and might have unintended consequences”.It was pointed out more than once to his boss in the Dáil on Wednesday that Germany managed to do it, banning such wholesale investment in specific areas of housing as opposed to the entire property market.Cian O’Callaghan reminded the Taoiseach that the Construction Industry Federation said in 2009 that 95 per cent of new apartment builds in 2009 were bought by these funds. Was the Government only interested in protecting houses in the suburbs? What about apartments?This is when Micheál broke the news of the new variant – the purchasing of entire estates. New to him, that is.Social Democrat co-leader Catherine Murphy told him of other estates in Kildare which have been similarly bought over by these financial cuckoos who arrive with their fat chequebooks and special tax breaks and elbow out ordinary buyers from their chosen nest.“How are ordinary buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?”The Government has to do something. People who hoped to buy one of the new houses had no chance. The local council couldn’t match the swooping vultures either and the local housing trusts, also interested in acquiring some of the homes, were bankrolled out of buying by the cuckoos.“There’s a skewed ideology at play here,” she said, promising that “every one of us” would sit overnight or for the weekend if they had to pass legislation.The Taoiseach was very sympathetic. “In respect of that swoop-in by that investor, we are going to deal with that. That is not acceptable.”Factory shipsBut it gets worse. These Reits are like international factory ships, steaming into Ireland and indiscriminately hoovering up all sorts of housing stock.Duncan Smith revealed that first-time buyers are not just losing out on new homes. The investment funds are leaving young couples “absolutely devastated” by sniffing out second-hand homes that might be within the reach of first-time buyers and offering over the odds before they even hit the market.Sinn Féin, particularly its housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin, has been calling for a number of years for the tax loopholes which give these global financial machines a huge advantage over local buyers to be closed. Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also long complained about the actions of the funds and brought the personal stories of powerless people’s lives turned upside down by them.Mary Lou McDonald was the first at Leaders’ Questions to demand action, and quickly, from the Government. She was followed by a succession of speakers from all Opposition parties.Even the venerable Bernard Durkan, Fine Gael stalwart, wanted to know what emergency legislation is planned. As a Kildare TD he is well aware of the housing heartbreak in the constituency.Outside the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar limply said the situation is “undesirable”.Meanwhile, Darragh (let’s not be too radical) O’Brien said what is needed is “a whole-of-government approach”.The Taoiseach indicated that O’Brien, along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure, was working on a plan. But despite fevered demands from the Opposition to hear more, details there came none.In a novel twist, Labour Senator Rebecca Moynihan promised the party will introduce Darragh O’Brien’s 2019 Bill “word for word” if he doesn’t do it himself before the end of the week.Time for the Government to swoop and put this bad cuckoo back in its clock.Otherwise it will be the voters who are calling time."},{"url":null,"title":"how to improve weather predictions by reducing precision","story":"Atmospheric flow is chaotic: a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast.Weather forecasting relies on supercomputers used to solve the mathematical equations that describe atmospheric flow. The accuracy of the forecasts is constrained by available computing power.Processor speeds have not increased much in recent years and speed-ups are achieved by running many processes in parallel. Energy costs have risen rapidly: there is a multimillion-euro annual power bill to run a supercomputer, which may consume something like 10 megawatts of power.Early computer programs for weather prediction, written in the Fortran language, stored numbers in single precision. Each number had 32 binary digits or bits corresponding to a decimal number with about seven significant digits. Later models moved to double precision, each number having 64 bits and about 15 accurate decimal digits. This is now common practice.It seems self-evident that higher numerical precision would result in greater forecast accuracy, but this is not necessarily the case. Observations, which provide starting data, have only a few digits precision. We may know the temperature to one-tenth of a degree or the wind speed within one metre per second. Representing these values with several digits beyond the decimal point may be futile. It could be likened to giving somebody’s height to the nearest millimetre or, in double precision, the nearest micron, which is meaningless.Computational resourcesOf course, higher precision does reduce errors during the millions of computations needed for a forecast. But higher precision also implies greater storage requirements, larger data transmission volumes and longer processing times. Are these costs justified or can limited computational resources be used in more efficient ways?At the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, researchers have been seeking ways to reduce computing power. They have found that 64-bit accuracy is not necessary and that, with 32-bit numbers, forecasts of the same quality are obtained much faster. The 40 per cent saving can be used in other ways, like enhancing spatial resolution or increasing ensemble size. Thus, a reduction in numerical precision can result in improved forecast accuracy.Chaotic flowAtmospheric flow is chaotic: this means that a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast. Chaos was well-described by meteorologist Ed Lorenz, who asked if a tiny disturbance could cause a storm in a far-away continent. The idea is encapsulated in a Limerick:Lorenz demonstrated, with skill,The chaos of heatwave and chill:Tornadoes in TexasAre formed by the flexesOf butterflies’ wings in BrazilTo allow for chaos, meteorologists run their models multiple times with slightly different starting values. The spread of these “ensembles” gives a measure of the confidence that can be placed in a forecast, and probabilities of different scenarios can be given. Researchers at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were surprised that reducing numerical precision of the computations had little influence on the quality of the ensemble forecasts.For climate simulations, which run over decades or centuries, it is expected that, by using reduced number lengths, substantial savings will be possible. Some sensitive operations like matrix inversion may require double precision but the bulk of the calculations can be done with 32 bits. Current work is also testing half-precision (16-bit numbers) for non-sensitive components of the models.Peter Lynch is emeritus professor at UCD school of mathematics and statistics, University College Dublin.

Photograph:  John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesOn Christmas Eve last year, as the Brexit negotiations were entering their final minutes, Michel Barnier sought out his British counterpart in a room in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.“After nine months of negotiations, it is the last time I would see David Frost and our final exchange is professional and cold,” Barnier, who was chief Brexit negotiator, writes in The Great Illusion: a secret Brexit diary (2016-2020)“He knows I know that until the last moment he has been trying to circumvent me by opening a parallel negotiating track with Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. And he knows it has not been successful.”Although he describes Frost as courteous, Barnier makes clear that he neither trusted the British negotiator nor admired his negotiating style. A few weeks earlier, when the British team were refusing to engage with issues of concern to the European side, Barnier told them their negotiating technique was a farce.Throughout his 500-page diary, which is published in French on Thursday and will appear in an English translation in October, Barnier is bewildered by the British approach to the talks. He never wavers from his conviction that Britain made a mistake in leaving the European Union but he is surprised again and again by the incompetence and self-delusion that informed London’s negotiating strategy.When Theresa May declared in Lancaster House that Britain wanted to leave the single market and the customs union but hoped to maintain many of their benefits, he could scarcely believe what he was hearing.“Have the consequences of these decisions been thought through, measured, discussed? Does she realise this rules out almost all forms of cooperation we have with our partners?” he writes.“I am amazed at the way the prime minister has shown her hand.”He is generous towards May, describing her as a courageous woman surrounded by a lot of men putting their personal interests ahead of those of their country. Boris Johnson was one of those men but Barnier is careful not to underestimate him and finds him to be an appealing, if “baroque”, personality.He enjoyed a warm relationship with David Davis but has little complimentary to say about the next Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whom he describes as having a messianic glint in his eye.When Raab demanded that the Irish Border issue should be resolved as part of an overall agreement, he warned that the EU would otherwise be responsible for the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North.‘The fault of the UK’“We are searching for solutions together. And Dominic, if this threat is the new line of your government, then the negotiations can end immediately. And I will prepare myself in the coming days to inform the European Parliament and member states. We will regard the failure as being the fault of the UK,” Barnier told him.From the start, the issue of the Border was central to the talks and Barnier is at his most passionate when he describes his personal commitment to the peace process and his feelings when he met people in Northern Ireland.“I promised myself in this negotiation not to fuel the polemics and attacks from the British tabloids, to pay attention to the words I use, to stick to the facts, the figures, the legal fundamentals, in short, to leave little room for emotion and feelings, for the sake of objectivity. But here in Ireland . . . it is difficult not tobe touched by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express themselves, the memories that remind me of this tragedy,” he writes.Barnier describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, praising his role in the abortion rights referendum. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed” and Barnier singles out John Callinan from the Taoiseach’s office and Ireland’s former EU ambassador Declan Kelleher for praise.While May was hamstrung by the need to negotiate every step in the Brexit talks with her own party, Barnier maintained unity among the EU’s member-states by frequent visits to capitals and open channels of communication to the leaders.Johnson’s indifference to the truth and his pursuit of “dead cat” strategies and staged crises complicated the negotiations and when Frost opened the second phase of negotiations he told Barnier that the prime minister did not feel bound by the political declaration he agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement.The Internal Market Act, which included clauses that would have allowed the British government to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, was the trigger for Barnier’s final loss of trust in his negotiating partners. He suggests that Johnson waited until Donald Trump’s election defeat before withdrawing the offending clauses, fearful of their impact on his relationship with Joe Biden.La Grande Illusion – Journal secret du Brexit (2016-2020) is published by Gallimard.

People who earlier in the year were studiously following the rules are now breaking them in all kinds of little ways. The public has decided that the Covid emergency is over – at least for now – and are regaining their lives by stealth.By refusing to open up sooner, the government is losing its control of the population. But then was it ever really in control anyway? No doubt Matt Hancock, along with some of the Cabinet’s other native authoritarians, takes personal credit for tackling the Covid crisis by forcing people to socially-distance. Yet evidence points elsewhere: to the public leading the government in efforts to combat the pandemic, not the other way around. Some government advisers have taken to claiming that thousands of lives could have been saved had lockdown been imposed a week earlier than 23 March last year, the day a solemn Boris Johnson told us all to stay at home. But it is a pretty irrelevant argument given that the public had already largely placed itself in self-imposed lockdown.By the following Monday, when the government’s tone changed after the publication of the famous Imperial paper predicting up to 500,000 deaths form Covid, tube usage had already plunged to 60 per cent. By that Friday it had fallen to just 24 per cent as employers and employees between them made voluntary arrangements to work at home, and by the following Monday, ahead of Johnson’s evening address to the nation, it had plummeted to only 15 per cent. By the time lockdown was imposed, in other words, there wasn’t much left to lock down.Just as the public led the government into lockdown, so it is leading the government out of lockdown. Last weekend, car traffic was back up to 96 per cent of pre-pandemic levels – in spite of messages which still flicker, pointlessly, from motorway gantries telling us to “minimise travel”. Light commercial traffic is 14 per cent higher than it was before the pandemic.Those of us who have stood against endless lockdowns, and the petty laws and eyewatering fines used to try to enforce them, have been accused in some quarters of irresponsibility. Yet all we have been doing is appealing for the government to trust our own sense of responsibility rather than try to steamroller us into compliance. With some exceptions, people have shown themselves perfectly able to make their own, reasoned assessment of the risks posed by Covid, and of acting accordingly.The government’s input has been to tie up that process in regulatory knots, ending with bizarre legal debates as to whether a Scotch egg counts as a substantial meal and so on.There are serious dangers from trying to command the public into how to behave. As well as creating the bad feeling which surrounds any illiberal regime, living under endless orders blunts our sense of personal responsibility. Just look how some people rushed out to the pub in the few days before the second lockdown came into effect in November. The last chance to do something legally had encouraged them to take risks they wouldn’t have taken had they been left to themselves to decide what was and what wasn’t safe.There is little purpose to the remaining restrictions on our day to day lives. People can see that the vaccination programme has been a brilliant success and that their risk of coming to serious harm from Covid is now no higher than of succumbing to other diseases. They no longer see why their lives should be put on hold. It is about time the government caught up.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain us pledge preserve freedom seas huge operation indo","story":"Britain and America\u0027s navy chiefs said they were operating in lockstep to preserve the freedom of the seas as they met in Washington on Tuesday before a massive joint deployment to the Indo-Pacific region.The UK\u0027s First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, said the deployment of the new Carrier Strike Group (CSG) was a testament to the strength of the special relationship in an increasingly contested world, as well as a recognition of the economic advantages of the region.The programme represents the UK\u0027s biggest deployment of maritime and air power since the Falklands war.Adml Radakin said Britain plans to increase its naval presence in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of the recent integrated defence and security review.The defence review, which was published in March, identified China and Russia as two key global adversaries.We see China as being a challenge and a competitor, Adml Radakin told reporters at Washington\u0027s Navy Yard on Wednesday. I think when we talk about a tilt to the Indo-Pacific, it\u0027s about recognising the economic weight here. By 2040 to 2050, 40 per cent of the world\u0027s GDP is going to be harbored in that region.This amazing thing called the high seas, this global commons, which allows trade and prosperity to flourish, that exists all around the world. The Indo-Pacific is a crucial part of that. And therefore, we will look to signal our belief in the freedom of the high seas, and in a free and open Indo-Pacific.Read more: Defence review 2021: ‘Warhorses’ of the military put out to pasture as new era of fighting technology arrivesThe two-day visit is the first in-person event between Adml Radakin and his American counterpart, Admiral Mike Gilday, under the Biden administration.It comes as HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier begins its maiden deployment to the Indo-Pacific region this month, joined by a US Destroyer, USS The Sullivans, and a detachment of US Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II aircraft.The deployment to the Asia-Pacific region will see the CSG travel more than 26,000 nautical miles over 28 weeks.The CSG will visit 40 countries as part of the journey.HMS Queen Elizabeth will also sail through the South China Sea, which Beijing has become increasingly assertive over in recent years, on her way up to Japan for the final section of the trip.However, she is not expected to sail through the Taiwan Strait, which China would see as a provocation.Adml Radakin said Britain\u0027s tilt to the Indo-Pacific region included having a littoral-ready group operating at the western end of the Indian Ocean as well as reaching further East while building relationships with the Five Powers Defence Arrangements.However the First Sea Lord said the UK would also continue to be strong in the Euro-Atlantic as well as maintaining its naval responsibilities in other parts of the globe.Read more: HMS Queen Elizabeth: Britain\u0027s flagship aircraft carrier - from conception to deploymentMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"end pandering sinn fein ira","story":"Even by the brutal standards of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against the British security forces during the Troubles, Joe McCann, the gunman killed by paratroopers in 1972, had acquired a reputation as one of the organisation’s most ruthless killers.Jailed as a teenager after being found in possession of five bayonets in the 1960s long before Northern Ireland was consumed by sectarian violence, McCann quickly rose to become a senior IRA commander in Belfast.In this role, his unwavering support for the “armed struggle”, as he called it, saw him responsible for the murder of at least 10 British soldiers, as well as the attempted assassination of the Ulster Unionist politician John Taylor in February 1972.McCann’s insatiable appetite for acts of extreme violence led to him being top of the Royal Ulster Constabulary’s wanted list. Indeed, it has even been suggested that his violent conduct prompted more moderate figures in the IRA leadership to reveal his whereabouts in Belfast, resulting in his killing by British soldiers in April 1972.It is a supreme irony, therefore, that one of the IRA’s more renowned killers should now, nearly 50 years after he met his violent end, be feted as a cause celebre by the republicans, someone who, instead of being remembered for the catalogue of violence he wrought, is lauded as an innocent victim of British brutality.The fact that McCann is viewed in such terms is the by-product of both the republican movement’s success in being able to see dubious cases relating to the Troubles brought to court, and the failure of successive British governments to prevent them from doing so.There have been numerous pledges in Queen’s Speeches dating back a decade or more in which ministers have pledged to address the anomaly by which veterans who risked their lives in the service of their country during the Troubles find themselves liable to prosecution, while IRA terrorists responsible for some of the worst atrocities of the era have been granted immunity.The fundamental reason for this iniquitous state of affairs dates back to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, when Tony Blair, in his desperation to win republican support for the deal, in effect granted an amnesty to IRA terrorists, irrespective of the crimes they had committed. Mr Blair has subsequently argued that, without this concession, the deal would never have been struck.But it resulted in an estimated 200 “on-the-run” terrorists being sent letters providing assurances that they were no longer wanted by the police for their crimes. Among them was John Downey, who was accused of carrying out the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed 11 soldiers.While legions of IRA terrorists have been granted immunity from prosecution, it is a disgrace that no provision has been made to give similar protection to British service personnel who served during the Troubles, even though prime ministers from David Cameron through to Boris Johnson have promised to do so.There is an expectation that a pledge to provide better protection to veterans will be contained in next week’s Queen’s Speech outlining the Government’s goals. The concern, though, is that, as with previous promises, no effective action will ultimately be forthcoming.The simple reason for the Government’s reluctance to act is that, by affording veterans the same immunity from prosecution as IRA terrorists, Downing Street risks alienating Sinn Fein, the current standard-bearers of the republican cause whose support is deemed essential to maintaining the peace in Northern Ireland.Consequently, while the British authorities are prevented from prosecuting those responsible for some of the worst atrocities during the Troubles, Sinn Fein and their allies in Northern Ireland can persist with their persecution of British veterans even when, as this week’s collapse of the trial of the two paratroopers accused of murdering McCann has graphically demonstrated, the evidence is deeply flawed.Even though legal experts had given explicit warnings that there were serious flaws in the prosecution case several years ago, Barra McGrory, Northern Ireland’s then director of public prosecutions, insisted on proceeding.Mr McGrory has previously represented Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness, who are both alleged to have enjoyed close ties with the IRA. This has led to accusations that the trial of the two paratroopers was politically motivated, rather than an exercise in seeking justice.Certainly, with prosecutors in Northern Ireland said to be looking at pressing charges in another 200 cases involving veterans of the Troubles, there is an urgent need for the Government to take action to prevent further gross miscarriages of justice, instead of constantly pandering to the whims of Sinn Fein and its IRA supporters.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sending ships france might stunt good one","story":"To most of us, there is nothing wrong whatsoever with a PM standing up for Britain.

With thanks to PA Media and the Local Government Information Unit for parts of the information. Timings are only approximate estimates and could y wildly!  ENGLISH COUNCILS: More than , seats are up for grabs on  county,  unitary,  metropolitan and  district councils in England. Some are electing the whole council, some half their councillors and some only a third. Conservatives are defending slightly more seats while Labour are defending slightly more councils in control. But the Tories made big gains in , the last time many of these same seats were up for grabs - so Labour should be regaining this time. Boris Johnson has told Tory activists to brace for a tough night. Key battles will be over  councils in “no overall control”. More than half the seats up for grabswere meant to be elected in  but delayed due to Covid. Likewise, seats include  by-elections that were delayed by the pandemic. WHERE  Almost everywhere in England.SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT: All  seats are being chosen and Nicola Sturgeon will be hoping to win an overall majority - which she’s just short of now. Polls leave little doubt the SNP will be the largest party but Opinium say an overall majority is too close to call. If the nationalists up their seat tally from  to , they will push for a new independence referendum - seven years after last losing their fight. However, they’re also facing a fight with Alex Salmondaposs Alba party which wants a “super-majority” for independence. Labour, with new leader Anas Sarwar, is trailing in third place on  seats but isnapost expecting to leapfrog the Tories after hitting rock bottom last year - instead the party wants a  to rebuild. WHERE  Everywhere in Scotland.WELSH PARLIAMENT: All  seats are up for grabs and polls suggest Labour - while the biggest party - has an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. First Minister Mark Drakeford has ruled out an independence referendum as the price of any pact, but could need a deal with Plaid Cymru or the Lib Demshe’s to form a minority government. This is one of UKIP’s last outposts, where ex-Tory Neil Hamilton clings on for Nigel Farage’s old party even after he abandoned it. WHERE  Everywhere in Wales. ENGLISH MAYORS: Londonaposs mayoral election is the biggest but Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for an easy victory. The biggest battles are over Tory-held Tees Valley and West Midlands. Labour wants a Red Wall upset to seize West Midlands but hopes appear slim in Tees Valley. Voters are also electing two other metro mayors in Labour-held Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region. There are three combined authority mayoral elections - Tory-held West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, along with new mayoralty West Yorkshire., where Labour MP an ex-soap star Tracy Brabin wants a win. And finally five single-authority mayors - all currently held by Labour - are up for election in Bristol, Liverpool, Salford, Doncaster and North Tyneside. WHERE  Everywhere in the regions of Greater London, Greater Manchester, West Midlands, Tees Valley, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough. Plus Bristol, North Tyneside and Doncaster.HARTLEPOOL BY-ELECTION: The blockbuster Westminster ballot. Eyebrow-raising polls are tipping the Tories want to wipe out Labour’s , majority in the Brexit-backing northern seat - which has been red since its creation in  - with as much as a -point lead. If Labour candidate, the former MP Dr Paul Williams, fails Boris Johnson will hail it as a coup. Pollsters though point out the vote was split by the Brexit Party in , so the seat might otherwise have fallen to the Tories back then. WHERE  Only the Hartlepool Westminster constituency. LONDON ASSEMBLY: All  seats are up for election and Labour will be straining for an overall majority - the party’s currently one seat short on . Polling has suggested Labour is at least  points ahead of the Tories but the ‘list’ system introduces unknowns and allows voters to give a leg up to smaller parties. The Greens and ‘ Brexit Alliance’ each have two seats on the Assembly. WHERE  Everywhere in Greater London. POLICE COMMISSIONERS: The oft-forgotten jobs are up for election for the third time since they were created in . When they first emerged  were Independents but that shrank to just three in . Labour won  of the posts last time while the Tories won . But given their role as one single person overseeing police - and the fact many are being declared last - these jobs will end up as a sideshow to the main political news of election weekend.

Polls close across Great Britain and counting starts for the Hartlepool by-election, Doncaster mayor and  of  English councils. Unlike in normal years, most results will only start being counted on Friday morning - and in some cases much later. This is because there are more elections than usualand counting is much slower .Friday  May: From amResults start trickling in from the  overnight councils in England.They include Derby which has swung from Labour to Tory-run no overall controlin recent years. And Southend has been run by a Labour, Lib Dem and Green ‘rainbow coalition’ since the Tory leader was voted out in . Likewise the Tories only need a few gains to take back Colchester from a Labour-Lib Dem coalition.Harlow is solidly Labour-controlled but has backed Conservatives in the past - could it slip into NOC on a good night for Tories  Labour meanwhile will be eyeing Thurrock , run by Tories but which has swung back and forth into NOC over the years. And the Tories seized Redditch from Labour in , so on a good night Keir Starmer’s party would want to make in-roads there. Labour strongholds Gateshead , Newcastle, Knowsley, Sunderland, Oldham, South Tyneside and Rochdale all declare early. Friday  May: From am The Hartlepool by-election result is due around am. If the Tories overturn Labour’s , majority and claim the Westminster seat for the first time in its history, it will likely lead the day’s news and be a big political headache for Keir Starmer. We should get our first mayor result in the Doncaster mayoral election, currently held by Labour. And we could get some of the most interesting of the overnight council results, including Dudley where Labour and the Tories are almost neck-and-neck. Also declaring at sunrise are Stockport , a Labour-Lib Dem split in NOC, and Nuneaton  Bedworth which could go red, blue or NOC. On a good night the Tories will want to seize control of Northumberland where they rule in a minority. Friday  May: From amIf you’ve stayed up overnight, go to bed. No more results are likely during the morning. But from am, counting begins for an avalanche of races - all  seats for the Welsh Parliament, half the London Assembly,  of the  constituencies for the Scottish Parliament, and  councils in England. Counting also starts for three of the  elections for police and crime commissioners, and the Liverpool mayor. Friday  May: From Noon Lunchtime council results start rolling in, including Burnley where Labour only needs one more seat to take control. Tories only need small gains to take control of Bolton but it won’t be an easy fight. Red fortress Manchester declares in the early afternoon as do less strongly Labour-held Rossendale and Tory Devon .Castle Point is a straight fight between Tories and the powerful Canvey Island independents who want their own council. Meanwhile we’ll get the mayor of Liverpool, a Labour stronghold but home to a furious row over the party’s selection of their candidate.Many of the most important Scottish Parliament results will roll in at some point on Friday afternoon.They include Dumbarton where Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie clung on by whisker against the SNP in . Labour are likewise fighting hard to defend Edinburgh Southern and East Lothian against an SNP challenge. Despite speculation of a three-way fight, they believe either the SNP or Tories will take Edinburgh Central .Eastwood was a three-way fight in , won by the Scottish Tories. The big name race is in Glasgow Southside where new leader Anas Sarwar is challenging First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. He’ll lose, but get in on the regional list system instead and Labour are hoping to dent the SNP majority.Friday  May: From pmWe’re due the first results from Wales, including the Parliament’s most marginal seat Llanelli where Plaid Cymru are challenging Labour. Welsh Labour will also be fighting off the Tories in Wrexham , a key brick in a so-called red wall.Elsewhere, we’ll start getting the first seven results for the London Assembly and the first police commissioners in Avon and Somerset and Staffordshire. And an avalanche of English council results begins as the afternoon wears on. Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire turned blue recently and a strong Labour performance should at least kick them into NOC. Ex-minister Edwina Currie - yes her! - is standing against Labour ex-MP Ruth George to become a Derbyshire councillor. Seizing back Trafford from the Tories was Labour’s big victory in  so the party must hold on now to avoid a reverse humiliation.Cornwall is run by a Lib Dem-Independent coalition but the Tories have the most seats and will be hoping to gain. Ex-UKIP territory Basildon will be a hard Labour-Tory fight but could stay in NOC. On a bad night for Labour the party could lose Bury , Sheffield or West Lancashire to NOC, while Tories could gain Maidstone in a tussle with Lib Dems. Tories have no seats in Sheffield or Sandwell - will they up their count to one Friday  May: From pm The Tees Valley metro mayor result is due, with Tory Ben Houchen tipped to hang on against his Labour challenger in the former ‘red wall’. And in Wales we’ll get the Labour marginals of Caerphilly and Vale of Clwyd where Plaid and Tories respectively are putting up a fight. Lib Dems are also defending their only seat in Brecon and Radnorshire - and will Rhondda stay Plaid in the Valleys Over in England, about  councils are due to declare in the space of just  minutes.The biggest races include Norfolk , Cambridgeshire , Essex, counties up for all-out election that are Tory-run but could give Labour inroads.Cambridge also has all its seats up for election in a battle between Labour and the Lib Dems. On good nights for the main parties, Labour could win Wirral and Crawley or the Tories could win Pendle and Elmbridge from NOC. Labour’s first county, Durham , should stay red - as should Doncaster but the Tories might look for small in-roads asall its seats are up. Labour only need to lose a few seats in Plymouth to lose to NOC but the Tories wouldn’t be able to form a majority. Likewise Tory-run Walsall could fall to NOC on a bad night for Boris Johnson.Solihull is unusual - it’s Tory-run but with a Green opposition and the Conservatives will lose controlthey’re docked one seat.Friday  May: From pmMore than a dozen final results flood in for the Welsh Parliament, making clear whether Labour will need to form a coalition.Key declarations include Tory target Vale of Glamorgan and First Minister Mark Drakeford’s seat Cardf West. Likewise by the end of the night we’ll have results for  of the  Scottish Parliament seats, giving some early indication of whether Nicola Sturgeon’s on course for an outright majority.About a dozen more English council results should come in during the evening including Hull, where Labour want to keep Lib Dems at bay.Mole Valley has slim Lib Dem control with a Tory and Independent challenge while Worcester could go Tory or Labour.No results are expected overnight on Friday unless a particular council chooses to push things late into the night.Saturday  May: From amNormally elections would be over by Saturday - but counting will resume in earnest this year. But go out for brunch or something - the results shouldn’t roll in until noon or so. There will be all remaining constituency seats and all regional seats in Scotland,  councils in England, the rest of the London Assembly and at least  police commissioners. Counts will also begin in the mayoral elections for London, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, North Tyneside, Salford, the West of England and the West Midlands.Saturday  May: From Noon The first results from the  English councils counting on Saturday, including Lancashire which the Tories took from NOC in . Aside from this there may be few surprises in England until later in the afternoon. Oxford and North Tyneside are both Labour while Shropshire, Worcester, Broxbourne and Hertfordshire are all Tory . Eastleigh is solidly Lib Dem. We could get the Liverpool City mayor and the North Tyneside mayor , both likely Labour, and the West of England mayor , which the Tories won by a slim margin in . In Scotland we should get results in Aberdeenshire West, which the Tories took from the SNP by a slim margin in , and key target seat Perthshire South which the Tories want to take from the SNP this time. Saturday  May: From pm The key result for the West Midlands mayor - which Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne wants to seize from Tory incumbent Andy Street. If he can pull it off it’d be a key symbolic victory for Keir Starmer in territory where the Tories gained much ground under Corbyn.We should get results from mid-afternoon for the rest of the London Assembly constituencies, but the mayor will only be later in the evening.We should however get confirmation ‘king of the north’ Andy Burnham has been re-elected as Greater Manchester mayor . And results for  police and crime commissioners are likely. The results for the Salford mayor are also due. About  more English council results should flood in mid to late afternoon including Hartlepool, where the Tories are part of a complex coalition and turnout should be high due to the by-election. Labour need just three seats to take control of Kirklees but the Tories have previously gained ground in the area. Meanwhile the Lib Dems would only need a few seats to seize Gosport from the Conservatives.Milton Keynes is a three-way fight between Labour and the Lib Dems, currently in coalition under NOC, and the Tories. The Lib Dems and Tories will both be vying to retake NOC Portsmouth while the Lib Dems and Labour will want to regain seats they lost in Tory Wiltshire. Stroud is interesting - NOC with a rainbow coalition of Labour, Greens and Lib Dems but Tories are the largest party. And Rotherham doesn’t have a single Tory, will it stay that way "},{"url":null,"title":"local elections 2021 live polls","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [local elections .

Scientists say the male sex hormones called androgens - that cause hair loss - make them more susceptible. It could explain the gender gap in deaths, with men twice as likely to succumb to the disease and the discovery could revolutionise treatment of patients and slash mortality rates.Men carrying mutations sensitive to androgens - which include testosterone - were found to be prone to worse coronavirus symptoms, researchers say.Scientists have also found similar results in women who are losing their hair due to androgens. A US team noticed  per cent of hospitalised patients had androgenetic alopecia - commonly known as male pattern baldness. This was dramatically disproportionate to the  to  percent in a similar age-matched population. The condition is caused by iants in a gene called AR, which regulates a protein known as TMPRSS - that is implicated in coronavirus. A study of  men hospitalised with the infection showed those with low CAG levels were at less risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit. Researchers say this could be a game-changer in combatting the pandemic. Lead author Dr Andy Goren, chief medical officer at Applied Biology, Inc, Irvine, Calornia, said: Our data show longer AR CAG scores are associated with more severe COVID- disease. The identication of a biomarker connected with the androgen receptor is another piece of evidence highlighting the important role of androgens in COVID- disease severity. The researchers also identied a promising therapy using a novel drug that blocks the androgen receptor.

Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, wrote on Twitter : Hospitality and tourism has missed out on almost all bank holidays last year and the start of this.An extra bank holiday would be a boost to business, the economy, jobs and investment.

Were you affected by the demonstration  Let us know at webnews@mirror.Jersey property developer Jonathan Ruff claims a French trawler deliberately rammed his boat as he went out to face the flotilla to stick up for the island and do his patriotic duty.

Mr Ruff, who runs restaurants and wants to open a casino and strip club on the island, accused the French captain of being totally reckless.

At one point during the demonstration, a member of the Jersey Militia re-enactment group shot a blank-firing musket towards the water from Elizabeth Castle. The sight of dozens of French fishing vessels approaching the British Crown dependency as flares shot up into the sky looked “like an invasion”, said Jersey fisherman Josh Dearing. The -year-old, who owns The Jersey Catch fishing company and is originally from Kent, said the scene was “was quite a sight”. He added: “There were probably about  boats. There were a few hand-held flares and smoke flares going off and apparently a few maybe bangers and stuff going off from the French. It was impressive, I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion.” There had been rumblings about a planned protest a few days ago, Mr Dearing said, but added that he had not been sureit was “serious or empty threats”. He said: “The French being the French, they don’t mess around. They can blockade their own harbours – they wouldn’t think twice about coming and doing it to us.” Mr Dearing was “absolutely” pleased to hear on Wednesday night that Royal Navy vessels were being deployed to patrol the waters around Jersey. He said: “We’re completely unprotected in Jersey. We’ve got nothing except for a few police officers. We don’t have a police boat, we don’t have a navy boat, we don’t have anything to protect us. “The French can be hostile. All of our livelihoods are in that harbour andthey wanted to they could cause damage.” The Royal Navy patrol boats HMS Severn and HMS Tamar were positioned some distance away. France sent two police boats - Athos and Themis - to patrol the area, but they did not approach the flotilla or the Royal Navy ships.  A spokeswoman for the French maritime authority for the Channel and the North Sea said they were being stationed to be in a position to intervene “as quickly as possible”the situation worsens. Jersey’s external relations minister, Ian Gorst, said talks between island ministers and the organisers of the protest were “positive”.He told BBC Radio aposs World at One programme: “It really is important that what has escalated over the course of the last three days, that we move away from that escalation and disproportionate threats, and start to deal with those detailed technical issues.The row began after Jersey implemented new requirements under the terms of the UK-EU trade deal for boats to submit evidence of their past fishing activities in order to receive a licence to carry on operating in Jersey waters.

There is of course no “right” or “normal” way to grieve – everyone will experience their own emotional journey following a bereavement. We shouldn’t be putting pressure on ourselves to experience a certain sensation – like anger or acceptance – at a certain time, says Andy Langford, clinical director at Cruse Bereavement Care. Instead, we should be giving ourselves time and space.But it can be particularly hard when you live alone. The following advice from Co-op Funeralcare might help:Keep talking One thing that can give comfort is talking about your feelings with friends or family, so it’s important not to become isolated. Stay connected Use video and phone calls and social media to stay in touch. Arrange times to chat with people – having this in your diary can add something to look forward to and purpose to your day.  Stick to a routine As much as possible, try to get up at the same time each day, and prepare and eat meals when you normally would. If you can, get outside to exercise. Don’t be too ambitious Set yourself manageable tasks. Sometimes that will simply be getting out for a walk. Getting the balance right between being busy as a distraction and taking the time to focus on your grief is key. Look after your health Maintaining healthy habits for your physical wellbeing can help with your emotional welfare.

Thanks to their wealth and notoriety, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will have a range of experts available to themneeded when their baby girl arrives and they juggle raising two young children and holding down careers. Given their multi-million pound deals with Netflix and Spoty, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex can afford to have a day nanny and a night nanny, and extra help from the likes of a maternal wellbeing therapist or a nutritionist, say parenting experts. Heavily-pregnant Meghan, , is due to give birth this summer, reportedly as soon as early June, and royal watchers expect she will lean on her mum Doria Ragland, , for help. The girl will join birthday boy Archie, who turns two today, and be the Sussexesapos second child since their wedding in . The American duchess gave birth to son Archie at the exclusive and private Portland hospital in London in May , and rumours have suggested she could opt for a home birth in the coupleaposs mansion in suburban Los Angeles this time. Ms Ragland, who spent time with the couple at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor after Archieaposs birth, lives close to the couple and is expected to provide similar support when her granddaughter is born. Harryaposs family is , miles away and he relies on video calls to keep in touch with the Queen and other family members who are still speaking to him amid a rt that was widened by the Sussexesapos bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. Meghan is estranged from her father Thomas Markle Snr, who is orced from her mother, and her paternal half-siblings Thomas Markle Jnr and Samantha Markle. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. With limited family support, the Sussexes will have their hands full as they raise two children while running their documentary and podcast empire, and doing charity work. When Archie was born, reports claimed Meghan and Harry had just one nanny for him, but had tried out three in his first three months. Parenting experts said the Sussexes could turn to multiple nannies and other experts for help with their two children, especiallyMeghan doesnapost take a y period of maternity leave. Sophie Pickles, an early years teacher and parenting coach, told the Mirror: “Meghan and Harry may choose to hire a team of two or more nannies to help care for Archie and the new baby. “It is not uncommon for royals or the extremely wealthy to do so, often employing one nanny to stay in the house overnight to help with frequent night wakes and one or more to take care of the children during the day. “We know that when Archie was born, Meghan and Harry decided to hire a nanny to help them after initially saying they wouldnapost do so. “As for all of us, it sometimes takes until the baby is born for new parents to realise what a challenge it can be.” She added: “We already know that Harry and Meghan have stated that they do not want their home to be filled with staff, so it is unlikely that the new nanny will live with them. “All parents of multiple children know, however, that two is more challenging than one and with Archie about to hit the tumultuous age of two, they may well change their minds.”  It’s not known how much time self-employed Meghan and Harry will take from work off following the birth of their baby girl. As for how they could do things dferently this time, the couple could lean more on Ms Ragland and close friends. Ms Pickles said: “With Meghanaposs mum living close by, it is likely that she will be called upon to offer support and help, not only for Meghan as she recovers from birth but in caring for Archie while the family adjusts to having a new member. “After all, even when you have all the money in the world, there is nothing quite like the reassurance of leaving your baby in the arms of someone that you love and trust.” Royal biographer Angela Levin said itaposs possible the Sussexes will have more help around them after this birth, given they will have two children to take care of while running a business and doing charity work. The author of Harry: Conversations with the Prince told the Mirror: Meghan’s mother will want to help them and be involved, and the second one will be very close to her. I thinkwill rethink those early weeks . First-time mothers think they can do everything themselves. She might well have a night nanny and day nanny to help her, particularlyshe is working. You can’t juggle two in the same way that you can juggle one. I imagine a lot of money will come rolling in before she gives birth. They will be able to afford it.  Meghan and Harry, , are fortunate to have the kind of wealth and celebrity status that provide a gateway to experts and services most parents could never afford. The rich and famous in Los Angeles aren’t afraid to hire help or spend ridiculous amounts of money to get aposthe bestapos for their newborn.After her daughter Stormi Webster was born in February , reports claimed Kylie Jenner had four nannies.Kim Kardashian is said to have an “army” of nannies to help her care for the four children she had with Kanye West.Ms Pickles said: “While some of us can seek the services of sleep or lactation consultants for a one-off session, Meghan and Harry would be able to hire personal advisors to answer questions day and night. “They could take the form of an occupational therapist, paediatric doctors and physiotherapists, day and night nannies, a parent coach, a sleep consultant, a lactation consultant or a family counsellor - not to mention a personal trainer specialising in postpartum exercise, a nutritionist, a chef and a housekeeper.”  Lucy Shrimpton, founder of the Sleep Nanny, said Meghan and Harry could try to take on as much as they can on their own. She said: “Meghan and Harry are in a very privileged position that they have the means to pay for as much help as they could possibly need. “However, Meghan and Harry may want to do it as much as possible on their own. They seem like a very tight family, not afraid to get their hands dirty when it comes to all parenting responsibilities so they may try to be as self sufficient as possible.” Help from a sleep expert could set them up for long-term benefits such as the child’s development, and the familyaposs health and mental wellbeing. Ms Shrimpton added: “Being prepared with lots of rest before the baby arrives will be hugely beneficial for Meghan and Harry because the demands on parents of two will more than double. “Speaking from experience, where I went into labour already shattered with a -month-old, having plenty of time to rest beforehand will make a huge dference.  “Itaposs not as easy to catch up on sleep after having a baby when you have a toddler too. They may need to consider Archieaposs sleep and any adjustments to make to ensure he is not unsettled by the new sibling arriving into his world and demanding the attention of his parents.” Awena Naomie Ella, a matrescence specialist, motherhood wellbeing coach and occupational therapist, said Meghan could benefit from a specialist such as a maternal wellbeing therapist, who can help to set boundaries that allow for “rest, calm and connection”. She said: “Itaposs important to be aware of the hormonal, psychological, physiological, emotional, and spiritual changes a woman will move through. “Meghan’s wellbeing is the key to a safe and enjoyable entrance into this next phase of her and Harry’s le. “It is also important not to neglect or fail to acknowledge the emotional and wellbeing needs of Harry too. Ms Ella added: “Having access to a maternal wellbeing therapist or motherhood specialist, for example, can aid and support Meghan to embrace some simple and gentile wellbeing activates that fit into her current lestyle, and help her to prevent and manage any anxiety, possible onset of depression, overwhelm, and loss of sense of self that can sometimes come with early motherhood.

Many fans have praised the book and thousands have already pre-ordered a copy. However Majesty magazineaposs Ingrid Seward believes that one of the pages shows the coupleaposs feelings towards Harry losing his royal military positions following Megxit. The beautul illustration shows a ginger hair dad dressed in Army unorm being reunited with his son, who he throws in the air, while the mum watches on through the window.  Writing for the Sun, Ingrid points out that this is something Archie has never seen, adding: Maybe Meghan is sending us a coded message that Harry has still not got over losing his military titles after the Queen stepped in.She also accuses Meghan of being hypocritical for writing a book about fatherhoods when she is still not speaking to her own. Her relationship with Thomas Markle has been dficult since the royal wedding but things were made worse when he gave a copy of her emotional handwritten letter to the Mail on Sunday.  Ingrid writes: Nor am I surprised at Meghan’s hypocrisy in writing a book about the joy of father and son bonding when the relationship between Harry and his own father Prince Charles has been brought to an all-time low by their Oprah interview. Meghan’s estranged dad, Thomas, lives roughly  miles away but she has not taken Harry or Archie to see him. I suspect Mr Markle believes they never will make that journey or repair the relationship.Royal author Phil Dampier agrees with Ingrid, telling The Sun : Meghan is probably showing how much the Army meant to Harry and how upset he is to lose his military titles.For Harry, who put his le on the line and then founded the highly successful Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women, losing the titles was the bitterest part of ‘Megxit.’  The Bench is being released through publisher Random House, and the cover features her royal title, The Duchess of Sussex. In a statement, Meghan said: The Bench started as a poem I wrote for my husband on Fatheraposs Day, the month after Archie was born,aposapos Meghan said in a statement. That poem became this story. My hope is that The Bench resonates with every family, no matter the makeup, as much as it does with mine.” It is narrated by award winning artist Christian Robinson Meghan, who is described as a mother, we, feminist and activist in the bio, will narrate the audiobook.

Sophie Bugg, , was  weeks pregnant when she popped to the loo in the middle of the night - only to leave the bathroom with a baby less than a minute later. Her partner Chris, , had to act fast as Sophie appeared outside the bathroom door with the babyaposs head between her legs. With just one big push, baby Millie was born into her astonished dadaposs arms. Despite her extremely quick arrival, she is doing well with her family at their home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Full time mum-of-three Sophie said: She was ridiculously fast! One moment Iaposm texting my friend on the toilet about needing a poo and seconds later, Iaposve got a baby in my arms. Actually pushing her out from when the lady on the phone told me to push only lasted  seconds, it was so fast. I had no pains and my waters hadnapost broken, there was no realisation I was having her at all. It sounds really crude but it just felt like I needed to go for a poo.Have you got a birth story  Email webnews@mirrorI had messaged my friend saying I donapost feel great, then put the phone down from where I was sat on the loo and went to get up from the toilet. As I went to lt myself up, my body just got that feeling like I needed to push for a poo. So I sat back down, pushed, and as soon as I did that push, I knew it was not from behind! I put my hand between my legs and her head was completely out. I shouted to my partner for help, went from the toilet to outside my toilet door on the top of the stairs, did one push and she was out! This isnapost the first time that Sophie has been taken by surprise by her speedy deliveries.  Back in , the mum went to the toilet in the middle of the night and ended up delivering her first baby, Paige, now eight, just  minutes later. Little Paige was born still in her sac, which is why Sophieaposs waters didnapost break, and a paramedic was able to pop the sac safely. Sophie was then booked in for an induction for her second child Lexie, now two, to ensure she was in hospital this time around. She gave birth to Lexie just  minutes after being induced.  She said: My first baby was quite an experience - you donapost expect anything like that with your first labour, to just be at home and then all of a sudden youaposve got a baby. You donapost know what to expect. You get told all these dferent things from people like youaposre going to have a show, youaposll have waters go, so youaposre waiting for these things to happen and they didnapost for me so I didnapost think I was giving birth until her head was out. My second baby, the doctors were so worried with the fact of how quickly I had my first that they had me induced so I was in hospital with my second, which was a relief. But then my third baby had the exact same plans as my first, but came even quicker! I couldnapost believe how quickly she arrived.  My body doesnapost give me the signs of labour. My midwe and my consultant told me that I go from zero to baby, I donapost dilate like every normal person does. Sophie had been booked in to be induced a whole week before Millie was born but the cheeky little girl decided she was ready to come even earlier. Two days before her planned induction, Sophie woke up in the early hours of the morning on March  with the urge to go to the toilet. She texted her friend to say she didnapost feel well and that she was going to go into the garden for some fresh air but her pal quickly warned her not to in case she gave birth.  But by the time her friendaposs advice came through on her phone, Sophie had already given birth to her newborn after pushing out her head instead of a aposnumber twoapos. She did one more big push outside the toilet door with her panicked partner Chris, who works as a storeman, in front of her - and baby Millie was born. Sophie said: I sat on the toilet, literally did a push and had the feeling that I should feel between my legs because it didnapost feel like a poo. I put my hand down and I just felt her head! It was four in the morning, it was just so unexpected. I was calling Chrisapos name as her head came out but so much energy was going into me giving birth, I felt like the lady off of Titanic, shouting aposhelpapos but it wasnapost coming out loud enough! I thought heaposs not going to wake up but then when I got off the toilet, he was stood there in the doorway so he must have heard me. I just looked at him and said aposyouaposve got to do the rest!apos His face dropped but then the phone came out, he was talking to the paramedics, it all happened so fast.  My two other kids both woke up in the commotion as well so I had my eight year old poking her head round her bedroom door asking aposMummy, are you ok apos Iaposm like aposyeah, Iaposm ok darling, just stay in your room for a minute!apos I went from sat on the toilet to outside my toilet door on the top of the stairs, did one push and she was out! I asked Chris afterwardshe was alright and he was like aposyeah, that was mad!apos Sophie remained on top of her stairs cradling her new born with the placenta still inside her for  minutes before a paramedic arrived. The umbilical cord was cut and Sophie and Millie were taken to hospital to be checked over but were released after a couple of hours in perfect health. Sophie said: I was shocked when I gave birth to my first so quickly but Iaposm just in disbelief that I ended up giving birth at home once again and even quicker! I had no pain relief with two of my kids and the after-pain with my third was terrible from where I was straining so much because I thought she was a poo. I was left so sore for weeks - I literally felt like a baboon!  I hear peopleaposs stories and I know several people who have been in labour for  hours and I canapost possibly imagine that! Iaposve never experienced that - my longest labour was  minutes and Iaposve had three children. I do feel sorry for these people who have to go through it!

People in Cornwall have always put jam on first while folk in neighbouring Devon start with the clotted cream. Disgusted customers contacted Sainsburyaposs to complain, and as a result the supermarket chain apologised and quietly removed the photo from the baked goods aisle, CornwallLive reports. Who does a cream tea the proper way - Cornwall or Devon  Join the conversation in the comments section below. An empty frame now hangs on the wall where the picture was displayed. Sainsburyaposs said it had nothing more to say about the saga, which went viral. Earlier, Sainsburyaposs had said: Our afternoon tea has all scone wrong in Truro! We are reviewing the customer feedback we have received. Andreas Drosiadis, who took the original photo and runs the Mediterraneo deli in Truro, posted the image on Facebook asking: How did this happen   Andreas, , said: England is a country with strong local traditions that shape our everyday le. Jam first is a characteristic example of this and Sainsburyaposs should have known better. CornwallLive, a Mirror sister website, joined the furore, tweeting: Sainsburyaposs whataposs this  A fruit scone! with the cream on first! advertised in a Cornish store.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Which store did you see this please  Weaposll have a word with them about this blasphemy! After learning of the store location, Sainsburyaposs added: Thataposll never do at all Truro! Iaposve logged some feedback to the manager of the store to ensure they are made aware of this imposter and repair it accordingly.  Andreasapos tweet went viral and renewed the debate over how to dress a scone - is it jam first or clotted cream  Originally from Greece, the deli owner said: Because the clotted cream is denser than the jam, the jam should go first and the clotted cream after so everything stays neat and clean without the jam pouring on your fingers. He added: We now have the British authority on etiquette to back up the argument. Thataposs how the Queen has it. On Twitter user wrote: Sainsburyaposs are correct. When you have jam on toast do you put the butter on after the jam...

Speaking at the time, Kaitlyn told the Daily Record: We can’t believe it to be honest, my phone has been going off the hook. “I always upload videos like this but this has never happened, it’s crazy. “Millie is loving it and thinks she’s famous, which was funny until I told her it was her bedtime and she replied ‘you can’t speak to a famous person like that’.  “We’ve been contacted by loads of people from places like Poland and Italy who said they loved her accent. “It was quite surreal because I had to use google translate to work out what they were saying.” Mum-of-two Caitlyn revealed Millie’s outburst is not typical and she’s usually “very quiet”.

Hopes a chilly April would give way to a warmer May are yet to be realised, as forecasters predict another washout is in store. But lucky punters in some areas should get a break from the wintry conditions by Sunday. A aposmini-heatwaveapos with highs of C is forecast to bless London and some areas of South East England by the end of the weekend while almost everywhere  gets lashed by wind and rain, the Met Office says. The grim prediction comes after the UK shivered through the coldest early May bank holiday weekend on record. Frosty temperatures hit many parts of the country, with -.C recorded at Kinbrace in the Highlands in Scotland - matching the  May bank holiday record. And this weekend is not looking much sunnier for most parts of the country as the spring chill lingers at a time when coronavirus lockdown restrictions continue to restrict socialising to outdoor mixing. While the wintry snap is set to be replaced by a warmer weekend, it will be wetter and windier, forecasters have warned. A band of snowy showers - along with a chance of hail and thunder - are likely to continue into Friday.  Spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said snowfall was not that unusual in England in May, with some as recently as last year, but lying snow was much more uncommon for the time of year. The last time snow accumulated in any quantity at this time in May was in , when several centimetres settled in Scotland, Wales and northern England. Ms Maxey said: Through spring you get these swings in weather types. So itaposs not unusual to see a cold snap through April and May. During those cold snaps you potentially see a bit of falling snow but generally over higher ground and generally in the north.  She said snow settling was much more rare as the ground is warming up, evenit does not feel like it. Temperatures are rising during the day and, eventheyaposre not rising to what we expect in April and May, they are warm enough to melt snow. Ms Maxey said the sun is also quite strong at this time of year, meaning some people are suffering sunburn on clear days even though it feels quite close. She said more snow and hail showers could be expected on Friday, but temperatures will rise at the weekend when a cold air mass is nudged out of the way by a warmer system from the Atlantic.  But Ms Maxey said the weather will be giving with one hand and taking with the other as this system will bring wind and rain on Saturday. She said: At the weekend weaposve got one of these low pressure systems coming in which pushes the high pressure out of the way and allows the temperatures to rise a bit but brings some wet and windy weather. It pushes in from the South West on Saturday morning and by Saturday evening it will have reached as far as the north of Scotland. You will see temperatures pushing up a bit then and ing more to normal with the South East potentially seeing temperatures as high as C just for Saturday. But weaposll see some rain and breezy conditions and some of that rain could be quite heavy. Ms Maxey said places like Dartmoor could see as much as mm of rain in the  hours to Saturday.

She said: A mostly dry start for much of England where we will see some sunshine but it will be chilly. The temperatures will yet again struggle, itaposs going to be a chilly day. It comes after widespread rain, hailstones and even lightning were seen across the country on Wednesday. Looking ahead to the coming days Alex Burkill, a Met Office forecaster, said: For the rest of the week, rainfall will be rather hefty in some places, with as much as -mm falling in just an hour in the worst-affected spots.  A signicant amount of hail could potentially cause some disruption to roads and public transport. He said heavy downpours will then lash the country on Saturday. He added: Most areas will be affected by heavy and persistent rain and strong winds over the weekend. Sunday should be drier for most, with some showers in places, but in the south-east of England, temperatures could climb into the low twenties by the afternoon.  People should make the most of any dry or sunny spots, as it is unlikely to last and the rest of May will be unsettled and changeable for everyone.

A year later, the couple are carving out a new le including million-dollar business deals, celebrity pals and a Calornian mansion. In their quitting statement, Meghan and Harry said they planned to raise Archie with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born but with space to focus on the next chapter. To mark his second birthday, weaposve taken a look at what Archieaposs post-royal le is like and how it dfers to his cousins Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Family While Archie is growing up on the other side of the Atlantic to his royal family, heaposs just up the road from his other grandmother - Meghanaposs mum Doria. The Duchess is extremely close to her mum and she was in the room supporting her daughter through Archieaposs birth. Itaposs likely that Doria has played a big role in Archieaposs le so far and spends lots of time with him.  However the distance means heaposs not been able to enjoy the company of Charles and Camilla, nor his Uncle William or Auntie Kate. While Harry was reunited with his family at his grandfather Prince Philipaposs funeral last month, Archie and heavily pregnant Meghan stayed at home. However Archie has been able to see his cousins, aunt and uncle, and grandparents via video call during the pandemic.The Sussexes also spoke regularly to the Queen and Prince Philip before his death last month.Photos and the public eyeWhile Kate and William release photos of their children, Meghan and Harry have unsurprisingly shared far fewer images of their son since quitting royal le.The couple decided against the tradition of posing for photos on the hospital steps following the birth and instead arranged a photocall for a small group of the media a few days later. The couple also kept the christening as a private celebration but released two official photos from the day.Before shutting down their Sussex Royal Instagram page they shared a handful of snaps, including a picture of his foot in front of Princess Dianaaposs favourite flowers to mark Motheraposs Day and one of Archie and Charles on the Prince of Walesaposs birthday.Since stepping down Meghan and Harry have used the publication of new photos to promote charities they are passionate about.For his first birthday, they shared an adorable video of Meghan reading her son his favourite book, Rabbit! Duck!. Love the royals for our daily royal newsletter by clicking here.It was shared as part of Save the Childrenaposs Save with Stories campaign, which aims to raise funds for children and families struggling due to the coronavirus crisis in the UK and around the world.They stuck with the royal familyaposs tradition of sharing a Christmas photo, however used a digitally sketched picture rather than a photo. The arty card, which shows the couple, Archie and their two dogs playing in a Wendy house, was released in partnership with animal welfare charity Mayhew, which Meghan is patron of.  Archie also appears in one of the two photos released by the couple when they announced they are expecting their second child, a baby girl.Archie also made a guest appearance on his parentsapos debut podcast for Archewell Audio.After speaking to the likes of Sir Elton John and James Cordon on the holiday special, the proud parents brought little Archie to the microphone, with Harry saying: You can speak into it. Meghan then asks: Archie is it fun  and he repeats the word fun. The tot then copies his dad to say Happy New Year, followed by an adorable giggle. The couple shared a rare video of Archie playing on the beach as part of their controversial interview with Oprah Winfrey.  Home leIf the Sussexes had stayed in the UK, Archie would have grown up in the stunning Frogmore Cottage.The house, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, was a wedding gt to Meghan and Harry from the Queen.  Before this, there had been plans for the couple to move into one of the bigger apartments in Kensington Palace, just a few doors up from the Cambridges. This would have allowed Archie to spend a lot of time with his cousins and other family members. But instead, little Archie spent a few months in Canada before Meghan and Harry moved into movie producer Tyler Perryaposs LA house.Last summer they bought their first proper family home, a stunning £.million pad in Montecito, Santa Barbara."},{"url":null,"title":"inside archies birthday celebrations meghan","story":"NewsInside Archies birthday celebrations with Meghan, Harry and royal Zoom callsArchie has turned two years old and will be celebrating his second birthday at the multi-million pound luxury mansion he shares with parents Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in CalorniamirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsFans will be hoping to see fresh pictures of rarely young Archie as he marks his second birthday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Senior royals are expected to put aside their rt with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for at least a few hours mark their sonaposs special milestone.The couple are living with Archie in a multimillion-pound luxury mansion in Montecito, Calornia, where he will turn two today more than , miles away from his royal relatives in Britain. The Sussexes are expected to celebrate the toddleraposs birthday with a Zoom call to his grandmother, the Queen, and a call with his aunt and uncle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. While fans eagerly wait to see whether they Sussexes will release any special new photos of rarely seen Archie on his big day, his loved ones have already wished the youngster a happy birthday publicly.The Queen, in a message on the official royal family Twitter account, accompanied by a photograph of her great-grandson with his parents days after he was born, said: Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy nd birthday today.Also sending him warm tidings from afar, Harryaposs brother, Kate and William wished Archie a very happy birthday, alongside another christening photo showing the family together. Charles and his we, Camilla the Duchess of Cornwall, shared a photo of Harry proudly showing Archie off to the childaposs grandfather at his christening.  Speaking to OK, royal author Katie Nicholl said: “Harry... always wanted his children to grow up close to William and Kate’s. That would be the childhood he enjoyed with his own cousins, Zara, Beatrice and Eugenie. Sadly it’s looking increasingly unlikely for Archie.“Very little is known about how much the brothers have spoken in recent months and what the situation is between them, but I find it hard to imagine that the Cambridges won’t at least pick up the phone on Archie’s birthday.” Ms Nicholl also speculated a video call with Her Majesty will take place on her grandsonaposs birthday.  She said: “We know that Harry still speaks regularly with his grandmother and one of the Queen’s joys is to see Archie. I’m sure there will be a Zoom call with her on his special day,” she says.

The never-seen-before black and white footage showed him walking along a beach watched by his parents and the familyaposs pet dog, Guy. As he walked towards his father, who filmed the moment, the youngster ducked down and walked through the gap in his legs.The couple also offered fresh insights into his le Stateside during the explosive interview.Harry revealed details including that Archie likes being taken on bike rides in his baby seat, where he sticks his arms out and shouts woooo and points out passing sights. Meghan said Archie,has been on a roll in learning to talk, and his current favourite word is hydrate. Harry recently told James Corden that Archieaposs first word was crocodile. When Archie made a surprise appearance in the Sussexesapos first podcast for Spoty in December, the little boyaposs American accent could clearly be heard as he was encouraged to say a few words for the audience.  He was also glimpsed with his face turned away from the camera in one of Meghan and Harryaposs pregnancy announcement pictures the couple shared earlier this year. In the picture announcing they were having a baby girl, Meghan stands under a tree holding Archie as Harry embraces her. Meghan this week revealed her son and husband and their special bond was the inspiration behind her first childrenaposs book, The Bench. She says the book was based on a poem she wrote for Harry on Fatheraposs Day after their son was born.Archie was born on May   at .am, weighing lb oz, and a few days after his birth his parents proudly showed him to the world, before the Queen and Prince Philip saw him for the first time.The late Duke of Edinburgh sadly missed out on marking his grandsonaposs second birthday.

Hollie Gambrel, then , was informed after eight months of inconsistent periods that she was transitioning into menopause.

Friends and family rallied round to help the couple from Texas, US, raise the ,for the IVF treatment. And they were delighted to find out that the fertilised egg had split into three - odds of one in  million. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. Kids Rory, Ryder, Rhett are now aged one and Hollie, who was a teacher, couldn’t be happier. The stay-at-home mum said: I’m speechless sometimes because I can’t believe I have three babies. I want others to know there is a way - it may not be the way you planned but it will always work out. I was heartbroken about not having my own but happy that my husband was able to have his own biological baby. The couple began saving every penny they earned to fund the costly IVF treatment. Their generous friends and family donated over , .  Hollie then selected a donor in May  who had similar characteristics to herself, such as blonde hair and being a keen runner. I felt so grateful picking a donor, she said. It was amazing to know there was someone who would give their eggs so I can try and have my own family. We were able to see the profiles and photos of dferent women who were approved by the doctoraposs office. I chose a woman who looked like me with blonde hair but she had blue eyes and I have brown. She was a similar height, athletic and a runner - like me. There were  eggs available but just one embryo was transferred in August .  She adds: On August , a blood test revealed I was pregnant. We were ecstatic as we had been waiting for this result for two years. But nothing could have prepared us for the news we received at the four-week scan. We turned bright red when they said ‘three babies’. I was in disbelief and I couldn’t stop laughing. I thought it was a joke. David was speechless. It took us a while to get our heads around but I was over the moon. Hollie was fortunate enough to work until  weeks before having a planned C-section one week later.

He had a stick and his eyes were very foggy, I’m not very informed about the specic types of blindness, but he definitely couldn’t see himself in the mirror. He was quite specic about how he wanted it done, so I asked him to feel it every so often to make sure he was happy with it so far. It was all going well and we were making good conversation.

The woman and her family had been looking for a house when they found the ideal home, complete with swimming pool, within their budget. They then discovered the reason for the discount price - a neighbouraposs child had drowned in the pool during a party, leaving the local community devastated. But the mother decided she could look past the terrible incident and the family moved in, and soon after they refilled the pool.Then, when the weather was fitting, she let her kids play in the pool - and soon received a slew of complaints from her neighbours.The mum said: So when my husband and I were looking at houses we found this great one with a pool in the backyard. Normally it would have been out of our price range, but this one was a great deal. The reason why was because one of the neighbouraposs children had drowned in the pool last summer. I know it’s really morbid, but my husband and I discussed it and we decided we could look past it. I mean we could never otherwise afford anything like it. It was big enough that all our kids could finally have their own bedrooms. When we had moved in the pool was empty and we didn’t see the point in filling it since at the time it was too cold out to go swimming anyway.  Since it’s getting hot out now we decided to finally fill it last week. Our kids had a great time swimming and were having fun laughing and playing games. Later though husband was confronted by our neighbour, the one whose kid died, saying that the sounds of kids playing in the pool was traumatising to his family and that we were horrible for letting our kids play in that pool after what happened. Since then we’ve learned from an online post that several other people in the neighbourhood similarly feel that we are being insensitive by letting out kids play in the pool. Many of them thinking that the right thing to do would have been to get rid of the pool or fill it up. Even considering it all though we don’t want to get rid of our pool. We never had a pool before, but now we’re really enjoying it and our kids do too.

Vickie, , from Benton, Tennessee, USA, decided to keep Bo in the spare room while at work the next day, in order to avoid more damage. But determined Bo chewed his way out of the wire crate and broke down the door. Vickie, who works in HR, said: “We’d only had the couch for four months when it all happened.  “Bo sleeps on the couch a lot, that is definitely his domain. He loves it.“I was at work, and I was getting alerts from my pet camera that something was happening, but I thought it was just Bo being Bo.“Never in a million years did I think he was destroying my couch.“I got home that afternoon and the dogs were greeting me at the door. I took a few steps inside and started seeing this white fluff everywhere.“Once I got to the living room, that’s when I saw the couch. My first thought was that I had been robbed and vandalised.“But then I saw the TV on the wall, and I thought, well why would they tear the couch up and leave the TV “Bo then sits down in the middle of the mess, wagging his tail. He was very happy with himself.“That’s when it all clicked. I couldn’t believe it.“It took over two hours to clean it all up, and there were six huge plastic bags full of fluff.”The next morning, Vickie kept Bo in her son’s room in a crate while she was at work to help keep him out of the way.But when she ed, he had chewed through the wire and broken down the door.She said: “I put the crate in my son’s bedroom and closed the door.“I turned on the TV with calming sounds, put on the fans, put his toys in with him. I thought he’s going to have a good day.“When I came home from work, there he was at the door. I thought ‘oh no, this cannot be good’.“There was a massive hole in my son’s door, and he had chewed his way through the crate.“I panicked because I thought he had cut his mouth to pieces, so I took him to the vet. But he was totally fine.”After visiting the vet, Bo was diagnosed with severe separation anxiety and has been put on a low dose of ‘puppy xanax’ to help keep him calm.Thankfully the pooch is doing a lot better and went viral after Vickie shared photos of the damage on social media.Vickie said: “The medicine seems to be working, I think it’s just what he needed.

Johnny Walker has had his eight-year-old Bredli carpet pythons, Jasper and Cairo, for two years. But the -year-old from Queensland, Australia says women think he’s out of his mind when he shows them pictures of the slippery pair cuddled up in bed with him. Despite suffering several nasty bites in his four years of handling snakes, Johnny says his pet pythons are like family and wants to find a woman who will accept them as part of the package. The electrical salesman said: “People are scared about coming over but I don’t know why. “Previous girlfriends would leave me instantly when they saw them and say: aposI’m not dealing with thoseapos. “Now when I show girls the pictures a lot of them think I’m out of my mind. “They slither up onto the bed and I leave them there because they like to be under the covers and warm. “When I go to bed usually one of them is already in there by himself so I’ll just get the other one and they usually just snuggle up together. “I never worry about them biting me or wrapping themselves round my neck, they just stay there all night and they love it. “They won’t have moved when I wake up in the morning.” Snake-lover Johnny has been passionate about serpents since he was six years old.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

He has suffered some nasty bites while handling over  snakes in his le, but maintains every one has been his own fault. Now Johnny has a two-storey enclosure in his living room for Jasper and Cairo, who stay in there while he goes to work, but they have a free run of the house when he gets home. He feeds the snakes a rat the size of a kitten, which keeps their appetites satisfied for ten days - but the slippery pair still make many of Johnny’s guests nervous - including his own dad who rarely comes to visit because of the free-roaming reptiles.

It came from nothing, just a little clip pass out wide.“I’d never had an injury like this before and, at the time, it didn’t feel too bad.“I wasn’t sure what I had done. It felt almost like a cramp but I thought I was fitter than that!“It was only when we scanned it a few days later and found out how bad it was. Finding out I needed surgery was a shock.“It was only when I woke up from the surgery that it all hit me, how serious it was.“But I feel a lot stronger now and I just want to get back out there.”Almost four-and-a-half months passed between his injury in the Highlands to a substitute appearance in the - win over Raith Rovers.During that time Dundee have gone from revival to no hopers and then back to revival in their quest toto the Premiership.Now, though, they have found their groove and powered up the table to finish second after eight matches unbeaten.Jakubiak may only have been able to feature in four minutes of that run – and is critical of his own showing that day, too – but is delighted to be ing to fitness with Dundee in good fettle.mdash Alex JakubiakApril , He even credits the confidence around the camp as reason for making him work even harder to get back in.The Dark Blues are now four matches away from their goal of top-flight football.They await the winner of the Raith-Dunfermline play-off quarter-final this week.And Jakubiak says there will be no letting up from the Dark Blues, eventhey have a week off ahead of the semi-final.He added: “I was speaking to some of the lads and they said they couldn’t believe how quickly the season had gone but for me it’s the complete opposite.“Just being in the gym working, watching the games and seeing the guys train, as frustrating as it is, has helped me come through stronger.“I’ve got a more positive mindset coming back to training and the way the guys have been, it’s made me work that bit harder to get up to the fitness levels needed to match the rest of the lads.“It’s been a tough season physically but mentally as well. I do feel I’ve come out of what you might say is a dark place but can now see the light at the end of the tunnel.“The mood around the club has been very positive. We know the situation we’re in.#All season we’ve been going into games believing we can win because we are a big club and need to have that mindset.“We feel we shouldn’t be in this league but that’s the situation we find ourselves in.#Now we have got into this situation we don’t want to waste all the hard work we have put in till now.“So we’re going to push even harder from now till the end of the play-offs.”Jakubiak is pushing for ato action before the end of the season but knows how much is on the line for the Dark Blues.With that in mind, he’s aware game time will not come easily with promotion at stake.But he’ll do his part when called upon.“I’ve been desperate to get back out there from day one in the gym!” he added.“That’s my mindset, I’m just eager to play and show what I can do. It’s been tough and frustrating recently not being able to play.“It was good to get a few minutes at the end of the Raith game, it felt good.#Although I am very self-critical and I know their goal was partly my fault.#Even that, regardless of my injury, I know there are parts of my game I can work on and improve on. That will only come with playing games.“I will keep working hard and I will hopefully get a chance in these games.“It will be tough, though, because the lads have been doing so well.“The performance on Friday night at Queens was pretty comfortable. We were good all over the pitch, solid at the back and Jason got his two goals. He’s in great form.“It will be tough to get into the team but all I can do is keep working.“As much as I want to play every minute, the only thing that matters is we win the ties. Our ultimate goal is promotion.“So whichever team the manager picks, he has a lot of fit, strong, lads who are ready to go. Whoever he picks will do a good job.# Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion # and he says the Dark Blues are a better side than his Livingston play-off winners\" title\"#Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion # and he says the Dark Blues are a better side than his Livingston play-off winners# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp shaun-byrne-is-determined-to-relive-the-best-moment-of-his-career-by-helping-dundee-to-promotion-and-he-says-the-dark-blues-are-a-better-side-than-his-livingston-play-off-winners embed # secretFUAHaUB\" data-secret\"FUAHaUB\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/20108954-620x351.jpg ","title":"play offs who do dundee want to face in the semi final dunfermline or raith","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAll Championship eyes will be on East End Park this weekend where Raith Rovers host Dunfermline in the second leg of their crucial play-off clash.Who makes it all the way to the final, we’ll all have to wait and see. The tie remains on a kne-edge after a - draw at East End Park in the first leg.However, one team who knows they are at least in the semi-final is Dundee – and they’ll most certainly be keeping a keen eye on events at the weekend.The Dark Blues grabbed second place at the final hurdle last Friday and now await the winner of the Pars and Rovers next week.Dens boss James McPake will be an interested onlooker at Stark#s Park but who will he want to be facing next week Dundee and Raith have shared the spoils in meetings this season with Rovers just edging an aggregate score by one goal.A win apiece after a draw in the opening fixture doesn’t give clear indication yet about who would be favourite in a potential two-legged tie.In fact, taking the last two as such, the Kirkcaldy side would head through to the final -.The Dark Blues were still a little fragile after their opening day - defeat to Hearts and that proved the case late on against recently-promoted Raith.Charlie Adam had netted his first goal at Dens Park from the edge of the area and Dundee looked to be heading for three points.However, poor defending from a corner allowed Frankie Musonda to head in an equaliser on  minutes.At that point, Raith were flying out of the traps on theirto the Championship, having scored eight in their opening two games and beating Arbroath and Queen of the South.They would then fire five past Morton the following week.This was a low point in the season for the Dark Blues and a high one for John McGlynn’s Rovers. They were deserving winners against a poor Dundee and rose to second place for the first time in the season.The Dark Blues had mitigating factors of missing central defenders with teenage pairing Malachi Fagan-Walcott and Sam Fisher thrown in at the deep end.However, it was a disheartening defeat for McPake and his side as they failed to build on their big win over Hearts at the turn of the year.The most recent meeting of the pair and therefore most relevant.On the back of a good run of form, Dundee knew only victory would dothey were to pip Raith to second.And they came away with a deserving win at Dens Park.Critically they nullied the threat from their opponents, denying Raith the chance to get possession in areas that have caused so much damage to teams this season.mdash Dundee Football ClubApril , And they made the most of their chances at the other end, too. A good move earned a penalty, slotted home by Jason Cummings before Liam Fontaine headed in a second.Rovers would come back into it late on with a Kyle Benedictus goal but it was Dundee’s day.Against Dunfermline it makes better reading for Dundee – a win and two draws, though the Dark Blues can argue they should have had at least two wins.Using the same logic as before – taking the last two clashes into account, the Dark Blues head through in a two-legged tie -.For much of this game it looked like the Dark Blues had finally found their feet this season only to throw it all away.Strolling to victory with  minutes to go, the wheels came flying off as the Pars roared back from - down to draw with the final kick of the game.At that point, Dunfermline’s form had cooled off after a sizzling start to the campaign but Dundee were unable to add to their worries.Another goal-laden clash with a big comeback at Dens Park came just a few weeks ago.Poor defending from the hosts gave the Pars a two-goal lead within six minutes.This time it was the Dark Blues storming back, goals from Cummings, Lee Ashcroft and Danny Mullen earned three points.A night to forget for most who watched it at East End Park. The two sides showed promise in attack, Dundee more so, but neither had the finishing touch to earn victory.DWWLLRaith’s form going into the play-offs is decent enough, two defeats in eight.However, the last two could be the most telling – confidence-shredding defeats to Dundee and Hearts.If the loss at Dens was a kick in the guts, the Jambos were aiming a bit lower last weekend.Lucky to get away with just a - scoreline against the champions, Raith put on a show of how not to play out from the back.Tonight will be a test of their character after that.DDWWLThe Pars took a - tanking from their rivals not so long ago but went five unbeaten before losing to Alloa last time out.That clash against the already-relegated Wasps won’t tell us much, though, with Stevie Crawford’s mind already looking ahead to the play-offs.That was shown with a changed line-up and early subs for key players Ewan Murray, Declan McManus and Ewan Henderson.Regan HendryThe midfield man makes Rovers tick in the middle of the park with much of their good attacking play going through him.Lewis VaughanMajor injuries have blighted the attacker’s career but the talent he possesses has never been in doubt.Gozie UgwuRaith’s most in-form goalscorer has three in his last seven.Craig WightonThe former Dundee favourite moved onto nine Championship goals this season with two against Arbroath last time out.He has netted six times since leaving Hearts in January and has found his best Pars form in recent weeks.Declan McManusDunfermline’s top scorer this season has already netted four times against Raith and Dundee respectively this term.He also has nine in the league, including two in his last five appearances.Kevin O’HaraThe livewire forward has made a real impact since moving from Alloa last summer and finished the regular season with eight goals.He has two in his last three.Almost all of Dundee’s clashes against Raith and Dunfermline have ended up in tight scorelines.And don’t expect any play-off meeting to be any dferent.The question of who the Dark Blues would rather face comes down to a preference of form over style – or vice versa.Dunfermline are in better form than Raith, no question. And the Kirkcaldy side have worries to contend with at the back with the loss of Musonda.His pace and ability on the ball allowed them to play their game – high defensive line and passing out from the back.They haven’t coped so well without him in big games recently.The Pars, meanwhile, had lost their way not so long ago but seem to have found a bit of momentum.Goals are coming from Wighton, McManus and O’Hara and they’ve kept both Dundee and Hearts out in recent weeks.Form suggests a preference to face Raith next week, particularly after another two bruising encounters.However, Dundee haven’t lost to Dunfermline this season and the Pars haven’t won a league game at Dens Park for  years.The record books say the Pars are a better bet for the Dee.The fact Dundee are able to sit out this stage while their coming opponents battles through two tough play-off games leaves them as favourites next week.And that may be the best outcome for McPake and his Dark Blues # sitting back while Raith and Dunfermline play out a punishing two-leg tie that goes the distance, leaving the winner out on their feet before the semi-final. John McGlynn insists there#s no pressure on Raith Rovers following Premiership playoff stalemate with Dunfermline\" title\"#John McGlynn insists there#s no pressure on Raith Rovers following Premiership playoff stalemate with Dunfermline# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football scottish-championship  john-mcglynn-insists-theres-no-pressure-on-raith-rovers-following-premiership-playoff-stalemate-with-dunfermline embed # secretELFyTJUe\" data-secret\"ELFyTJUe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-boy-greenock-blitz---harrys-memories-night-town-bombed","story":"EIGHT-year-old Harry Edwards could see the flames and hear the explosions from  miles away."},{"url":null,"title":"scotswoman-year-looking-back-landmark-event-prepare-announce-2020-winner","story":"ldquoIT IS a new and important landmark in the feminine le of Scotlandhellip"},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-four-glasgow-teachers-conquered-mighty-whirlpool-scottish-first","story":"WHEN keen kayakers Jim, Angus, Bill and Peter found themselves storm-bound on an island off the west coast in , they dreamt up a history-making plan."},{"url":null,"title":"high-street-future-glasgow-building-already-focus-planners","story":"COUNCIL planners were already assessing whether High Street buildings ndash close to yesterdayrsquos fire ndash could be demolished."},{"url":null,"title":"opening-date-glasgow-forts-new-five-guys-confirmed","story":"BURGER fans rejoice!

incident management teambeing launched to bring the virus back under control.There are now has . cases per , area, meaning it is the worst in Scotland.East Dunbartonshire has the second highest with

Elgin Academy and will be in operation from Friday morning.The school has been at the epicentre of the Covid outbreak, with  cases linked to there.Parents had previously been advised that the unit would arrive next week, but with a rapidly rising number of cases, the IMT made a decision to expedite the process.The unit will provide PCR testing for staff and pupils on school days and be open to the public during the weekend.These MTUs will also be visiting towns and villages around Moray in the coming days, with details on dates and times being published shortly online.Amid the increases the opening hours at the UK Government-run testing site at Lossie Green in Elgin have been reduced from am to pm previously to am to .pm now.The facility now closes early before reopening at .pm, following a deep clean, to distribute home test kits.A Department for Health spokesman said: #Testing remains a vital part of the response to Covid- as we cautiously ease lockdown restrictions, which is why we have rolled out free regular, rapid testing for people without symptoms, meaning cases can be detected faster and more easily, and outbreaks can be stopped earlier.#Chris Littlejohn, deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian and chairman for the IMT, revealed towns such as Lossiemouth, Keith and Buckie were also recording rising Covid levels.He said: “In Moray, we are now seeing uncontrolled, sustained community transmission, current restrictions not are containing it, and the situation is rapidly deteriorating.#We are seeing hospitalisations from this – including in the under s – and we will see deathsthe situation is not brought under control.“We are urging everyone to #ProtectMoray and get tested, eventhey have no symptoms.#We hope that by intervening further now we can avoid the possibility of further restrictions or a continuation of level three in Moray – but we need to act now and we need the people of Moray to act with us.“Although Elgin is the epicentre of the spread, we are now seeing rising levels in places including Lossiemouth, Buckie and Keith.“We are writing to businesses encouraging them to support us in getting the workforce tested, we are deploying extra mobile testing units and we are continuing with our enhanced testing in the region.#Door-to-door Covid testing in Elgin is being considered by the IMT, with discussions ongoing about what this would look like.In England, this was done back in February to stamp out the South African iant that was flown into the country.It was undertaken in eight areas of England where the  cases were discovered, which including Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire.Moray MP Douglas Ross said: #The fact that door-to-door testing is being considered should act as a stark reminder to everybody just how severe this has become.#I am not aware of that having happened anywhere  in Scotland during this pandemic.“The advice is clear. Get tested, andyou do test positive, you must self-isolate.#Community testing is widely available, and the health board is encouraging people to get tested whether they have symptoms or not.#Many people will not display symptoms and could be spreading the disease without knowing it.#Since April , there have been  cases in Moray, with more than half of those coming in the last eight days alone.This has been described by health chiefs as a #rapidly accelerating situation.#Test positivity in the region is at .% # across Scotland, that figure is close to just %.The R-rate is at ., which means that every person in Moray that becomes infected, is on average, passing it to two other people.Mr Littlejohn added: “Analytics have shown us many people in the region have ed to their workplaces, rather than working from home.#It remains the advice people should work from home where possible and we really need people to do that, where they can.”NHS Grampian is asking anyone in Moray with any symptoms of illness, not just those with Covid-, to isolate and book a test immediately.People without symptoms are continuing to be asked to take up asymptomatic testing.For the latest information on testing in Moray or to book a test visit here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/6093f32b07e9d2.52144545.jpg ","title":"our aberdeen gardening scenes always evergreen","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAs the weather gradually improves, many of us will be thinking of exercising our green fingers once again and getting active in the garden.Gardening has increased in popularity during the pandemic and can be very beneficial for physical and mental health.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Excess deaths are the dference between the total recorded deaths by all causes and the average of the previous five years. The chart below shows this for the UK constituent countries.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyll gardens bloom for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves # like so many other families # caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons # Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action  and John, , missing in action  # during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimagineable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#[Note: Would you set the following as a piece within the overall feature please]It was while talking with a cousin about the family#s McNab heritage that Clare learned of a th century tragedy in the family.Her cousin mentioned a drowning on Loch Awe involving Donald McNab, elder brother by four years of Alexander.Parliamentary records reveal that Donald, a boatman, drowned on the morning of June  .Hansard records that Sir Charles Cameron, Liberal MP for Glasgow College, asked the Lord Advocate Mr J H A MacDonald about the incident in the House of Commons during September that year.He pointed out that Donald#s body was not found where his companions in the boat alleged he had fallen overboard and, when found floating weeks afterwards, it bore marks on the head and hand.Given those circumstances and #considering the anxiety of McNab#s family to have the case investigated#, he asked the Lord Advocate whether he would direct the procurator fiscal #to order such post mortem examination as may show whether the marks referred to had been caused before or after death or,such an examination has been made, he will allow MacNab#s family to inspect the medical report and any depositions in the case #The Lord Advocate replied that the people who were with him in the boat gave information at once to the police.He added: #The body was not recovered until August  and was, of course, in an advanced state of decomposition and had been injured from being in that state.#It was examined by a competent medical man who reported there was no sign of any injury having been inflicted before death. It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This has allowed us to concentrate on a purely on-the-water racing event which reduces contact possibilities. It is also important we reduce the movement of crew as much as possible.#By moving the event to the Clyde, we have taken a massive step towards achieving this goal, however, it is clear we need to take measures a bit further.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Of course, this has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a very dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for wildle.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Mountain bikingHire a mountain bike at one of Scotlandrsquos many trail centres and ride routes that are graded green for beginners, through blue, red and black for the most experienced. There are also orange grades for the most technical downhill sections.Visit trail centres such as Glentress near Peebles Laggan Wolftrax near Newtonmore and Comrie Croft in Perthshire, where there are routes for all ages and aspirations.. Canadian canoeingThere are numerous rivers and lochs in Scotland that are ideal for a two-person paddle in an open-top Canadian canoe.To start with, choose a calm day and a waterway that is not choppy.

I have served as the MSP for the constituency since , following a by-election, gaining . per cent of the vote and a , majority.At every turn, I have stood up and fought for my constituents. Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge. Moreover, I have urged the Scottish Government to provide free dyslexia tests for adults to improve social mobility  opportunities.I continue to strongly oppose a second independence referendum and believe we can build back better with the strength of the United Kingdom.Barbra Harvie Barbra Harvie, Scottish GreensThe Scottish Green Party candidate for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Barbra Harvie, is a semi-retired lecturer in Ecology, Environment and Countryside who lives in Selkirk.She says: \"Our isolated rural communities and small urban environments in South of Scotland have come together with resilience, determination and care to tackle the enormous challenge of COVID- but we are also facing a global climate emergency that can no longer be ignored.\"Scotland needs a Green recovery from the global pandemic that also confronts the global climate emergency.

Before politics I worked in the third sector as a fundraising assistant for Marie Curie, and then for international oil company National Oilwell Varco Mission Products handling customs and logistics. I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position.

Paul, who is a former Corsquopath and then Ayton community councillor, can trace his roots to the th Century in Bonchester. He was born near Belfast in  and moved to Scotland as a three-year-old. He was educated in Edinburgh before studying for his honours degree in Economics at University of Aberdeen, before embarking on a -year career as a professional economist. In , Paul graduated with a Masters in Business Administrationfrom University of Edinburgh. A keen rugby player at school, Paul is a fan of both rugby and football, and has a keen interest in local history and genealogy. Paul has one son.Paul has served as a South Scotland MSP since . In the last five years alone, Paul and his team have helped or supported more than , constituents from his office in Hawick. Paul is an experienced parliamentarian and minister, having led seven Acts through Parliament ndash most recently legislating on Heat networks. Indeed, after serving for a year on the Parliamentrsquos Finance Committee and Standards Committee, Paul was appointed within the Scottish Government in , as Minister for Environment and Climate Change, in which role he served until November . In Nicola Sturgeonrsquos first ministerial team following her appointment, Paul was appointed Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs and, following, the  election, became Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy. In June , Paulrsquos portfolio was modied retaining Energy and taking over digital infrastructure investment in broadband and mobile, as well as the Islands portfolio, as Minister for Energy, Connectivity  the Islands. Since , he has led the Scottish Governmentrsquos Energy Strategy and the transition of Scotlandrsquos energy system, delivering the equivalent of some  per cent of Scotlandrsquos electricity demand in  from renewable electricity sources.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite. But theyrsquore effective, labour-intensive, local, and fair.This election is our chance to tackle the climate emergency, to build a green recovery, and to secure our future as an independent European country. Please vote like our future depends on it. Vote Scottish Greens.Michael Banks Michael Banks is a retired barrister and Vanguard Partys candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale  Lauderdale, and heads the partys list for South Scotland. He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

We havenrsquot seen anything like that to date, and the question yoursquore asking is the million dollar question in many ways, everybody wants to know whatrsquos the likelihood and when is it likely to occur,at all.ldquoWhat we donrsquot know isit is likely to occur. We know that as mutations accumulate in the virus, it can actually make it more fit in terms of avoiding our immune system, but the more mutations it accumulates, it could actually lead to a virus that is less infectious, for example.vw,vw,px, px\"Scientists say that none of the known Covid iants can fully evade current vaccines ldquoSo therersquos a trade-off for the virus in terms of how many mutations it can tolerate.ldquoNow, some people have predicted that a virus could emerge that is pretty resistant to vaccines, but we havenrsquot seen any hint of that at the moment.ldquoAnd the idea that this could arise is based on models from previous viruses, not this current one, so at the moment, I remain optimistic that wersquore in a good place ndash that the viruses that are circulating are susceptible to vaccinations.ldquoAnd the key thing is to get on and vaccinate the world so that we can clamp down [on] disease. If we can reduce disease rates, then we reduce the risk of iants arising in the first place.Prof Peacock said work was ongoing to look at the iant first identied in India, including whether it could spread in the UK compared to the Kent iant.The Indian government has said the coronavirus iant first discovered there in March may be linked to its deadly second wave.Samples for the B.. iant have been found in several states with high case numbers, it said.The National Centre for Disease Control said, however, that it had still been unable to fully establish a correlation.Asked about the iant, which has been found in a small number of cases in the UK and is currently regarded as a iant under investigation, Prof Peacock said: ldquoMy eyes are constantly now looking at the pattern of spread within the United Kingdom to see whether this iant is able to spread in our population under current restrictions.ldquoTherersquos no evidence at the moment that the iant described in India, which we call B.., is resistant to the vaccine, far more work needs to be done.ldquoVery early work suggests that itrsquos not as resistant as, say, the iant first described in South Africa.ldquoBut what we donrsquot know about this particular iant from India is how transmissible it is, so thatrsquos the other key question.ldquoThe big question for me, is whether the Indian iant is also particularly transmissible.ldquoNow we can see that through experimental work, but the key is to watch it in the population, to see whether itrsquos associated with outbreaks and spread in the community.ldquoI know that Public Health England are really looking very carefully at that because thatrsquos a sign that under the circumstances wersquore under in terms of our current restrictions, whether that is spreading is a key signal ndash a public health signal of transmissibility.ldquoWersquod obviously have to prove that scientically, but thatrsquos a really key thing to watch out for.vw,vw,px, px\"Prof Peacock suggested richer nations should be doing all they can to help vaccinate people in poorer countries.She said: ldquoWe in wealthy countries should be thinking about people who are less fortunate than ourselves, and added: ldquoWe should be vaccinating the world on a moral standpoint, but also vaccinating the world to try and reduce the rate of infection, so that we protect people from an untimely death, but also reduce the risk of iants emerging in the first place, because ultimately in the long-term, that is one of the major threats to us controlling this pandemic.Asked whether Covid will become like annual seasonal flu, she said: ldquoThe idea that the virus will become like a common cold and nobody will notice it by next spring is far too optimistic.ldquoAnd so it could take one or two generations before we see a virus that starts to, what we say attenuate, which means it causes less severe disease, and so, I think, what we have to do is tackle the problem thatrsquos in front of us at the moment and not put too much store in the fact that the virus is going to evolve into something thatrsquos really rather harmless.ldquoThatrsquos been seen for other

the Jersey government to carry on operating.Local fishermen reported flares were let off and that some boats entered the harbour for around an hour, with footage posted online apparently showing a

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 23 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are lots of brilliant causes worth supporting butever there was one the whole community could get behind, it is surely this.Let#s make play inclusive in Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"letters april 23 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals.

Community benefit and shared ownership must, they say, be made a requirement of all future wind farm projects.They also believe residents are at a disadvantage when dealing with complex, jargon-filled planning proposals, and called for the Scottish Government to enforce better community engagement and provide funding towards professional advice for community councils affected by larger developments falling under section  and  of of the Electricity Act .The government must explore alternative arrangements, added the group, for the re-opening of the Machrihanish wind turbine factory.The height and number of turbines is of increasing concern, with recent applications proposing towers up to  metres high # some  per cent taller than many existing structures.The group believes the cumulative effect will negatively impact the area#s scenic beauty and therefore tourism.Bob Chicken, planning convenor for Tarbert and Skipness Community Council, said: #Our communities# needs are being ignored. We believe that our proposals will strike a fairer balance between the need for greener power and the needs of the remote and rural populations who live and work in the lands used to generate it.#The group#s specic concerns were put to renewable energy industry body Scottish Renewables.Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, replied by saying that rural Scotland had a #central role# to play in delivering clean power for climate change targets.She continued: #The latest UK Government figures show that only  per cent of Scots are opposed to the development of onshore wind farms. That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#Renewables now provide the equivalent of  per cent of Scotland’s electricity consumption, with onshore wind delivering the bulk of that power, employing , people across the country and supporting a thriving supply chain of businesses from the central belt to the Borders, Highlands and Islands.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sun shines for delayed but welcomed opening of bowling greens","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Still unable to control his weeping, he began to crawl backwards. Izzy opened the door and cradled him as he crumpled onto the floor in the corridor outside the room.Izzy glanced quickly inside, checking Finn was still asleep. He moved for a moment, then turned over. She slowly and carefully closed the door and sat down with Ewen, putting her arms around him.She had no words, but knew words were not what was needed. She just held him in a hug as he wept his soul out.A fellow guest walked by on the way to the showers. He paused for a moment with a towel hanging over his right shoulder.ldquoYou all right  he asked.ldquoMy friend has just had some bad news, said Izzy.ldquoOK, yeah, I can see that, hope it works out, he said awkwardly and headed for the showers.Finally, Ewen began to compose himself and appeared from behind his hands, his face a sodden mess. Izzy took her arms away, gave him a sympathetic look and stood up.ldquoLetrsquos find a place we can sit and talk, she said.Ewen nodded and pulled himself up off the floor with Izzyrsquos help.

Ewen sat at a table and Izzy put the kettle on.Then she came and sat next to him, putting a supportive hand on his left arm. They both sat, not speaking. Ewen finally stopped crying and Izzy got up and brought some paper kitchen towels so he could wipe his face, then went to make tea for them both. She ed with two steaming mugs and sat by him again, still not speaking, just being there for him, her best friend.He stared at the mug of tea, lted it to his lips, then spoke before he drank.ldquoI hardly recognised him, he said.He took a gulp of tea and looked up at Izzy.His voice began to break as he tried to explain: ldquoItrsquos been four years since I saw him ndash last time was just before his eighth birthday. Hersquos changed so much. But then I heard his breathing as he slept, thatrsquos the same, I recognised that.He drank some more tea, took in a deep breath, then exhaled loudly with a sigh.ldquoHe used to fall asleep after Irsquod told him a story and I would stay for a while and listen to him breathe.He could feel tears welling up again. ldquoSorry Izzy, I canrsquot help it, so embarrassing.Tears streamed down his cheeks again and he lowered his head.Izzy walked to the sink, tore some more kitchen towels from the rack and gave them to him. She sat by him.ldquoI canrsquot imagine what it feels like, Ewen, all those years of pent-up emotion missing your son, there is no need to apologise. I should have realised how hard that would be for you. It was my mistake.Ewen looked up. ldquoGod no, Izzy, thanks to you Irsquove seen Finn, close up, in the moonlight and sleeping. I was able to whisper to him under my breath that I loved him, just before I lost it and made that scene.Izzy looked round the empty kitchen.ldquoI think everyone in here thinks wersquore a couple whorsquove fallen out, she said. ldquoIrsquom a bit concerned that people will talk about it tomorrow morning and Finn could overhear. I think, to be on the safe side, we will leave as soon as possible and have breakfast by the loch.

Irsquoll cook something by the loch later.He opened the packet, then scrunched the crisps into small bits.

It was just one of the things we used to do. I dunno how we started it.

Izzy wasnrsquot sureshe was making things worse or better for him by telling him such things.ldquoDoes he like his boots  he asked.ldquoLoves them and they fit perfectly.Ewen nodded, then clenched his hands together on the table. Izzy could feel his pain. She placed her hands on top of his.ldquoEwen, you are doing amazing, this must be hell for you, I know how much you love Finn and want him to know it.

Hersquos been through enough already.ldquoI will, I promise.Ewen finished his tea and left the hostel.Izzy sat a while, trying to calm herself, eyes closed and breathing deeply.ldquoYou all right, honey She opened her eyes: it was a woman who had come into the kitchen. Izzy wanted to say yes but the womanrsquos concern and kind words triggered a flood of tears. It was her turn to be comforted, by a stranger who knew nothing of the burden she carried, of her guilt and overwhelming feeling of responsibility.ldquoThank you for being so kind, she said to the woman. ldquoI feel much better now after a wee greet.ldquoNo man is worth such upset, my lovely, the kind woman said. Izzy just nodded and smiled at her. If only it was that simple, she thought.She ed to the room and opened the door slowly Finn was sound asleep. Izzy felt emotionally exhausted and hoped shersquod fall asleep quickly, but as she lay in her bed after a hot shower, she couldnrsquot stop her mind racing it had been so close, whatFinn had woken  She trusted Ewen to be careful. But she must be careful too. Finally, under the gaze of MacFarlanersquos Lantern, sleep overtook her.Finn was first to wake in the morning.ldquoAunty, aunty, itrsquos morning! he said while looking out of the window. It was daylight but the sky had clouded over and thick mist hung on the hills.ldquoA typical Highland morning, he said cheerfully.Izzy got things packed as Finn had his shower and they left the hostel before most of the other residents were out of their beds. After a phone call to Finnrsquos mum, they set off.ldquoWhere we having breakfast  asked Finn.ldquoVery close by, on the banks of Loch Dochart.They drove for just a few minutes and pulled into a layby. Izzy performed her usual routine of bringing her rucksack. They walked through some woodland and arrived at the waterrsquos edge.ldquoWow, is that an island with a castle on it  asked Finn.ldquoIt is, said Izzy, ldquoand what stories are here! Irsquoll tell you some over breakfast.Finn helped Izzy set up her stove and they took turns stirring the porridge. There were midges in the air, at times annoying, but it was late in the season and their biting was minimal. A breeze from the loch kept them away most of the time.She told Finn of the castlersquos history, how the island was once a MacGregor stronghold, but that lsquoBlack Duncan Campbellrsquo built the castle they saw now after he took the land.Then Izzy told an ancient legend: ldquoIt was here that Fionn MacCoul met his death, at the hands of a giant named Taileachd.Finn scooped more porridge into his bowl but he nodded, showing he was listening and wanted Izzy to continue.ldquoThe giant lived with his sweetheart, who was a beautul faery maiden.ldquoOf course, said Finn, smiling cheekily.Izzy ed the smile and continued: ldquoSome versions of the tale say they had their home on an island on Loch Lubhair, just downstream, while others an island here on Loch Dochart, maybe even that one.Finn studied the castlersquos ruins, which peered out from the trees which covered the island. It looked so mysterious.ldquoOne day, Taileachd discovered that his sweetheart had met Fionn and they had fallen in love.ldquoSo Fionn ran off with her, thatrsquos ironic! laughed Finn.ldquoNo, you see she loved them both, maybe in dferent ways, but she was now torn between them. They were going to fight over her, and she knew one of them would be killed, so she came up with an idea.Finn put his bowl down and listened as Izzy acted out the tale.ldquolsquoPlease put your anger awayrsquo, said the faery woman. lsquoI love you both, but whoever can leap the furthest I shall be with.rsquoldquoA jumping competition! exclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly!Izzy dramatically described how the two competitors leapt from the island trying to outperform each other. They were equally matched but when they jumped backwards, Fionn momentarily lost his balance and the giant, fearful he was going to lose his sweetheart, took the opportunity to cut off Fionnrsquos head!ldquoAw, ouch, foul! cried Finn.Izzy nodded and spoke with a solemn tone.ldquoIn that moment of violence, they all lost everything. The faery woman fled: she no longer loved Taileachd because of his brutal act, and Fionn, whom she loved, had lost his le. His body floated down the river, and was found by the Fiann, his band of warriors. They buried him at Killin and now they were full of vengeance, so went to search for Fionnrsquos murderer.ldquoDid they find him ldquoWell, Taileachd fled to Rannoch Moor and Irsquoll tell you what happened when we get there, later today.ldquoAw, aunty!Finnrsquos protest was interrupted as his attention was suddenly caught by the sight of a man in a dinghy rowing out into the loch. They watched as he struggled a bit in the current, then vanished behind the eastern side of the island. A few minutes later, the man appeared on top of the ruined tower, half hidden by branches. He sat there.Finn waved and the man waved back.ldquoI really want to go onto that island and see the castle and where the giant lived. Maybe that man will lend us his dingy ldquoHersquos probably going fishing, Finn, and is just looking at the water to see where the fish are. Hersquoll be there all day.ldquoWe could swim ldquoThe current is too strong here Finn, but we could swim at out next stop: St Fillanrsquos healing pool, itrsquos part of the river, just upstream from here.Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge looking out to the island, disappointed. But he accepted his auntrsquos decision.They packed up and headed for the healing pool.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

it is hoped the reduced congestion will provide greater reliability of services.The council spokeswoman previously explained that congestion could happen on Musselburgh High Street when one bus had to

With performance in mind, it combined a .-litre petrol engine with a supercharger, resulting in a lot more power than the standard version. It had a more focused suspension set-up too, while the bonnet air intake became a design feature for all future Cooper S models.Production ramps upIncredibly, by May  ndash just over a year since it went on sale ndash the ,th Mini was produced at BMW Groups Oxford plant. It was a testament to the success of the design and execution of the Mini, thats for sure.The Mini goes drop-topFlash forward to  and the Mini Convertible arrived, bringing that wind-in-your-hair experience to the already-popular model. It still retained space for four, but used a fabric roof that folds up behind the rear seats and didnt require a cover.The boot may have been small at  litres with the roof open, but as with the rest of the range, the Convertible sold like hotcakes.Arrival of the GPThings took a turn for the more serious, with the arrival of the GP in . Limited to just , models worldwide ndash with  made available to UK buyers ndash the lighter, faster and meaner GP sold out before a single customer had even driven a car.Arriving as the most powerful production Mini to date, it used the same .-litre supercharged petrol engine as the Cooper S, but it was boosted for more power while plenty of weight was stripped from the cabin to make the GP even more exciting to drive.The dficult second albumIn August , Mini chose to reveal its second-generation car. It retained the same retro look like the original but was bigger and more efficient than before. The .-litre engine was changed, while the Cooper S used turbocharging instead of supercharging for the first time. Prices increased, too, with the One starting from pound, and the Cooper commanding pound,.Here comes the ClubmanMini took its first step in expanding the range with the introduction of the Clubman in . Debuting a new, estate car-like layout, the Clubman offered more space than the conventional hatch but retained the standard cars nimble handling and punchy range of engines.The start of electricationAt the  Los Angeles Auto Show, Mini presented the E, an electric concept. It created  Mini E vehicles, which were shipped for testing by private customers in Calornia, New York and New Jersey, with the results from this trial relayed back to Mini. It also helped BMW to develop its electric i model.The Countryman hits the roadNot content with the Clubman, Mini expanded the range in  with the Countryman. Taking advantage of the growing appetite for SUVs, the Countryman effectively took the Mini recipe and raised it further off the ground.It had seating for five, four doors and a reasonably large boot. It also retained the same funky styling that you got from the standard hatch.The Roadster and Coupe add even more styleMoving along to  saw the introduction of the Mini Coupe, a two-seater version of the standard hatch which was famously styled to resemble a backwards-facing baseball cap. It was joined by a soft-top version ndash the Roadster. It used a fabric roof like the standard convertible, but had a sleeker, more aerodynamically focused design.A change of pace for MiniIn , Mini introduced the Paceman, which represented a mash-up of an SUV and hatchback. In truth, it was a slightly odd combination, as it had an upright body style but just three doors. Sitting alongside the rest of the Mini line-up, it saw the firms range of cars swell to seven.Third times the charmShortly after the introduction of the Paceman came the introduction of a third-generation hatch. It debuted a new interpretation of the cars classic styling, but was still built in Oxford and was centred around that fun-to-drive experience. Arriving in , the third-generation hatch was bigger in every sense and utilised .-litre three-cylinder engines ndash though the more powerful Cooper S benefitted from a four-cylinder, .-litre petrol.The Mini gains a set of doorsShortly after the arrival of the third-generation Mini came a new, five-door iant, which brought improved rear legroom, a third rear seat, and a more accessible cabin. It has continued to be a great option even today.The Clubman ndash betteredMini followed on from the revitalisation of its hatchback with the introduction of a revised Clubman. It was bigger than before but retained the useful split rear doors, which gave access to a larger boot than before.An electried CountrymanIn , Mini showcased a real attempt at electrication with its Countryman Plug-in hybrid. The first hybrid model to be offered by the brand, it combined a three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor and batteries. Capable of driving for up to  miles on battery-power alone, it was easily the most economical car in Minis stable.The Mini goes electricThe year  proved to be a big deal for Mini, as it was when the companys first EV arrived in showrooms ndash the Mini Electric. Its styling was largely unchanged over the regular petrol and diesel models, while a zippy electric motor ensured it delivered the same winning driving experience. The Mini Electric has gone on to prove popular, despite its relatively short range of  miles.The present dayIn January , Mini presented the latest incarnation of its famous hatchback, delivering a new look and a range of technology updates. Though the styling was classical Mini, some key refinements ndash such as a new body-coloured front grille ndash ensure that it has remained looking sharp and up to date."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-squirrel-proof-bird-feeders-actually-work","story":"Gardening: Do squirrel-proof bird feeders actually work A squirrel feederI have long had a problem with grey squirrels. They feast on birdseed in trays, play acrobatics to jump on fat ball feeders and make light work of scaling metal poles to steal the peanuts from my bird feeders.So, is there really a squirrel-proof feeder which works Matthew Tume, RSPB product manager of birdcare and optics, says that in reality, no product on the market is totally squirrel-proof.\"Squirrels are very intelligent and very determined, and they will find ways around things.\"However, Rachel Schofield, of birdfood and wildle product specialist CJ Wildle, says: \"Theres a great number of really good squirrel-proof feeders on the market, as far as adult squirrels are concerned. Juveniles, however, can squeeze through protective cages.\"What material should you go for \"Metal and preferably powder-coated. Plastic feeders wont last very long. You can buy protective cages for many feeders, but its cheaper to buy an integrated unit,\" says Schofield.\"Squirrels can chew through plastic ports, so we would recommend you use metal feeders, rather than plastic ones,\" Tume agrees.What about birdseed Youre best off with a no waste seed mix, says Schofield, which will help deter pigeons and squirrels from picking up the discarded husks which smaller birds deposit on to the ground. You can buy huskless seeds and sunflower hearts.\"De-husked ieties will be more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Reputable companies which sell good quality seed mixes wont pack them full of wheat or maize. And using de-husked ieties means that birds dont lose time trying to get to the nutrients,\" says Schofield.Where should I put the feeders \"Set them away from jumping-off points, such as fences and hanging trees. However, there is a balance. You want your feeders to have a degree of cover, as the further out in the open they are, the easier it is for predators - such as birds of prey - to spot them,\" says Tume.Are there any other ways to deter squirrels Some people suggest dusting the birdseed with chilli powder or hot sauce like Tabasco, which apparently doesnt bother the birds, but the squirrels dont like the spice, says Tume.Others recommend smearing your bird feeder poles with Vaseline to stop the squirrels climbing up them.Or, you could always try putting up a squirrel feeder at the other end of the garden, away from your bird station, and give visiting squirrels some peanuts of their own.On test: Which squirrel deterrents should I consider Feeder s\"There are feeder s, which are effectively cages which go around your feeders. You hang your feeders inside the cage. The idea is that the cage holes are big enough for small birds to enter and exit safely, and small enough to act as a deterrent for squirrels. They make it more dficult for squirrels to access, but juveniles will be able to squeeze through,\" says Tume.\"Smaller birds - such as blue tits, goldfinches and greenfinches - will be able to fly in and out of the cages, but larger birds - such as jackdaws and magpies - may be deterred, although magpies have long necks, so may be able to reach through to get the seed, depending on the gap between the cage wall and the feeder.\"They should be made to the exact specication which allows small birds in safely, but also deters adult squirrels and large birds,\" he adds.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel  Port Adventurer withThis was the only item which really stopped the squirrel in its tracks. It managed to jump on to the top of the feeder from a tall shrub but was too big to get through the metal guard. It even tried to open the lid of the tubular feeder, but couldnt get in.Squirrel bafflesThese are plastic domes which fit either over the bird feeder, or half way up the poleyou are securing the feeder from the ground, but under the feeding stations. They aim to prevent squirrels from descending on to or climbing up to the feeders.\"If they manage to climb on to the baffle, the baffle often rocks the squirrels loose, so they fall off,\" says Tume. \"We get mixed feedback on them.\"Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Guard Baffle This cone did stop the squirrels from climbing up to reach the feeder, but one managed to get on to the feeder from above, and then accessed the food. However, once Id moved the pole away from tall shrubs and trees from which it could gain access, the baffle worked very well.The weighted feederSquirrel Buster feeders are weighted devices which shut off access to the feeding points when a squirrel or heavy pigeon lands on them, via a metal shutter. These are widely available and one of the most popular deterrents.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Buster Peanut Birdfeeder I made the mistake of hanging this weighted feeder from a bracket on my garden fencepost, which enabled the squirrel to access the peanuts by taking its weight on its back legs on the fence and then gently placing its front paws on the feeder.It didnt manage to get much food though, as the feeder bobbed up and down as its weight distribution changed. Place the feeder in a clear space with no other balancing points nearby, and it will be much more effective."},{"url":null,"title":"hannah-simone-for-sake-comedy-pit-women-other","story":"Overflowing with charmingly relatable, and, at times, utterly bizarre story arcs, US sitcom New Girl was quick to capture the hearts of viewers on both sides of the Atlantic.It is, in essence, the ultimate embodiment of le during your late s and early s.Encapsulating the day-to-day escapades of four equally quirky characters living under one roof, the show quickly achieved cult status, running for a grand total of  episodes before finally drawing to an end in .Now, as the show prepares to mark its th anniversary, Disney has announced that New Girl will be available to a whole new audience when it arrives on Star on the Disney+ streaming service this April.\"I mean, I would be up for it.

So our friendship was really close.\"And then when the writers and the creators of the show genuinely saw how close Lamorne and I were, they then started to write it into the show, which is why Winston and Cece became this kind of like very odd but wonderful duo.\"Its a friendship that translated seamlessly onto our screens, including the finer details such as the pairs synchronised finger clicks.\"I remember Lamorne and I on set doing this kind of like, snap, snap thing that kind of moment when we agreed on something.\"And then it made it into the show.\"And it was just a wonderful, genuinely funny moment for me that my weird little friendship that I have in real le with Lamorne had become such a huge part of the show and something that people really liked.\"So I love that I love that people really dig Winston and Cece and their mess arounds.\"The shows lasting legacyComprising of seven series and making up over a hundred hours worth of viewing time, New Girls legacy will continue to live on - both on our screens and as memories for the actors themselves.\"It was almost a decade of my le,\" notes Simone of the shows run.\"Its a huge part of who I am personally now...

One of the main issues with the Westminster system and First Past The Past is that it is not proportional. In theory, the combined vote against the winner is often more than voted for the winner, and Scotlands voting system attempts to tackle this by bringing in a second vote.The Second VoteThe Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support. This system is used to electthe  additional members.The second vote is used to elect  additional members that will complete the political landscape of Holyrood. Scotland is ided into  parliamentary regions and each region elects  regional MSPs. In the second vote the voter votes for a party rather than a candidate.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"janey-godley-george-galloway-jakey-accents-alienating-voters","story":"ldquoThat guy George is obsessed with you a mate on twitter told me, I was very excited.

After all, therersquos nothing like a threat to one and all for some to see it simply as a threat to themselves alone and the rest be damned.Irsquom talking about the Covid- pandemic and the insightful and sometimes rather unedying responses to it by those countries that have adequate defences, towards those countries that do not.Be it vaccine, oxygen, ventilator stocks or general health care provision, you canrsquot help but notice a certain, ldquoIrsquom alright, Jack, mentality increasingly prevalent right now.Arguably, it was always going to be this way once those rich developed nations got over the initial shock of being caught wrongfooted by the virus and began to put their house in order. But my, how quickly and unreservedly that safety ladder has been pulled up letting others sink into the abyss.Donrsquot get me wrong, itrsquos only understandable that there should be a palpable sense of relief here in the UK and any country that has managed to turn a corner in the fight against the pandemic. Whatrsquos far less comprehensible though is the misguided notion of singularity or exceptionalism in a global crisis.If ever one detail was a sharp reminder of that, itrsquos the news that India, one of the worldrsquos biggest producers of vaccines, wonrsquot be exporting many for a while.This means that COVAX, the global initiative aimed at equitable access to the Covid- vaccine, has lost much of the supply produced by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.In the words of one vaccine expert, ldquoright now COVAX has ground to a shuddering halt... wersquore at the point of where wersquore trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.This in turn means that many of the poorer countries that were relying on such supplies will be impacted and even some of the richer ones in Europe and where who are beginning to exit the crisis could well find themselves affected.In other words, here once again is more proof ndashit were needed ndash of the truism that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Whatever happened to those leaders and governments that were once enthusiastic chanters of such a mantra  It didnrsquot take long it seems for them to forget the words to this chorus of caringFor the grim inescapable fact is that while many in the West are cock-a-hoop about the rapid roll out of vaccines, the pandemic is gathering pace where. India is the most obvious recent example, but many now fear that numerous African countries are about to plummet down that same terrible track.ldquoTwo months ago, India was doing a victory dance and handing out vaccines around the world like candies, observed Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance, which is co-ordinating distribution on the continent.ldquoThey were saying how wonderfully they had done because of the immunity and the youth of their population. Look where India is today, was Dr Alakijarsquos timely reminder this week.Indiarsquos catastrophe is all the proof needed, say health experts like her, of what could happen in Africavaccination campaigns are not rapidly accelerated, and the virus is allowed to spread and mutate. And Africa of course is not unique in this respect with South and Central America experiencing another surge that contributed this week to a record near million cases reported globally on a single day.So much of what has unfolded politically around the world during the pandemic has given us an insight, sometimes chilling, into the way global politics and many governments and leaders worldwide operate.What lessons might we take for example from the fact that the top five slots in the geographical mortality rankings all belong to countries run by populists when the pandemic began ndash the US, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Britain.As Gideon Lasco, a leading global medical anthropologist at the University of the Philippines, noted recently ldquomedical populist politicians like Indiarsquos Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and former US president Donald Trump, all rose to power and ruled in populist styles.This allowed for an oversimplication of the pandemic and enabled them to flag up their own frequently misguided solutions while forging isions across their nations in the process.What to make then of the call this week by Gordon Brown to the foreign ministers of the worldrsquos leading economies, meeting in London as part of the G Summit, to fund a bn two-year vaccine and healthcare support package for poor countries On the face of it, Mr Brownrsquos humanitarian rallying call makes sense. But coming as it does in the wake of the UK Governmentrsquos bafflingly stupid decision to cut le-saving overseas aid for water and sanitation projects amid the pandemic, it only underlines the mixed motives and messages coming from nations in the developed world.At its most cynical and some might even argue predatory level, there are those countries, too, who now clearly view their capacity to supply vaccines through the prism of international competition.If we give you desperately needed vaccines, you give us concessions goes the current thinking. These concessions might take the shape of access to natural resources and markets or helping turn the screw on political rivals as China has done in pressuring other countries into derecognising Taiwan infor vaccine supplies.Itrsquos all a far cry from those early days of the pandemic when some global leaders spoke of universal vaccines and aid as a moral course of action and the way to bring about the swtest end to a disease that affects us all.If the pandemic has perhaps taught us anything and is still teaching us, itrsquos the lesson that responding intelligently to a global crisis of this kind depends on people in high office being smart enough to listen and co-operate with one another. Admittedly, there have been some examples of that, but in the main precious few that really matter.Instead, what we are witnessing now is an ever-more clearly defined demarcation line between those nations able and those less able to cope. The ladder is undeniably being hauled up behind the latter.

He was none other than the abolitionist leader and social reformer Frederick Douglass, who passed on the treasure to his son, Lewis, in .From the moment he turned its pages, Frederick Douglass cultivated not only an admiration for Burns, but for the writings of Sir Walter Scott, and a le-long affection for Scotland and the Scottish people.Douglass at his desk at  Gilmore Street in Edinburgh composing persuasive letters and formidable lectures as an anti-slavery activist was only eight years removed from escaping his own trauma of slavery in Maryland in . He must have pondered this as he walked Princes Street or surveyed the city from Calton Hill.:Derided, bullied, but triumphant: the Scottish heroine who planted the seeds of freedomDouglas was in the remarkable position of advocating internationally for human liberty so soon after his own bondage. This rapid rise to prominence was a testament to his talents, but also to the shting moral consciousness of the throngs of people he addressed.He once wrote of Edinburgh: ldquoI enjoy everything here which may be enjoyed by those of a paler hue ndash no distinction here. I have found myself in the society of thehellipfirst people of this city and no one seemed alarmed by my presence.Douglass had initially come to Scotland as part of a tour to Britain and Ireland between  and  and again in  and . His specic engagement with Scotland was to speak out against the Free Church of Scotland which had financed itself through funds that came from slaveholders in the United States.He spoke widely across Scotland, filling up chapels and assembly halls beyond capacity. He first arrived in Glasgow in . Many of his speeches and public appearance in Glasgow were delivered at City Halls in Candleriggs. Audiences and communities responded to his Send Back The Money campaign with fervent support.The story of Douglass in Scotland links to a person he called, \"the single most important influence on his le.\" That personrsquos name was Dr James McCune Smith. A fellow American and former slave, Smith was an extraordinary figure and pioneer.:David Pratt: Indias Covid tragedy shows a tale of two pandemicsHe had been blocked from further education in the United States because he was an African-American. He turned to Scotland and the University of Glasgow which made the bold decision to admit him in the early s. Smith went onto to earn a bachelorrsquos degree, a masterrsquos degree, and his medical doctorate from the University of Glasgow. He was the first African-American to receive a medical degree, and it was from a Scottish university.There is no question that as Douglass embraced Scotland, he was influenced by his close friendrsquos example. To their great credit, the University of Glasgow has named a new pound million facility the James McCune Smith Learning Hub.Douglassrsquo first visit to Scotland ended with a moving stop in Hawick in the Borders. A reporter wrote that Douglass ldquospoke for nearly two hours, in a calm, cool, dignied, and impressive manner, that shewed him to be qualied above most men to command the attention of an audience. He was enthusiastically praised by the spectators, and then with fond farewells departed for northern England. The first Scottish tour of Douglass was monumental in terms of the scale of people he educated, touched and motivated.The spirit of Douglassrsquo legacy is still intact, but as with all historical figures who advocated for progressive social change, their tones and path prints can fade unless we download their voices, trace their footsteps, and disinter their ideas from the clutch of distant history.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys Douglass would have been inspired by todayrsquos Black Lives Matter movement, in fact, he was a courageous catalyst of it. In Scotland, he would have eagerly supported the Black Lives Matter Scottish Mural Trail developed by Wezi Mhura and artists from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, living in Scotland.The trail is a reminder that the work of Douglass for global unity and racial equality is still an unfolding journey around the world. It is a winding road stridden by valiant feet fractured by the trying passage to greater equality. Wherever we are in the world, humanity is duty bound to enter the trail, for each to do our part in marching forward for racial justice and harmony.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an advocate for diplomacy, trade, global poverty alleviation, intercultural dialogue, and as a non-profit leader.

Signicant because it could mean the end of the United Kingdom. At least, that is the view of the London media. The reality is both boring and signicant: there is not going to be a referendum because neither side actually wants one right now.Curiously, the expectation of a referendum seems to be greater in Westminster than in Holyrood. Weve been hearing muffled cries of panic from Whitehall for months. Former Cabinet Office mandarins like Ciaran Martin insist that following this victory for the parties of independence there is ldquono democratically legitimate basis to refuse a referendum. Boris Johnson is still minded to say ldquonow is not the time, but his constitutional insecurity is demonstrated by the fact that hes afraid to show his face in Scotland to defend the Union at this critical juncture.There is talk of a court challenge against the SNPs forthcoming independence bill. Thatsthe Scottish Government doesnt get there first. Theres also going to be ldquobillions on road and rail spending with a Union Flag on it ndash even a ldquofixed crossing to Northern Ireland, or so were told. The Internal Market Act will allow the UK Government to spend over the heads of Holyrood and win hearts and minds. Well, perhaps.Read more: WhatBoris Johnson rejects second referendum Yet curiously, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that this election ldquois not about independence. The very idea! Its about her ldquosensible leadership and recovery from Covid, under the only political leader who seems to want the job. A referendum will not happen until ldquothe crisis is over, which could be many years since the economic Covid crisis has yet to begin.This may seem like a remarkable about-face for the SNP leader. For the past two years, she has talked of little  but a referendum on independence. Even Covid was expressed in constitutional terms: ldquoAn independence referendum is an essential priority, she said repeatedly,Scotland was to build back better after the pandemic.As recently as November, her Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, insisted that there would a referendum ldquonext year by which he meant . The Constitution Secretary, Michael Russell, said in January that the referendum would happen by Christmas, with or without a Section  Order from Westminster. ldquoThe Franchise Act was approved last year, he said, ldquoso the nuts and bolts are there.Buttomorrows election is really all about ldquoseeking a clear endorsement for a referendum on independence as Ms Sturgeon told parliament in September, you might have thought it would be right up there, centre stage. Yet two words absent from the SNP leaflet that came through my door last week were ldquoindependence and ldquoreferendum. It seems it no longer regards it a necessary precondition for Covid recovery or for keeping Mr Johnsons grasping Brexit hands off the fragile powers of the Scottish Parliament.The UK Government regards all this as devious down-playing of indyref rhetoric, all the better to propel Scotland into holding one. On Saturday, it thinks, she will suddenly declare that this election had ldquoof course been about an independence referendum, and that the mandate for holding one is now unanswerable. Ms Sturgeon will no doubt say something like this, but I dont think that means there will be a referendum on the timescale her minions had been suggesting. Ms Sturgeon isnt a loser, and her recent silence on crucial post-Brexit issues of border, currency and debt betrays her lack of confidence in winning any early referendum.Read more: Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe First Minister made clear this week that she favours turning indyref into a battle in the courts. When ldquothis crisis is over Holyrood will pass a bill declaring a referendum and then defy Westminster to strike it down. Actually, it doesnt have to because no act of Holyrood, especially one on the constitution, can pass without the express endorsement of the UK Parliament.It was clear in the Miller case in  that the UK Supreme Court, which would ultimately decide this matter, takes a maximalist view of parliamentary sovereignty. It believes that Westminster can safely ignore any act of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, which supposedly requires Westminster to consent to acts of Holyrood, is just that: a convention. The constitution is one of the reserved powers retained at Westminster under the  Scotland Act.In response, the Scottish Governments lawyers will argue that, while Holyrood cannot legislate for a legally-binding referendum on independence, it can legislate for and hold a consultative referendum. Ms Sturgeon has long accepted that a full-fat referendum would require a Section  Order from Westminster, but an indy-lite plebiscite, just asking the views of Scottish voters, is probably within Holyroods powers. Local authorities are empowered to hold referendums on water privatisation and road pricing, so why shouldnt Holyrood Whether she would actually want such a non-binding referendum is of course another matter. I seriously doubtshe would because it would likely be meaningless. Since it carries no constitutional weight, most unionists would likely boycott it. It would be like the  Catalonian referendum in which  per cent voted Yes on a % turnout. It might carry even less meaning than a series of opinion polls, which are probably a more accurate reflection of what Scotland actually thinks.So why bother with pursuing this through the courts  Well, perhaps because it would be a way of parking the whole independence issue. Indeed, fighting a phoney war about a referendum that will never happen might suit both sides. Passions would overflow in the synthetic world of social media while lawyers exchanged abstruse formulations of a problem that doesnt actually exist about a referendum that would never happen.Its something a French post-modernist, like Jean Baudrillard would instantly recognise: a meta-battle fought over signs and signiers of independence rather than self-government itself.

Most local authorities provide a bin for residents to put their food and garden waste in, for weekly or fortnightly collection and recycling, many miles from the point of collection. However, for anyone with a garden or allotment there is a much simpler, easier, and cheaper solution Using pallets or other waste wood, why not construct a home-composting system  Nearly all food waste, with the possible exception of meat and fish, can be put in your bin add grass cuttings, cardboard , shredded paper, annual weeds, some seaweed, and horse or cow manure. When full, turn into an empty bin and start filling the first one again. By the end of a summer you will have a large bin full of nourishment for your garden for next year.

We havenrsquot seen anything like that to date, and the question yoursquore asking is the million dollar question in many ways, everybody wants to know whatrsquos the likelihood and when is it likely to occur,at all.ldquoWhat we donrsquot know isit is likely to occur. We know that as mutations accumulate in the virus, it can actually make it more fit in terms of avoiding our immune system, but the more mutations it accumulates, it could actually lead to a virus that is less infectious, for example. vw,vw,px, px\"Scientists say that none of the known Covid iants can fully evade current vaccines ldquoSo therersquos a trade-off for the virus in terms of how many mutations it can tolerate.ldquoNow, some people have predicted that a virus could emerge that is pretty resistant to vaccines, but we havenrsquot seen any hint of that at the moment.ldquoAnd the idea that this could arise is based on models from previous viruses, not this current one, so at the moment, I remain optimistic that wersquore in a good place ndash that the viruses that are circulating are susceptible to vaccinations.ldquoAnd the key thing is to get on and vaccinate the world so that we can clamp down [on] disease. If we can reduce disease rates, then we reduce the risk of iants arising in the first place.Prof Peacock said work was ongoing to look at the iant first identied in India, including whether it could spread in the UK compared to the Kent iant.The Indian government has said the coronavirus iant first discovered there in March may be linked to its deadly second wave.Samples for the B.. iant have been found in several states with high case numbers, it said.The National Centre for Disease Control said, however, that it had still been unable to fully establish a correlation.Asked about the iant, which has been found in a small number of cases in the UK and is currently regarded as a iant under investigation, Prof Peacock said: ldquoMy eyes are constantly now looking at the pattern of spread within the United Kingdom to see whether this iant is able to spread in our population under current restrictions.ldquoTherersquos no evidence at the moment that the iant described in India, which we call B.., is resistant to the vaccine, far more work needs to be done.ldquoVery early work suggests that itrsquos not as resistant as, say, the iant first described in South Africa.ldquoBut what we donrsquot know about this particular iant from India is how transmissible it is, so thatrsquos the other key question.ldquoThe big question for me, is whether the Indian iant is also particularly transmissible.ldquoNow we can see that through experimental work, but the key is to watch it in the population, to see whether itrsquos associated with outbreaks and spread in the community.ldquoI know that Public Health England are really looking very carefully at that because thatrsquos a sign that under the circumstances wersquore under in terms of our current restrictions, whether that is spreading is a key signal ndash a public health signal of transmissibility.ldquoWersquod obviously have to prove that scientically, but thatrsquos a really key thing to watch out for. vw,vw,px, px\"Prof Peacock suggested richer nations should be doing all they can to help vaccinate people in poorer countries.She said: ldquoWe in wealthy countries should be thinking about people who are less fortunate than ourselves, and added: ldquoWe should be vaccinating the world on a moral standpoint, but also vaccinating the world to try and reduce the rate of infection, so that we protect people from an untimely death, but also reduce the risk of iants emerging in the first place, because ultimately in the long-term, that is one of the major threats to us controlling this pandemic.Asked whether Covid will become like annual seasonal flu, she said: ldquoThe idea that the virus will become like a common cold and nobody will notice it by next spring is far too optimistic.ldquoAnd so it could take one or two generations before we see a virus that starts to, what we say attenuate, which means it causes less severe disease, and so, I think, what we have to do is tackle the problem thatrsquos in front of us at the moment and not put too much store in the fact that the virus is going to evolve into something thatrsquos really rather harmless.ldquoThatrsquos been seen for other viruses, but thatrsquos over a process of decades and hundreds of years, and wersquore talking about being in the very early stages, [we] still have a pandemic, so we canrsquot guarantee that thatrsquos the trajectory of the virus right now.The comments come as Canada became the first country to authorise a vaccine for children aged  to .It authorised Pfizer after studies showed the jab worked well in that age group.copy -.

I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing.

They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

Picture Martin McKeown.Donna DeeneyTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe failure to fully develop two prime sites gted to Londonderry by the Ministry of Defence almost  years ago is down to a lack of government interest, an MLA has said.Earlier this week, it was announced that a military canteen in Ebrington Square was to get a new lease of le as a restaurant.Derry City and Strabane District Council’s planning committee approved works for ‘Building ’ to be transformed into a bar and restaurant with landscaping and associated works.But Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin said progress at Ebrington and Fort George had been too slow, and blamed a lack of government interest in seeing both sites reach their full potential.She has raised the matter with the Executive Office and the Department for Communities, which are responsible for the development of the two former Army bases.The development of Ebrington, which was used as barracks, was initially under the remit of a dedicated company, Ilex, but was later ed to the portfolio of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister, now the Executive Office.This was because of a perceived lack of progress in developing key projects for Ebrington, such as a maritime museum announced by Ilex in .A planning application for a maritime museum and archive was lodged last month by the Department for Infrastructure.Permission to transform a key building at Ebrington into office space was also approved last month.But Ms McLauglin hit out at the slow progress made over almost two decades.She said: It is now  years since the British Government agreed to transfer the sites to the people of Derry and  years since that transfer happened. Yet both sites are nowhere near where they should be.While parts of Ebrington are now occupied and other buildings are being renovated, there is no excuse for how slow this has been.Ebrington has been held back for several reasons. At its heart, I do not believe that the Executive Office, and its predecessor, the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, have treated the site as a priority.Capital funding was drip-fed, slowing down progress by years. This was a failure of political leadership that has treated the people of Derry with contempt.Ebrington was supposed to be a project that would turn around Derry#s economy, yet after  years we are still waiting to see it properly realised.Across the River Foyle at Fort George, another prime riverfront location, signs of development are not immediately obvious, with a large office block being the sole occupant.In March, the Department for Communities agreed a £million health hub could be located at Fort George. No start date for this project has been announced.Ms McLauglin said the development of Fort George was even more lacking than Ebrington.She added: Fort George is in an even worse situation. After  years, it is mostly empty. It is likely to be several more years before the proposed new health campus is built.There is a consistent story here, which is that despite Derry having the worst job statistics in Northern Ireland, the Government fails to treat Derry as a priority. In practice, it is a policy of #Derry can wait#.The Executive Office and Department for Communities were contacted for comment.Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices where we#ll be in decade#s timeVictims and politicians condemn Government’s Troubles ‘amnesty’ planBereaved families voice hurt and anger at Troubles ‘amnesty’ planCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffLatestNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices where we#ll be in decade#s timeBilly WeirOpinionCould Countdown#s Susie Dent have brought Line of Duty#s limp finish around sooner Dollingstown chairman Hubert Watson on daunting task of facing Larne and Kenny Bruce Air fares to Portugal soar ahead of green list announcementPhotos of schoolboy who fell from Tower Bridge released by family,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ralph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP have remained tight-lipped as nominations closed for a new party leader and deputy leader on Thursday.Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP have both launched their bids to succeed Arlene Foster.It is unclear who has put their name forward for deputy leader after Lord Nigel Dodds said he would not bid to remain in the role after holding the position for  years.Mrs Foster said she would resign as DUP leader on May  and as First Minister at the end of June.The electoral college is made up of the party’s MPs and MLAs and they will vote for their new leader on Friday, May .In order to become party leader, a candidate must secure the support of at least  of the DUP’s MLAs and MPs.The DUP has been approached for comment on who has put their names forward for the roles.The deadline for nominations was pm on Thursday.Lagan Valley MLA Mr Poots sent a four-page document to his party colleagues telling them thathe becomes leader, he will aim to “restore the party’s fortunes and rebuild unionism”.He added that he will restructure and re-energise the DUP as he confirmed that he will split the jobs of First Minister and party leader.Meanwhile, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to rebuild a “shared future for Northern Ireland” during his campaign launch in Belfast on Monday.It comes after the News Letter reported that the party has issued a gagging order on both Mr Poots and Sir Jeffrey, banning them from speaking to the media in the run up to the internal elections.It is the first leadership contest in the DUP’s -year history.The gagging order was issued by the DUP press office on Tuesday and stated that party officers had decided that “no candidate is to be fielded by the party for media appearances interview during the period of the leadership during the period of the leadership campaign”.“This applies to both candidates for leader and deputy leader positions,” continued the guidance note.It continued: “No candidate is to unilaterally give broadcast or print interviews about their candidature.”Other party representatives are still permitted to speak to the media but have been advised not to commentate on a preferred candidate or any campaign.Explaining why leader and deputy leader candidates cannot speak to the media, a spokesperson for the DUP stated: “The party officers have taken decisions as to the processes for the election campaign, including the fact that candidates will not be fielded by the party for media opportunities during this time.“Candidates, rather than the apparatus of the party, will continue to promote themselves to the electoral college at this time.“All candidates who have thus far publicly indicated their intention to run have been advised of the details of these matters.”Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathBryson hits out at policing and NI Protocol as loyalists stage protest in MarkethillTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices where we#ll be in decade#s timeVictims and politicians condemn Government’s Troubles ‘amnesty’ planBereaved families voice hurt and anger at Troubles ‘amnesty’ planCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffLatestNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices where we#ll be in decade#s timeBilly WeirOpinionCould Countdown#s Susie Dent have brought Line of Duty#s limp finish around sooner Dollingstown chairman Hubert Watson on daunting task of facing Larne and Kenny Bruce Brighton chief hopes Graham Potter stays at the club ‘for many years to come’A Quiet Place breaks silence with trailer for much-delayed sequel,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is arguably one of the least affected sectors from the ious lockdown restrictions.“Only  manufacturing jobs came off furlough in March relative to the previous month. That means a sizeable , jobs within manufacturing, or  in  of all jobs, are currently out of action.“The concern is that a signicant number of these jobs may be lost when the furlough scheme expires.

Read MoreCentenary poll: % in Northern Ireland want referendum but would not accept higher taxes to fund reunicationCentenary poll suggests only % of people in Northern Ireland consider Irish language to be importantEsmond Birnie:OpinionOur economy needs recuperation, not a constitutional shockThe Union would be better served by making strong economic arguments for its preservation, rather than politicians heading down the rabbit hole of poking their noses into people#s bedrooms and private lives.Our poll findings suggests that nationalists have a job of work to do to make a strong financial case for a united Ireland, although that is certainly not an impossible task.!fordocument.querySelectortThe Scottish Government produced a -page white paper laying out the case for independence in . There is no sign that a similarly comprehensive blueprint is on the horizon from nationalists here.Our poll indicates that the strongest argument unionists could employ is that Irish unity would hit people in their pockets on both sides of the border.More than half in Northern Ireland think they#d be worse off with just % believing they#d prosper. But % of people were unsure, meaning that the economic arguments on both sides really need to be formed and aired.!fordocument.querySelectortIn the Republic, four in  thought they#d be worse off in a united Ireland, one in five disagreed, and a staggering % didn#t know. If RTE hasn#t already planned it, another Claire Byrne Live to shed light on this part of the debate would be warmly welcomed.A majority on both sides of the border said they wouldn#t be prepared to pay more taxes to fund Irish unity.!fordocument.querySelectortNorthern Ireland currently receives a £bn annual subvention from Westminster. Almost half of people in the Republic said they#d match thator pay some of it . A third were totally opposed to doing so.But the £bn figure is disputed. It#s the UK statistical calculation that encompasses costs which nationalists believe wouldn#t transfer to a new united Ireland. Those costs include UK government debt interest, contributions to the UK armed forces and pension liabilities.!fordocument.querySelectortStill, Northern Ireland#s low cost of living and high number of public sector jobs will be extremely successful weaponsunionists are forced to do battle in a border poll.The jewel in the crown will of course be the NHS. Six in  voters here would be uncomfortable about transferring to the Republic#s health service.Changing it to a system similar to the NHS with free access and no prescription charges would surely be essential for nationalists in a future referendum. The British Treasury footing the bill during the pandemic for the furlough scheme also gives unionists strong ammunition.However, nationalists will be able to use Northern Ireland#s poor infrastructure, low wages, and very small private sector in their arguments. They will also suggest that considerable economic opportunities and potential investment could open up in the event of Irish unity.This poll gives Irish unity campaigners many reasons to pause for thought. Yet it also counters claims made by those who oppose constitutional change. The idea that the south doesn#t want the north is contradicted.More than two-thirds of people in the Republic support Irish unity with just % against.In Northern Ireland, there was a clear pro-Union lead - % to %, with % undecided.Some % of people here want a border poll compared to % opposed in the Republic two-thirds want one. Among referendum supporters, seven in  on both sides of the border want one now or within five years. Those figures suggest that the Taoiseach, who has dragged his feet on the issue and ruled out a border poll in coming years, is out of step with voters.The th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in  is the date many nationalists are now speaking of for a referendum.The economic recovery of both the UK and the Republic post-pandemic will be key to the unity debate. If one state fares remarkably better than the other that will sway a signicant amount of Northern Ireland voters.Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices where we#ll be in decade#s timeBilly WeirOpinionCould Countdown#s Susie Dent have brought Line of Duty#s limp finish around sooner Dollingstown chairman Hubert Watson on daunting task of facing Larne and Kenny Bruce A Quiet Place breaks silence with trailer for much-delayed sequelPrank TV show in Iraq depicting IS attacks is taken off air,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those who favour a united Ireland have responded in a number of ways to this situation:Deny the figures - yes, about £bn of the transfer is an attributing to NI of spending done by the UK central government . But, in a united Ireland surely some of such spending would continue Claim taxes could rise - they could, but, as this poll shows, there would be considerable opposition to that, especially in the Republic.Claim public spending in NI could be scaled back - it is one thing to argue our public sector is too large in relative terms, but any sudden adjustment would probably provoke a major recession. Claim a united Ireland could out-grow the problem - true, in recent years the Republic#s economic growth rate has surpassed that in NI, even discounting the tax-avoiding behaviour of multinationals, but can we really assume that unity per se would have a sudden transformative impact on NI#s economic performance Claim that the Dublin government could borrow to keep NI afloat - at the moment, interest rates are very low, but that won#t always be true.Argue that the UK Government would leave its cheque book behind - in the s, the London government wrote off the Irish Free State#s obligation for part of the UK#s public debt, but can we really imagine a UK government being so generous as to wipe out debt and continue to pay for some welfare benefitsand subsidise NI#s infrastructure To be fair, this existence of the big fiscal deficit is also problematic for unionists. They could claim other UK regions have deficits. They do, but none are so large. They could try to argue this is a form of UK solidarity payment, but will that really wash with taxpayers in south-east England The biggest danger is that a long-term dependency on subsidy from Great Britain has actually distorted economic behaviour. As RHI exemplied, free money trumps making necessary reforms.One particularly interesting area of Northern Ireland-Republic comparisons is healthcare: a major focus of the Kantar Belfastpoll.The south uses a mixture of state provision and private insurance. The polling response shows a very strong preferences in NI to continue with the NHS model. That said, the advantages of free at the point of use are blunted by our ening waiting lists.OECD data implies healthcare spending per person in the Republic now exceeds that in NI and the UK average.Of course, as indicated by US experience, very high spending does not necessarily bring better quality. We know the dference in Covid vaccination rates.To finish with a health analogy, for all its points of strength, the NI economy remains in need of intensive care - a period of recuperation, rather than a major constitutional shock is probably the priority.Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at Ulster UniversityBelfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices where we#ll be in decade#s timeBilly WeirOpinionCould Countdown#s Susie Dent have brought Line of Duty#s limp finish around sooner Dollingstown chairman Hubert Watson on daunting task of facing Larne and Kenny Bruce Brighton chief hopes Graham Potter stays at the club ‘for many years to come’A Quiet Place breaks silence with trailer for much-delayed sequel,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Graphic designer Ryan met the part-time dog groomer in  before proposing a year later in front of Disneyland Paris’s Sleeping Beauty Castle.As first reported in the Strabane Chronicle, when he and Megan began planning their wedding and looked into the possibility of renting a photo booth, Ryan instead decided to create his own photo prop.“I’m just a real cheapskate. As the money we were spending started to ratchet up, I just thought I would make it myself,” he told the Belfast .“I have already made all the centrepieces for tables from each of the houses of the Seven Kingdoms, including the Lannisters, Starks and Targaryens.We have done our wedding invites in the theme and there will be pop-up banners. This extra addition was just supposed to be a bit of fun, but now it’s all gone a bit mad.”Thanks to Ryan’s efforts, the wedding guests, whether Games of Thrones fans or not, will have the chance to sit on the iconic Iron Throne and rule like a king or queen of Westeros,only for a few moments.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRyan McDevitt on the Iron Throne he built for his wedding in July FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRyan McDevitt on the Iron Throne he built for his wedding in JulyIn the land of Westeros, the Iron throne was made by Aegon Targaryen, the first king of the Seven Kingdoms, from swords surrendered by his enemies.According to the show’s lore, the throne was made from , swords over  days. Spikes and jagged edges in every direction make it one very intimidating seat.In Ryan’s case, he had to make do with plastic swords purchased from the internet. “I went to loads of charity shops in search of the right chair and finally came across a really old-fashioned one, like what you see in your granny’s house,” he said.“I ripped all the cushion off the chair, stripped it down to the bare bones and then built up from the base.I got big sheets of plywood from a building supplier, made a stencil for the back part and worked from there.Then I bought a load of medieval plastic swords from eBay. I got yoga mats too and cut them up to be wrapped around the chair.“I started work on the throne last year, just before Covid hit, and worked on it bit by bit. I’m also planning a Dof Jon Snow’s famous Longclaw sword as another wedding photo prop.”And what about the all-important bride-to-be’s verdict  “I think it’s class,” said Megan. “It’s our wedding, so we may as well go all-out. I had no idea how it would turn out, but it looks amazing. I hope our family and friends think so too.”Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathBryson hits out at policing and NI Protocol as loyalists stage protest in MarkethillTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices on where we#ll be in decade#s timeVictims and politicians condemn Government’s Troubles ‘amnesty’ planBereaved families voice hurt and anger at Troubles ‘amnesty’ planCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffLatestJohn MulgrewOpinionNo expense spared as Hinch Distillery comes to fruitionNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices on where we#ll be in decade#s timeBilly WeirOpinionCould Countdown#s Susie Dent have brought Line of Duty#s limp finish around sooner Dollingstown chairman Hubert Watson on daunting task of facing Larne and Kenny Bruce Brighton chief hopes Graham Potter stays at the club ‘for many years to come’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Olivier Hoslet AP.Gareth CrossTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe EU#s chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier has described how he nearly lost his cool with the DUP during discussions about the UK#s withdrawal process.In a new book on Brexit published this week, Mr Barnier said that senior DUP figures regarded him as a puppet of the Irish government during negotiations and alleged that they wanted to use the Brexit process to help prevent a united Ireland.He also expressed frustration at the party#s inflexibility during the negotiations, saying they were unwilling to compromise, but also had no positive solutions of their own to put forward.Mr Barnier said he felt peace in Ireland was vulnerable to the slightest spark amid ongoing dissent over the Northern Ireland Protocol.He also condemned the EU#s threat to trigger Article  of the protocol in a row over vaccine supply#s.“That went directly against our efforts and the responsible attitude we had held during the previous four and a half years, precisely to avoid theof a hard Border in the middle of the island of Ireland, often in the face of British provocations. And these provocations continue, unfortunately, he said.#The Grand Illusion# was published in French on Thursday, with an English language version to follow in the Autumn.In it the former French foreign minister details his diary as the UK and EU worked to reach a withdrawal agreement following the Brexit referendum in .Among his recollections of a myriad of high stakes meetings between - are a number of notable parleys with the DUP.On March   he met with DUP leader Arlene Foster, then MEP Diane Dodds, the party#s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson and advisor Timothy Johnston.Mr Barnier recalled Mrs Dodds took the lead in the meeting, and that left him unsure who held power within the party.He said the DUP accused the EU Commission of being the puppets of Dublin, which they detest, and we would like to create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK so as to avoid one in the middle of the island.The EU#s chief negotiator met with Mrs Foster and Mrs Dodds again in October  shortly before then Prime Minister Theresa May reached a deal with the bloc, which was rejected by the House of Commons and DUP MPs.Mr Barnier said he felt of the DUP pair both of them don’t like each other and it shows.He also accused them of preparing exaggerated rhetoric before attending the meeting.Listening to these two women, I had dficulty keeping calm and I wonderedTheresa May will have the courage and will not to give in to their demands. They are opposed to everything, want nothing to do with the concrete proposals we are making, the diplomat recalled.Mr Barnier said he told Mrs Foster and Mrs Dodds: It is your Brexit vote which creates the problem. We are waiting for you to bring forward ideas and proposals. You have produced none. When will you therefore assume the consequences of your own actions However, he is not entirely negative, saying Mrs Dodds was elegant and competent, while Mrs Foster was percise and pragmatic in her questions. He also praised former UUP MEP Jim Nicholson for his sincerity.In the book he admits a fondness for Ireland, noting his work on PEACE funding as EU Commissioner for Regional Policy in the early s.Mr Barnier also recalls how one of his political heroes, legendary French President Charles De Gaulle also enjoyed visits to Ireland, and referenced the  book #Return to Killybegs# by French author Sorj Chalandon, which was inspired by the killing of former Sinn Fein insider turned British agent Denis Donaldson.I promised myself in these negotiations not to give in to controversy or to the attacks from British tabloids, to be careful with language, to stick to the facts, figures, the legal basis, in short not to allow room for emotion or sentiment, for the sake of objectivity, he said.But then, in Ireland, where I recall the terrible pages of the book Return to Killybegs, it is dficult not to be affected by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express it, the memories which remind me of this tragedy.The DUP has been contacted for a response. Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathHigh street vouchers not for Christmas shopping, MLAs toldTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest PoliticsNorthern Ireland in  : Young voices on where we#ll be in decade#s timeAnger over reports UK Government planning blanket Troubles amnestyBill WhiteOpinionThe seats that could decideScotland gets another vote on independenceEdwin Poots pledges to restore DUP’s fortunes as he publishes manesto Nelson McCauslandOpinionDUP must recover its passion... and new leader has to deliverLatestJohn MulgrewOpinionNo expense spared as Hinch Distillery comes to fruitionBilly WeirOpinionCould Countdown#s Susie Dent have brought Line of Duty#s limp finish around sooner Northern Ireland in  : Young voices on where we#ll be in decade#s timeDollingstown chairman Hubert Watson on daunting task of facing Larne and Kenny Bruce Latest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A media briefing was held on Tuesday where the Trust revealed that over  per cent of care home residents have been inoculated. According to Dr Bob Brown, Executive Director of Nursing Primary Care and Older Peoples services, there has also been a ‘very good response’ amongst care home staff. The Trust previously stated that  per cent of care home staff had accepted the vaccine. There are currently no Covid outbreaks in local care homes. The Trust provides care for over , service users in their own homes every day. There has been  per cent vaccine uptake amongst home care staff. googletag.cmd.push Information on vaccine uptake amongst hospital staff and Trust-wide numbers are not available, the meeting heard. Dr Bob Brown, Executive Director of Nursing Primary Care and Older Peoples services in theWestern Trust explained: “I would say that’s not information that we would be providing on the basis that we cannot ask iniduals, have you or have you not had a vaccine,” he explained. “Therefore, we’re working on the basis of exit information. We know we’ve had an increasingly positive uptake but, he said, it’s dficult to provide evidence of specic numbers in each area.” Askedstaff on high-risk hospital wards would be encouraged to take the vaccine, such as those who treat cancer patients, he said: “We’ll certainly use every opportunity we can through our leadership walks to encourage uptake of the vaccine, that’s something as a corporate management team that we have taken as a priority in recent weeks, to absolutely do that.” googletag.cmd.push Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen added: “We continue to have very stringent infection control measures at ward level, continue to have the use of PPE and social distancing as far as possible. “So those measures remain in force and are continually monitored and encouraged by ourselves. “The vaccine is another line of defence but we always will adhere to the very high levels of PPE and infection control at clinical patient contact level.” The prospect of another wave of infections was raised at the media briefing. Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals, said there is some data which assures the Trust ‘no high surge’ is anticipated over the summer but a ‘small spike’ could take place at the end of Autumn and beginning of Winter.     She continued: “That would be normal winter pressures and respiratory disease so we’re not surethere would be any additional spike there due to Covid. “That’s the basic information we have at this time.” Dr Kilgallen encouraged the public to take the vaccine and adhere to restrictions to allow the Trust and wider NHS to treat other important health issues. “Take the vaccine when it’s offered but also be aware that restrictions that remain are in our best interests and we should do our best to comply at all times,” she said. ‘VOLUNTARY’ A debate has been ongoing in other parts of the UK about whether the vaccine should be mandatory for care home staff or those working in high-risk areas. The Derry News lodged Freedom of Information requests with the Western Trust, Health and Social Care Board and Department of Health- which oversees the running of the programme - to get a detailed breakdown of vaccine uptake amongst staff. In response, each organisation said it did not hold the information. The DoH explained that thevaccinationprogramme remains voluntary but where uptake is lower than average staff will be ‘encouraged’ to accept the vaccine. A spokesperson said: “As cohorts become eligible, iniduals make their own decisions about stepping forward forvaccination. “The Department does not routinely record reasons why people choose not to bevaccinated. “As the programme proceeds and more information becomes available on uptake rates within particular parts of the HSC workforce, action will be taken to try and encourage uptake in any areas where the uptake levels remains lower than average.” The DoH believes that overall, there has been a ‘good uptake’ of thevaccineamongst health and social care staff. More detailed data will be available in the coming weeks, a spokesperson said. She concluded: “This will enable the Department and Trusts to drill down and obtain more granular data regarding the ious parts of the health service andnecessary focus on those areas with lower uptake rates.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.

Despite lining out minus the services of dual star Keith Higgins, they raced into a seven-point lead early on thanks to a Darren McTigue goal.

By half-time, Derry had built up a - to - lead with Paul Cleary on finding his range and a penalty from Ruairi Convery. Although Mayo were dominating possession Derry continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over and three points in four minutes midway through the second half put real daylight between the sides.

Early scores from Alan Grant, Oisin McCloskey and a monstrous effort from goalkeeper Michael Kirkpatrick put Derry in cruise control – and set them on their way to a - to - half-time lead. Mayo showed exactly why they have made such a superb start to their campaign in the second period as they held the home side to just a single point, with dual star Keith Higgins and substitute Kenny Feeney instrumental.

I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection.

The bars had been planning to open for outdoor eating and drinking as part of the latest easing of Covid- restrictions. However, they have now been told that they cannot reopen due to guidelines what constitutes an outdoor space. The Department of Health said the general rule of thumb is that outdoor premises should not be more than % enclosed. The definition of enclosed and substantially enclosed comes from the smoke-free legislation from  and is directly referenced in the restriction regulations, a spokesperson said. This was the same definition that was in place since last July and is not part of the recent amendments which will allow outdoor hospitality to open from  April. googletag.cmd.push Among the local pubs impacted are the Magnet Bar at Culmore, Molly Malones in Ballymagroarty and the Happy Landing in Eglinton. They have had to inform customers that they will not be able honour bookings made for Friday. These pubs will now have to wait until May  when indoor bars will be allowed to reopen. Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the interpretation of regulations was far too stringent. The idea of outdoor [hospitality] being opened again is meaninglessonly a relatively small number of venues can actually make it work, he said. Many will have prepared for reopening by buying thousands of pounds worth of stock to replenish their empty bars, only to be told that their set up does not meet the regulations, despite being open to the same standard in previous failed reopening phases. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This marks the latest stage of the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Hospitality businesses can also reopen but must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Gyms and swimming pools, including those based in leisure centres, can only open for inidual training or for one-to-one coaching with a personal trainer. Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with  people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences have also been removed. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr BrianTierney, has asked the public to support local businesses as more prepare to reopen today. He said that it has been an incredibly challenging year for so many businesses within the district, and he asked that the public do what they can to support them while also adhering to health guidelines. I know there will be many businesses across our city and district really excited to open their doors today after a turbulent and dficult past year. I hope that everyone will support those businesses in the weeks and months ahead as they try toto normality, said MayorTierney. googletag.cmd.push In doing so, I would ask everyone to please make sure theyre following the health guidelines in place including wearing a face mask where required and always maintaining social distancing. It really is brilliant to see businesses reopen, but we also have to be mindful that the COVID- virus is still in our community so the best way that we can help our local businesses is by following the guidelines while in stores and out and about.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Grade A listed building also known as ‘The People’s Hall,’ was the venue of choice for some of the world’s most iconic performers and notaries after it was built in . But how many people nowadays know that its remarkable guests included both Emmeline Pankhurst and Eleanor Marx   Emmeline Pankhurstwas the leader of the radical suffragette movement that played a key role in helping to win British women the right to vote. googletag.cmd.push She was founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union and gave a rousing speech in St Columb’s Hall on th October . Eleanor Marx, the daughter of German socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, organised a trade union recruitment drive for Derry’s mainly female factory workers in St Columb’s Hall on th November , just five years after the distinctive venue was built at Orchard Street within the Walled City. Friends of the Factories  “in solidarity with” Derry Trades Union Council, organised the placement of two plaques side by side to coincide with events to mark May Day weekend, the annual celebration of workers and union rights across the world. googletag.cmd.push The plaque erected in memory of Emmeline Pankhurst was a tribute shared with Margaret Cousins, the Irish and Indian suffragettewho attended Victoria High School in Derry. Co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League, Dublin in , she was credited with organising and inviting Pankhurst to speak at St Columb’s Hall in . The plaque dedicated to Eleanor Marx who visited the Hall almost  years before Pankhurst, reads: “Eleanor Marx, Fighter for socialism and women’s rights . In this hall, th November , Eleanor launched a recruitment drive for women and general workers previously excluded from most union activity.     The organisation of Derry shirt factory workers was a key moment in the development of trades unionism in Britain and Ireland.” Yvonne Norris, local campaigner with Friends of the Factories , said: “Friends of the Factories came together at the most dficult of times, united in doing something positive by contributing to the legacy of the factory workers and their contribution to the City. I have been honoured to be part of an initiative made up of so many formidable women, driven by women and achieved by women. We thank the Derry Trades Union Council for their unwavering support of our project, it has got us to the point we have reached today. As well as the ceremony in honour of the two female revolutionary thinkers who addressed rallies in St Columb’s Hall, plaques to honour the legacy of the workers were also unveiled at a number of former shirt factory sites including Welch Margeston, Sinclair, Ebrington, Rosemount, Hogg  Mitchell and the City Factory. Anne-Marie Gallagher, Project Director of St Columb’s Hall, said she was delighted that the roles of three illustrious women historically associated with the venue, had finally been etched into the fabric of the building more than a century later. She said: “These beautul plaques are very much in keeping with the character of the Hall and add to the already vibrant story of Derry’s built heritage and history. The fact that these remarkable women left such a lasting legacy is very poignant, especially to think that they were standing in here over  years ago. “We are thankful to Friends of the Factories and Derry Trades Union Council for their foresight and determination in shining the spotlight on the somewhat lesser-known connections with this building’s rich history to the wider world.” St Columb’s Hall is located on the East Wall of the city’s historic Walls and was originally built in  by the St Columb’s Hall Total Abstinence Society as part of the Temperance movement. Now used as a noted conference and events venue, the building is currently in the midst of a major regeneration project.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This will be a vital economic and social driver for the Creggan area and City wide.” Stephen McGeehan, Head of Operations for Ulster GAA, said: “Every GAA club is keen to develop the best facilities for their members, which allow their teams across all ages to develop their skills and increase fitness and wellbeing. “But there are always limitations on how this can be done, and we are delighted that Sean Dolan’s have been able to partner with Radius Housing on this amazing and far reaching project. “This will bring an incredible level of community benefit, not just to the club, but to the wider city area, and we hope it is a new partnership model which can be replicated in other GAA and sports clubs.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has welcomed commencement ofthework on the new much needed social homes in the city. “I’m delighted to see this work started. My priority is to deliver housing in areas where it is needed,and Derry City needs more housing. “This pound million investment is part of my new build programme, a programme I was able to secure poundmillion to be invested this year. “I commendthe work of Radius Housing and Sean Dolan’s GAC for working together on this ground breaking scheme. “This is co-operative working at its very best and I look forward to seeing the finished scheme in due course. “I look forward to seeing other developments in the near future as we continue to deliver the biggest shake up of our housing system in over  years. “Housing, and having a place to call home, is a fundamental right. I am committed to delivering a housing system that delivers rights to everyone across society.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This will be a vital economic and social driver for the Creggan area and City wide.” Stephen McGeehan, Head of Operations for Ulster GAA, said: “Every GAA club is keen to develop the best facilities for their members, which allow their teams across all ages to develop their skills and increase fitness and wellbeing. “But there are always limitations on how this can be done, and we are delighted that Sean Dolan’s have been able to partner with Radius Housing on this amazing and far reaching project. “This will bring an incredible level of community benefit, not just to the club, but to the wider city area, and we hope it is a new partnership model which can be replicated in other GAA and sports clubs.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has welcomed commencement ofthework on the new much needed social homes in the city. “I’m delighted to see this work started. My priority is to deliver housing in areas where it is needed,and Derry City needs more housing. “This pound million investment is part of my new build programme, a programme I was able to secure poundmillion to be invested this year. “I commendthe work of Radius Housing and Sean Dolan’s GAC for working together on this ground breaking scheme. “This is co-operative working at its very best and I look forward to seeing the finished scheme in due course. “I look forward to seeing other developments in the near future as we continue to deliver the biggest shake up of our housing system in over  years. “Housing, and having a place to call home, is a fundamental right. I am committed to delivering a housing system that delivers rights to everyone across society.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It didnrsquot sink in until I was driving away from the ceremony and it was a great feeling.The jump jockey star first began his interest in horses after watching the races at Downpatrick Racecourse with his family when he was just eight years old. Since then, he carried on visiting the local racetrack with friends and soon caught the racing bug.ldquoI went to a few point-to-pointers with the McCartan family who we know well. It wasnrsquot long after that I got on the saddle for the first time and I got going from there, said Danny.The golden boy started off with Downpatrick trainer Brian Hamilton before working with group one winning flat trainer Ger Lyons in Kildare.On the advice of former Grand National winner Tony Dobbin, Danny then made his big move across the water to Penrith in Cumbria to work under the highly respected trainer Nicky Richards at his famous Greystoke stables.ldquoI was only  when I turned professional and made the move to England. I was very nervous, but Nicky made me feel really welcomed and I settled in quickly, he recalled.ldquoIt was tough at the beginning to be fair but Nicky is very easy to get on with and he knew it was going to be dficult for me. He made things very straight forward and it didnrsquot take long for me to get the hang of things.The rider credits the first big moment of his blossoming career to when he rode the   shot Nietzsche, trained by Brian Ellison, to first place in the grade three Greatwood Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham when he was just  in November .ldquoIt was something that was unexpected and maybe came a bit out of the blue. It really helped my career and put me on the radar to a lot of people.Danny has ridden a number of horses on his path to success but does share a special bond with one in particular.ldquoNuts Well is my favourite horse.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost.

There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of the Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Since , the local authority has been progressing with plans to restore the natural and built heritage of the forest park with several key stakeholders including the Forest Service.The councilrsquos vision is to create a heritage-led destination which protects the heritage of Castlewellan Forest Park for future generations, whilst also providing opportunities for local people and visitors to learn more about the landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Peatlands.jpg","title":"Peatlands strategy call  ","story":"STORMONT environment minister Edwin Poots has been asked to set up a cross-departmental taskforce to respond to the recent malicious wildfire in the Mournes.The call by South Down MP Chris Hazzard comes after an online petition was set up a by a Newcastle resident urging Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ban the sale of disposal barbecues.The huge blaze mdash which took almost three days to control mdash was battled by  firefighters at its height and was one of the biggest ever gorse fires ever witnessed in Northern Ireland.Almost  acres of precious habitat were destroyed and the scars left in an area of outstanding natural beauty will take many years to heal.Huge flames fanned by winds and dficult terrain presented firefiighters with signicant challenges as they worked around the clock to save as much of a landscape teaming with le as they could during what was a complex operation.The environmental impact of the blaze which could be seen up to  miles away has been described as ldquoimmeasurable.Mr Hazzard has this week urged the environment minister to publish what he described as a ldquolong overdue draft peatlands strategy which would help protect and manage some of the countryrsquos most fragile habitats.The MP said that having watched the huge gorse fires engulf the Mournes, many feared that the days and weeks ahead would be dficult.Having now visited the affected area in the Mournes, Mr Hazzard he was ldquogenuinely shocked at the extent of the devastation.He continued: ldquoMuch of the area is scarred with the charred remains of fragile flora and fauna, with the sickening evidence of the deadly impact of this fire on local wildle plain to see. Local agencies cannot be left alone to pick up the pieces and restore this fragile habitat.ldquoThe environment minister must urgently convene a cross-departmental taskforce that brings together the experience, focus and most importantly, resources, in order to meet the unprecedented challenges in rejuvenating this area.Mr Hazzard said the scenes of environmental destruction left in the Mournes as a result of the inferno show the urgent need to protect precious habitats, especially our peatlands.He added: ldquoIf managed correctly, peatlands play an important role in supporting rich ecosystems, improving water quality and also protecting our communities from the localised consequences of climate change.ldquoFor some time now a draft peatlands strategy has sat with the minister awaiting publication there can be no more delay. Minister Poots must publish this strategy as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the petition urging a ban on the sale of disposal barbecues in shops and supermarkets is gathering increasing support.The resident behind the petition said that every year a number of businesses push the the sale of cheap, disposable barbecues, which are frequently taken to be used in parks and green spaces, often without the landowners permission.ldquoIn many cases, having already scorched the ground below, these barbecues are frequently left, giving rise to wild fires. Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great. These cheap, lightweight disposable barbecues, are not to be socially acceptable any longer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Rosaleen.jpg","title":"Rosaleen praises family on her 100th birthday  ","story":"BORN the day before Northern Ireland came into being  years ago, Rosaleen Rogan celebrated her centenary in style on Sunday.The long and happy le of the devoted parishioner was celebrated at Holy Family Church in Teconnaught with a special Mass dedicated to her by the parish priest, Father Brendan Smyth.The mother-of-five, grandmother to  and great-grandmother to  was greeted by her family and friends staggered throughout the day after the service and at home.Said by her family to ldquostill buzzing on Monday, Mrs Rogan was overwhelmed by the amount of cards, flowers and Mass bouquets given to her to mark her momentous day.As May  in  was recently decreed as the day Northern Ireland was constituted, Mrs Rogan, who lives with her daughter, Mrs Stella Rea in Magheralone, is one of the last surviving Irish-born citizens in Northern Ireland.Her th birthday was recognised by both states with a card from the Queen and a letter from Irish President Michael D Higgins along with a cheque for pound,.Mrs Rogan was also very touched to have been sent a Papal blessing, which was a gt from the parish organised by Fr Smyth, and a letter of congratulations from the Lord Lieutenant of Down, Mr David Lindsay.She was also delighted to receive a visit from family friend and former South Down MP, Baroness Margaret Ritchie who helped the family mark the birthday.Mrs Rogan, who hails from Annacloy, was also joined on Sunday by her two surviving brothers, Joe and Maurice McGrath, with their wives and her sister Marie at the Mass.She is the widow of the late Joe Rogan, a well-known shoemaker and repairer in Drumaness, and often helped him with stitching jobs in the business over the years.The couple shared a devotion to their faith and celebrated  years of marriage on September . Sadly, Mr Rogan died the following March.They had five children mdash Mary Joe, Magdalene, Joe, Imelda and Stella.

They married in September , , and started their long le together, living in Magheralone and the Four Roads in Drumaness.When asked how she accounts for her long le, Mrs Rogan replied: ldquoHard work, good company and a loving family. It was all down to the Lord, it was nothing that I did.One of the highlights of her le was when she was honoured in September , by being invited to Knock Shrineas a special guest of honour to meet the new Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Jude Thaddeus Okolo.Mrs Rogan was selected as someone who dedicated her le to prayer. She and her daughters, Mary Joe Walker, Imelda Savage and Stella Rea, marked the annual pilgrimage to Knock as one of the most important dates in the year. She was also presented with a certicate during Mass as the oldest grandparent there that day.Mrs Rogan is a famed seamstress and her family say that there is nothing she canrsquot turn her hand to, and shersquos still sought out to help them with the odd stitching job.Mrs Rea adds: ldquoIf therersquos a particularly dficult tear, the saying usually is you may ask Granny Rogan. She also took up knitting again during the lockdown and knits squares for prayer blankets.ldquoMummy used to go to thelocal bingo many many years ago with her friends and neighbours but still enjoys a game with family around the kitchen table.ldquoEvery Easter she joins the grandchildren and great grandchildren painting the eggs to get ready for rolling.Mrs Rogan loved working outdoors and was a keen gardener. Today she enjoys the lively company of her great-grandchildren and has also got comfortable with technology, video-calling other family members who are not at home and watching Mass at Holy Family Church online.Her family hope to have her attending Mass every Sunday as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Kevin.jpg","title":"St Kevin’s Camogie Club now a reality  ","story":"A NEW camogie club has been formed in East Down.St Kevinrsquos Camogie Club is the result of the coming together of Teconnaught GAC and Drumaness GAC, which both have strong camogie traditions.The two clubs share a sporting history mdash many years ago they united to form a football team also titled St Kevinrsquos.The exciting new venture materialised after a conversation between chairperson Maria Ryan, who hails all the way from Silvermines in Co Tipperary, but now lives in Teconnaught, and vice-chair Cathy Mason, a Drumaness native, about keeping the tradition of camogie alive.ldquoAfter endless conversations with Teconnaught chairman Barry Carville over the years, he brought it to the Teconnaught committeersquos attention, said Maria.ldquoOnce he did this, word got out about the interest of camogie around the community. This is what led to a conversation with Cathy, who had a shared love and passion for the sport, she continued.ldquoWe both agreed it would be amazingwe could bring young girls together to play camogie. The success of St. Kevinrsquos would not have been possible without the drive from both parishes.The newly formed committee is made up of a number of associated members from both clubs, who all share the same common goal of teaching camogie to as many girls as possible whilst ensuring a longevity to develop and establish the club.Cathy said it was ldquoan absolute honour to play a part in the creation of St Kevinrsquos.ldquoAs a Drumaness Gael I know that a very special lady, Annie Gelston, a Drumaness camogie legend, will be looking down with pride, said Mason.ldquoI would like to say a special word of thanks to the Drumaness and Teconnaught clubs for their unwavering support over the past few weeks, not only in the initial set-up but also with use of their pitches and facilities.The club held their first training session together at the Teconnaught club grounds on Saturday and it was evident that there is a potential successful future ahead based on the turnout of participants.ldquoTherersquos not many times in my le Irsquove been lost for words, but describing my emotions and feelings of Saturday is definitely one of them, said Maria.ldquoWe had over  girls show up for our first training session, over  in our senior ladies and U- session and over  in our sessions for the younger girls, she added.Cathy also reflected on the historic first training session, describing it as a ldquospecial moment as she watched the ldquomany smiles on the faces of the young children having fun and hopefully falling in love with the wonderful sport of camogie.Since many of the girls in all of the age groups had never attended a camogie training session before, the highly experienced coaches, who have backgrounds in both hurling and camogie, began teaching the basics to get them familiar with holding a hurley and making contact with the sliotar.Several dferent training drills were also incorporated to get the new recruits comfortable on the pitch.ldquoIt is very important to me and the coaches that we made this past Saturday and all future sessions a positive experience for the girls, said Maria.ldquoSo many of them took to it so naturally and we canrsquot wait to see how they progress over the season.St Kevinrsquos now eagerly look ahead to their first match against Ballela on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12579301.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That controlling impulse is in place in this current election for the DUP leadership. Candidates for the top position have been banned from doing interviews during the contest.This is not only an unreasonable bar, it is an unwise one for the DUP. It will make it easier for the party to select a replacement to Arlene Foster who has avoided saying something they later regret, or indeed that the whole DUP regrets. But it means the candidates cannot be grilled their thinking.This is problematic at any time, but above all now. For example, yesterday Mrs Foster attended a North South meeting, again raising doubt as to DUP policy on such meetings.And the latest troubling development on legacy, relating to the RUC , coming a day after the disturbing case around the killing of the IRA terrorist Joe McCann collapsed, means that we do need to know what the DUP believes about how to proceed legacy.Opacity will not help the party. It will merely, for example, lead people to assume that the DUP is going to take a positiononly later to be disappointedno such action is forthcoming.It would be better for the key positions of the two candidates to be made clear to both the DUP and the wider population before they are chosen.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They need to spell it out very clearly.“I’ve been shouting quite loud at the committee that we need a really consistently clear articulation in relation to these issues.”He said many people who have loved-ones in care homes have not got the time – or perhaps even the ability – to read through  pages of documentation.“You think that after a year-long of this nonsense, the department would realise they need to have clear, consistent guidance...“Sadly these latest documents show they just haven’t learned the lesson.”Perhaps the main changes kicking in tomorrow which the News Letter has gleanedis that the number of visits allowed per week will be upped from one to two– with the new guidance stating that such visits should be “accessible over a seven-day period as well as after pm”.These visits will be capped at two people at one time , for one hour.Handwashing will replace the use of gloves to enable handholding, but aprons and masks will remain. In addition to the two visits allowed above, church ministers and faith groups may book a visit. All visitors are to be screened for Covid-.This will be followed by another set of relaxations four weeks later.Read more from this reporter at the links below: Click here – Sinn Fein man: NI state’s law was the envy of racist apartheid regime  Click here – NI centenary celebrations ‘a far cry from Republic of Ireland extravaganza’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySharon Peacock, head of the Covid- Genomics UK Consortiumand professor of public health and microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said it could be the case that coronavirus mutates to become less infectious, though she warned it could take years for it to become like the common cold.Asked whether a iant will emerge somewhere across the globe that is resistant to current vaccines, Prof Peacock told Times Radio: ldquoThatrsquos what wersquod call it, a iant of major concern. We havenrsquot seen anything like that to date, and the question yoursquore asking is the million dollar question in many ways, everybody wants to know whatrsquos the likelihood and when is it likely to occur,at all.ldquoWhat we donrsquot know isit is likely to occur. We know that as mutations accumulate in the virus, it can actually make it more fit in terms of avoiding our immune system, but the more mutations it accumulates, it could actually lead to a virus that is less infectious, for example. vw,vw,px, px\"Scientists say that none of the known Covid iants can fully evade current vaccines ldquoSo therersquos a trade-off for the virus in terms of how many mutations it can tolerate.ldquoNow, some people have predicted that a virus could emerge that is pretty resistant to vaccines, but we havenrsquot seen any hint of that at the moment.ldquoAnd the idea that this could arise is based on models from previous viruses, not this current one, so at the moment, I remain optimistic that wersquore in a good place ndash that the viruses that are circulating are susceptible to vaccinations.ldquoAnd the key thing is to get on and vaccinate the world so that we can clamp down [on] disease. If we can reduce disease rates, then we reduce the risk of iants arising in the first place.Prof Peacock said work was ongoing to look at the iant first identied in India, including whether it could spread in the UK compared to the Kent iant.     The Indian government has said the coronavirus iant first discovered there in March may be linked to its deadly second wave.Samples for the B.. iant have been found in several states with high case numbers, it said.The National Centre for Disease Control said, however, that it had still been unable to fully establish a correlation.Asked about the iant, which has been found in a small number of cases in the UK and is currently regarded as a iant under investigation, Prof Peacock said: ldquoMy eyes are constantly now looking at the pattern of spread within the United Kingdom to see whether this iant is able to spread in our population under current restrictions.ldquoTherersquos no evidence at the moment that the iant described in India, which we call B.., is resistant to the vaccine, far more work needs to be done.ldquoVery early work suggests that itrsquos not as resistant as, say, the iant first described in South Africa.ldquoBut what we donrsquot know about this particular iant from India is how transmissible it is, so thatrsquos the other key question.ldquoThe big question for me, is whether the Indian iant is also particularly transmissible.ldquoNow we can see that through experimental work, but the key is to watch it in the population, to see whether itrsquos associated with outbreaks and spread in the community.ldquoI know that Public Health England are really looking very carefully at that because thatrsquos a sign that under the circumstances wersquore under in terms of our current restrictions, whether that is spreading is a key signal ndash a public health signal of transmissibility.ldquoWersquod obviously have to prove that scientically, but thatrsquos a really key thing to watch out for. vw,vw,px, px\"Prof Peacock suggested richer nations should be doing all they can to help vaccinate people in poorer countries.She said: ldquoWe in wealthy countries should be thinking about people who are less fortunate than ourselves, and added: ldquoWe should be vaccinating the world on a moral standpoint, but also vaccinating the world to try and reduce the rate of infection, so that we protect people from an untimely death, but also reduce the risk of iants emerging in the first place, because ultimately in the long-term, that is one of the major threats to us controlling this pandemic.Asked whether Covid will become like annual seasonal flu, she said: ldquoThe idea that the virus will become like a common cold and nobody will notice it by next spring is far too optimistic.ldquoAnd so it could take one or two generations before we see a virus that starts to, what we say attenuate, which means it causes less severe disease, and so, I think, what we have to do is tackle the problem thatrsquos in front of us at the moment and not put too much store in the fact that the virus is going to evolve into something thatrsquos really rather harmless.ldquoThatrsquos been seen for other viruses, but thatrsquos over a process of decades and hundreds of years, and wersquore talking about being in the very early stages, [we] still have a pandemic, so we canrsquot guarantee that thatrsquos the trajectory of the virus right now.The comments come as Canada became the first country to authorise a vaccine for children aged  to .It authorised Pfizer after studies showed the jab worked well in that age group..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: No hint that Covid iants can fully evade vaccines, says scientist article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe European Commission complained the authorities were imposing ldquoadditional conditions on French fishing boats operating there, in breach of the terms of the agreement hammered out on Christmas Eve.But in a call with Jerseyrsquos chief minister John Le Fondre, Boris Johnson again voiced his ldquounequivocal support for the actions taken by the islandrsquos government.He said two Royal Navy patrol boats despatched to the area on Wednesday would remain in place as a ldquoprecautionary measure.Around  French fishing boats gathered off the islandrsquos main port St Helier early on Thursday to protest against the new licences they have been required to obtain from the Jersey government to carry on operating.Local fishermen reported flares were let off and that some boats entered the harbour for around an hour, with footage posted online apparently showing a French boat ramming the rear of a Jersey vessel.The French maritime authority for the Channel sent a pair of police patrol boats to the area ldquoto ensure the protection of human le at sea. vw,vw,px, px\"The protest leaders denied they were seeking to impose a blockade and the flotilla eventually headed back to France.In an attempt to defuse the row, representatives of the Jersey government met the fishermen, with their boat pulling alongside one of the French vessels so they could talk ship-to-ship while observing Covid restrictions.External relations minister Ian Gorst said the discussions were ldquopositive but some of the fishermen were reported to be unhappy, complaining there had been little progress.The row erupted after the Jersey government said French boats would be required to obtain licences to carry on fishing in the islandrsquos waters under the terms of the trade deal with the EU which came into force last Friday.      vw,vw,px, px\"French fishing vessels outside the harbour at St Helier The move provoked a wave of anger among French fishing communities who complained that boats which had operated there for years were suddenly having their access restricted, because they could not prove their historical links with the waters.In Brussels, a spokeswoman for the European Commission said ldquoadditional conditions attached to the new licences represented a breach of the trade deal.She said they had ldquoindicated to the UK that we see that the provisions of the EU UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, that we recently agreed, have not been met there, have not been respected.Mr Gorst said the Jersey authorities were ldquoextremely grateful to the UK Government for its prompt deployment of the patrol boats HMS Severn and HMS Tamar following warnings French fishing boats could try to mount a blockade. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson has said HMS Tamar will remain as a lsquoprecautionary measurersquo However he insisted that they wanted to find a diplomatic solution to de-escalate the situation.ldquoItrsquos important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy, he told BBC News.Earlier this week, French maritime minister Annick Girardin said Paris would cut off electricity to Jersey ndash which gets % of its power supply from France ndashthe dispute was not resolved.The Jersey government has said that of the  French boats that applied for licences last Friday,  had been unable to provide the evidence needed to enable them to carry on as before.Mr Gorst said: ldquoItrsquos really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that,required, their licences can be amended. vw,vw,px, px\"External Relations Minister Ian Gorst has said Jersey wants a diplomatic solution Nevertheless, there was concern on the island that the French action could escalatethe dispute was not resolved.Fisherman Josh Dearing said the appearance of the French boats had been ldquolike an invasion, and welcomed the presence of the Royal Navy ships.ldquoWersquore completely unprotected in Jersey. Wersquove got nothing except for a few police officers. We donrsquot have a police boat, we donrsquot have a navy boat, we donrsquot have anything to protect us, he told the PA news agency.ldquoThe French can be hostile.
