Caribbean sun last January, he smugly told his host: \u0027Life is perfect.\u0027 Soon after, Covid brought the world crashing down.Buffeted by unforeseen disasters and relying on the advice of improvising scientists, Boris refused to abandon his winning demeanour. Rather than preach doom and gloom, he spouted unsubstantiated optimism to reassure Britons – and maintain his popularity. As the nation\u0027s confidence drained away, Boris\u0027s inconsistency inevitably fuelled accusations of him betraying the nation\u0027s trust.Repeatedly, his promises were exposed as phoney.In truth, some of those promises were not lies but just impulsive expressions of hopefulness and a wordsmith\u0027s hyperbole.Eventually, Britain did develop the world\u0027s biggest \u0027test and trace\u0027 scheme and now appears on course to be the first European nation to deliver mass vaccinations.And contrary to the BBC\u0027s constant damnation of Boris\u0027s reaction to Covid, while praising the response in Germany and Sweden, it now seems that the BBC\u0027s judgment was characteristically partisan. In the second wave of the virus, death rates in Germany and Sweden have been soaring.Ever The Gambler, though, Boris seems congenitally unable to shake off the temptation to utter optimistic predictions.Another Achilles heel is his cronyism, which begs questions about his integrity.Justifiably frustrated by intransigent or incompetent civil servants, he has rightly appointed trusted Tories to key positions.Some, such as Dido Harding, put in charge of \u0027test and trace\u0027, have proved vulnerable. Another Tory MP\u0027s wife, Kate Bingham, as vaccines tsar, though, has played aces, along with several others.As for some of the PM\u0027s nominations to peerages, frankly, they stink. Although Boris\u0027s cronyism is as nothing compared with Tony Blair, who was questioned three times in Downing Street by Scotland Yard detectives during their investigation of the Labour Party\u0027s so-called \u0027sale of peerages\u0027.And some of Harold Wilson\u0027s peers were jailed.The fact is that a brazen Boris, with just under four years until the next General Election, doesn\u0027t care a fig about his Westminster critics. His gamble is that few Tory voters will remember in 2024. According to psychologists, all gamblers eventually lose. But that is not true.In my biographies of powerful men, I have chronicled how Bernie Ecclestone, Jimmy Goldsmith, Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell and Richard Branson risked their fortunes on outlandish deals – and won.That is the nature of successful tycoons: assessing the risk, judging their opponent, controlling the bank and making the bet.Boris\u0027s critics claim his gambles are different because he takes risks with other people\u0027s money.However, they forget that tycoons risk their shareholders\u0027 and bankers\u0027 money. It was by staying at the top of the greasy pole that vindicated those gamblers\u0027 skill to judge the risk.Over the past weeks, Boris Johnson has reduced his risks. To survive, he abruptly approved the resignations of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain. Their replacement by competent traditionalists proved that The Gambler had learnt his lessons.The Boris Rollercoaster is now slowing down. By the spring, most of Britain\u0027s vulnerable population will have been vaccinated. Life should start to return to normal, despite the country\u0027s gargantuan debts. With low interest rates and the right leadership from Downing Street, Britons could seize their new liberty and revive the country\u0027s fortunes.Sports fans will pack back into stadia, the young will crowd into clubs and rock concerts, children will gleefully return to school, actors and musicians will entertain us in theatres and concert halls, and entrepreneurs will reopen pubs and restaurants.The darkness will be over. And The Gambler will stretch out and take his winnings.l Tom Bower is author of Boris Johnson, The Gambler"},{"url":null,"title":"MAIL SUNDAY COMMENT Boris human bulldozer triumphantly freed EU","story":"Share this article Others deserve great credit, especially chief negotiator Lord Frost, an astute bargainer who refused to concede the initiative, and turned his negotiators into a united, determined team. They affirmed their solidarity by wearing Union Jack badges in the talks and so signalled to their opposite numbers that they were the representatives of a sovereign nation, immovable from their settled purpose. In a time when so many acquire titles and decorations for little or nothing, it is good to see someone honoured who truly deserves it. His colleague Oliver ‘Sonic’ Lewis also deserves much credit, for fighting off key EU demands with great technical skill.Now the abiding question is what this country does with the vast and significant freedoms it has regained at such cost and after such a long struggle. Of course it will be good to have our own sovereign Parliament and courts again, and not to be compelled to fly the flag of another power at our embassies abroad. But the hard practical liberty that this has given to our economy will be the most immediate effect.Our entrepreneurial spirit has always been great – look at the determination of our small businesses, which even during the miseries of lockdown have used every inch of available freedom to stay above water, turning inventively to ‘click and collect’ and takeaway services to keep themselves in business.Enterprise, large and small, is something we know how to do at home and abroad, and it is how we will pay for our future – and sustain and expand our freedom and prosperity in these uncertain times.Which is why Mr Johnson needs to turn his determination and attention to another fight for freedom – the battle to release us from shutdown and restriction. These restrictions, costly, miserable and a drag on the enterprise we need so much, must end soon. If they do not, they will be harder and harder to enforce and will do less and less good.And there is one way out, through the anti-Covid vaccines that this country has developed and pioneered. Significantly we are already vaccinating by the tens of thousands while the sclerotic EU (held as always to the speed of the slowest by its cumbersome rules) has hardly begun to get going on its inoculation programme.Our immunisation campaign can, and must, now be reinforced and accelerated, so that in the cming few months we protect the vulnerable in their millions. By targeting those groups in society who are most at risk from the coronavirus, we can enormously reduce the danger that our hospitals will be hit by a concentrated wave of dangerous infections.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is likely to be approved imminently and come on stream alongside the Pfizer jab, greatly increasing the number who can be treated. If this is pursued with proper energy, it will not be long before the main argument for shutdown – the need to protect the NHS against being overwhelmed – will simply cease to apply.And just imagine the delight, relief and pure joy as the loathed trappings of lockdown, from screens and masks to the relentless badgering of health propaganda, are laid aside, our stifled freedoms to live normally, to hug and be hugged, to mix freely, to entertain and be entertained, to leave our homes without restriction, are restored – and we put this miserable era of fear and apprehension behind us.This is, after all, a time of year when we are supposed to be hopeful. We have, on this occasion, justified reasons for hope and they have come together in one good moment.Not only have we at last undone what most now recognise to have been a historic mistake – the discredited and outdated 1960s belief that, having lost an empire, we needed to dissolve ourselves in the Brussels superstate.As for the virus, we are also on the brink of escaping from its bonds, having borne it with patience and stoicism but now facing restrictions which grow daily more oppressive and intolerable.Boris Johnson has shown that he can shoulder his way through obstacles that others thought could not be shifted or bypassed – through Labour’s vaunted ‘Red Wall’ of supposedly impregnable parliamentary seats through the EU’s refusal to believe that anyone would actually have the nerve to refuse its sticky embrace.And now he can do the same to the Covid misery. In the strong hope that he will swiftly and resolutely do so, once again brushing aside naysayers, pessimists and doubters, we wish both him and you, our readers, a happy, liberated New Year, free of oppressions and limits, from whatever direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c27a5f37fd7c66ac74e75b75b42fbebd72771b32/123_183_786_471/master/786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a6fca8c8b9ebbda088f0b40fc38cf4","title":"2020 visions daily drawings of a very strange year in pictures","story":"Since Boris Johnson won the general election in December 2019, London-based artist Jolie Goodman has been making a daily digital drawing for her series 1872 days of Tory Government (which would be the length of a full five-year term).

In a normal trading year, stores would have concentrated on selling as much full-price stock as possible in their peak pre-Christmas trade.There have been higher levels of promotional activity than usual this year, peaking around Black Friday, according to data from PricewaterhouseCoopers.Overall, retailers have offered shoppers more targeted discounts than in previous years, to encourage them to spend, according to PwC, as opposed to blanket discounts that are valid for all products.“Retailers are learning to use their approach to promotions more effectively, and this year it’s important that they hold on to as much margin as possible,” said Lisa Hooker, the consumer markets lead at PwC.Lockdowns and the temporary closure of non-essential stores in all home nations of the UK may be responsible for some discounting, according to Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics.“Lots of retailers had all of their stock and inventory in a number of stores which were closed, they missed out on these precious, vital weeks running up to Christmas,” Lim said. “At such short notice, many of them couldn’t suddenly start shipping out online orders from stores. A lot of retailers were heading into the December period with a lot more stock than they would usually have at this time of year.”The pandemic has created winners and losers within the retail industry, and led to erging approaches to pre-Christmas discounting. Furniture retailers have struggled to keep up with demand for homeware, allowing them to be more sparing with their reductions.The UK market leader, DFS Furniture, which trades from stores branded DFS, Sofa Workshop, Dwell and Sofology, told investors in mid-December that soaring sales had led to longer lead times for its made-to-order sofas.It has been a different story for fashion retailers, however, who have faced a toxic cocktail of challenges during 2020 – the widespread cancellation of events and special occasions, the months-long closure of stores, and the continued closure of changing rooms.With nowhere to go, shoppers never bothered to get dressed up. They spurned suits and stilettos in favour of slippers and sweatpants. As a result, clothing stores have been the clear outlier in the run-up to Christmas, offering promotions on all items to try to clear their stock.Some of the biggest reductions are available at shops that are in administration – including the collapsed department store Debenhams and the Arcadia brands such as Topshop – as the firms’ administrators look to swiftly raise cash.Such swingeing discounting creates problems for competitors who might have hoped to hold off reductions until after Christmas.John Lewis, which still has its “never knowingly unsold” promise to match prices at its direct competitors, has been obliged to follow some of Debenhams’s discounts.This Christmas may turn out to be a “last gasp” for large-scale retail purchases, according to Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of the retail marketing agency Savvy.“This year is the year of things,” she said. “If everything has returned to normal next year thanks to a vaccine, next Christmas will be more about experiences and spending time with people.”Retail analysts also caution that consumers should not necessarily expect this most unusual year to set a trend for future pre-Christmas reductions. With difficult trading conditions set to continue along with a squeeze on consumer spending, some of the retailers desperately slashing prices may not be around to see next Christmas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc2cb6bb9f6ba28255c3f55b088b20cf6a5b40c/0_0_7834_4702/master/7834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36ab9336031ecf0968ae2adda769e323","title":"uk financial firms boards pay directors","story":"Shareholder advisers and high pay campaigners call for greater transparency on director feesData gathered by the  shows median pay for the three highest earning non-executive directors (NEDs) in each of the FTSE 100’s 17 financial firms surged from £90,700 in 2009 to £162,000 in 2019.Headhunters said the rise was partly due to strict regulations introduced after the financial crisis, which meant NEDs had to keep closer tabs on operations, and take greater responsibility when things went wrong.However, there is no precedent for UK NEDs having their pay docked for company misconduct. The insurance company Aviva is considering clawing back director pay after a row over how it announced a plan to cancel its preference shares in 2018, but blame for corporate failures has historically been laid at the feet of company executives.It is also difficult to confirm directors’ workloads beyond what is disclosed in annual reports. Data suggests the highest-paid NEDs were attending just five more committee and board meetings a year in 2019 than they did in 2009, with the median number of meetings now sitting at 26 compared with 21 a decade earlier. The busiest among them sat through 48 meetings last year.Reacting to the  research, the High Pay Centre thinktank and influential shareholder adviser PIRC called for more detailed information about top earners like NEDs, whose ballooning fees have flown under the radar over the past decade.“On balance, NED pay should require greater scrutiny, expecting the same rigour as executive pay and linked to demonstrable peer-group benchmarking in terms of fees, workload and meetings and items discussed,” said Francesco Navarrini, PIRC’s head of research.He said companies should consider the pay ratio between NEDs and a company’s rank-and-file employees when considering further pay rises.NEDs at financial firms could face greater pressure over fee transparency, since they are earning significantly more than their UK peers. On average, NEDs at financial firms are now earning £210,019 a year, which is more than double the average £99,139 earned by NEDs across all of the UK’s 150 largest listed firms, according to separate figures gathered by headhunter Spencer Stuart, which did not include median pay. While the median captures the middle of the range, the mean or average captures the typical figure when iding fees equally between the entire group.Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “Paying out such lucrative sums for part-time work does create a damaging public perception of directorships and the way businesses are run, and potentially attracts people to the roles for the wrong reasons.”“Pay for high earners, particularly in financial services, amounts to a significant cost for businesses, and there should probably be more detailed disclosure requirements on what companies are spending on those making six figures and upwards,” he added.While none of the financial company NEDs from 2009 are still in their post – owing to a nine-year-limit – many serving on financial services boards have seen their fees double or triple during their tenure.While a handful of NEDs included in the data do hold additional non-executive roles within their businesses like Dangeard and Miller, not all firms will disclose how much they are paid for each position, strengthening the argument for further transparency and more rigorous standards around NED fees.Jenni Hibbert, a global managing partner at executive search firm Heidrick and Struggles, said directors put in more time than is disclosed in company reports. She estimated that NEDs for complex, FTSE 100 financial firms will usually be putting in about 80 to 100 days a year, including time spent preparing for meetings and getting to know the business.“We have to remember that being a NED is a huge responsibility – the Companies Act does not differentiate between an executive and a non-executive director when it comes to fiduciary responsibilities,” Hibbert said.“An NED is therefore required to take the same level of care as an executive, and they cannot do this by just turning up to board meetings – it takes many hours of reading, investigating and getting under the skin of things, to do their job well.”But with roughly 250 working days a year, NEDs are still working part-time while earning significantly more than most employees within the business.“Many financial services firms paying six-figure sums to their NEDs will also have low-paid staff in branches, call centres or administrative roles struggling to make ends meet,” Hildyard said.“The UK should be debating what we could do more generally to achieve a more even income distribution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9075cbd518b8e7c4e036f283f867d7ab25df4d92/0_225_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=765588ff215452aa2a3daab0ccf48239","title":"the observer view on the brexit deal","story":"Any deal is better than no deal. But the agreement that Boris Johnson struck with the European Union on Christmas Eve is no political triumph, no diplomatic feat. It will one day surely be regarded as one of the greatest-ever deceits inflicted on the British electorate. We were told that a free trade agreement with the EU would be “one of the easiest in human history” to get, that we were “going to get a great deal”. We were told that a free trade agreement would give us “the exact same benefits” of EU membership without any of the obligations or financial costs.Yet the deal Johnson has reached will inflict all the costs he denied it ever would. It will take some weeks to fully digest the many pages of legal text. But it is already clear that this deal will have enduring consequences for Britain in the coming decades: for the wellbeing and resilience of communities across a highly unequal nation for the potential for the UK to be an influence for good in an increasingly unstable world and perhaps even for the very integrity of our nation. Johnson’s act of national harm could not come at a worse time. It will set in train significant economic damage during a global pandemic that has left the NHS and economy reeling.That we have ended up here is no great surprise. It was always in the interests of both sides to reach a deal before this week’s hard deadline. But no number of bombastic speeches from Johnson can disguise that the realpolitik of negotiation finally forced him to grapple with Brexit’s fundamental tradeoffs. The man who has spent years telling voters Britain can gorge itself on cake now and forever has agreed to pay a serious price.But, as we wrote in 2016, the EU was always much more than an economic project. It was an idealistic undertaking to prevent the continent ever again being wracked by war. Decades later, we live in a world marked by new types of instability. The biggest global challenges we face – the climate crisis, global pandemics, international tax avoidance on an eyewatering scale – can be tackled only through nation states acting in concert, rather than alone.This, together with the fact that we live in a globalised world where the most successful countries choose regulatory alignment in order to facilitate trade, puts paid to the isolationist and old-fashioned notions of national sovereignty trumpeted by the small-minded politics of the Leave campaign. The EU is not flawless – no union of 28 nations could be anything but imperfect – and it faces existential challenges of its own. But the world is a better place for it, and it is a cause for great sadness that the UK is turning its back on what it represents. Britain has not been dragged along as a reluctant passenger: from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair, generation after generation of politicians have shaped the EU from the inside. This deal will diminish the UK’s global influence not just from the perspective of our national interest but in terms of our wider international responsibilities as one of the world’s richest liberal democracies.It is the internal politics of the Conservative party that made this type of hard Brexit inevitable. The vote to leave the EU could have paved the way for a softer Brexit that kept the UK in the single market and customs union. The British public is far more pragmatic than the right of the Conservative party: a citizens’ assembly in 2017 suggested that people were prepared to accept free movement of people in order to minimise the economic costs of Brexit. A responsible prime minister would have sought to unify the country by pursuing the least isive form of Brexit.Instead, the country has been governed by a party captured by an unholy alliance of populists and hard-right ideologues. The Vote Leave campaign misled the public by spreading racist dogwhistles about immigration and by misusing official statistics to promise that Brexit would deliver a huge boost to the NHS. These lies were endorsed by politicians like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who both surely knew that an honest case for Brexit was not strong enough to win a popular vote. The lesson of populism through the ages is that pretending there are easy solutions to voters’ discontents, and identifying, then marginalising scapegoats for our problems, makes winning easier – if more dishonourable.Rather than confront the public with the truth that some of the sharpest geographical inequalities in Europe, and the lack of jobs and opportunity in parts of the country, would require real and sustained investment to address, Tory Leavers made out that Brexit was the answer, while at the same time supporting drastic cuts in government support to those very areas. In the past five years, crass sloganeering has substituted for responsible government. A unifying, soft Brexit was never on offer: May’s withdrawal agreement could never bind a successor in charge of a final deal. As it turns out, Johnson, the actual successor, has proved willing to break international law, let alone agreements with opposition MPs. If a more effective leader than Jeremy Corbyn had been at the helm of the Labour party, perhaps things could have been different. But a politically dominant Conservative party led by prime ministers in hock to the European Research Group has led us inexorably towards this hard Brexit.We will live with the consequences for decades. The economic cost is not some theoretical number: it will translate into greater hardship and fewer opportunities in areas that can least afford to bear it. It will make the urgent task of reducing the UK’s stark regional inequalities much harder. Forgive our scepticism that a Conservative government that has slashed support for low-paid parents by thousands of pounds a year, and has forced the least affluent areas to cope with the biggest cuts to public services, will do what is needed.Any gains to a dated notion of sovereignty will come at great cost to people’s personal freedoms: to make a life, to study, to start a business or to fall in love in another country. It is a myth that these freedoms were only ever exercised by a privileged group of voters. The irony is that some of the wealthiest backers of Brexit have found ways of hanging on to them even as they expect the rest of us to give them up.This hard Brexit will also deepen rifts within the union. Most immediately, it will give succour to the cause of Scottish independence. The Scots did not vote for Brexit and do not want it. Johnson is unpopular in Scotland, and support for independence is growing. And it is far from certain what the long-term consequences of this deal will be for Northern Ireland. The deal at least removes the need for a border in Ireland, but at the cost of a border in the Irish Sea. It disturbs the fragile political balance that the Good Friday agreement achieved and creates an uncertain future for the power-sharing arrangements that were critical to ending a bloody, decades-long conflict.The hope will be that this deal might at least herald the beginning of a more responsible politics in the UK that it might form the basis for a return to government in the national interest, and the repair of relationships that have been damaged by the petty, childish diplomacy of the past few years. But the reality is that we are in for at least a few more years where internal Conservative party battles continue to dominate. Despite his majority, Johnson is a weak leader lacking in principles and vision. There is now likely to be an almighty struggle between those on the right of his party who always saw Brexit as the route to slashing taxes, regulatory standards and consumer protections, and those who recognise the human costs this would involve.This deal will at least one day form the basis for a more visionary prime minister to rebuild what Johnson has forced the UK to voluntarily surrender. One day, our children and grandchildren will look back in astonishment that Britain’s governing class managed to fail the country so comprehensively. One day, politicians will feel embarrassed to admit their association with the tawdry politics of Brexit.For now, we are consigned to government by an incompetent and unscrupulous gaggle of politicians. They will continue to wreak damage our country can ill afford. But in the wake of their eventual defeat there surely lies a better, brighter future for Britain that will one day come to pass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61bfbbca9f177cb389969a8f30146a09b1eba32/0_116_2686_1612/master/2686.jpg?width=1125\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e570ac70c8d10134e9e330b2064ad70 1125w","title":"deb haaland interview interior secretary native americans","story":"The 60-year-old congresswoman will be the first Native American cabinet secretary next month when she takes over at interiorThe 60-year-old congresswoman from New Mexico will next month become the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, when she takes responsibility for the country’s land and natural resources as head of the Department of the Interior under Joe Biden.Come January it will also be Haaland’s job to uphold the government’s legally binding obligations to the tribes – treaty obligations which have been systematically violated with devastating consequences for life expectancy, political participation and economic opportunities in Indian Country.In an interview days before her nomination, Haaland told the  that as secretary of the interior she would “move climate change priorities, tribal consultation and a green economic recovery forward”.It’s a big job with high expectations after four years of racist rhetoric and destructive environmental rollbacks by the Trump administration, which showed contempt for the climate or environment by green-lighting planet-heating fossil fuel projects on public and tribal lands with little regard for culturally and ecologically important sites.“I’ll be fierce for all of us, for our planet, and all of our protected land,” said Haaland in her acceptance speech. “This moment is profound when we consider the fact that a former secretary of the interior once proclaimed it his goal to, quote, ‘civilize or exterminate’ us. I’m a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology.”Indigenous communities in the US, and globally, are disproportionately vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis such as rising sea levels and droughts, and environmental hazards resulting from polluting industries. As secretary of the interior, Haaland will play a key role in undoing Trump’s rollbacks and will also be a key lieutenant in Biden’s new climate team.This is not the first time Haaland has made history. In 2018, she became one of the first two Native women in Congress, alongside Sharice Davids of Kansas. In January, a record-breaking six Native Americans – four Democrats and two Republicans – will be sworn in.Representation and ersity matter, according to Haaland, because life experiences shape political decisions. “We don’t need people who all have the same perspective, we need people from various parts of the country, who’ve been raised in different ways, who bring that history and culture with them, and employ what we’ve learnt from their parents and grandparents, and bring all of that to bear in the decisions that we make,” she told the .It’s been a rocky road for Haaland who like a disproportionate number of Native Americans has experienced homelessness and relied on food stamps. She is also the product of racist policies such as the forced removal of thousands of Native children from their families between 1860 and 1978. At the age of eight, Haaland’s grandmother was sent to a Catholic boarding school for five years a hundred miles from home.“There are a lot of people in this country who suffered historical trauma from that era. I carry that history with me, I’m a product of the assimilation policy of the United States. I feel very strongly that having this perspective is super important for the issues we bring to Congress.”Haaland was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 after campaigning under the slogan: “Congress has never heard a voice like mine.” Since then, she has introduced legislation that would establish a truth commission on Native American boarding schools and spearheaded two laws to combat the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women – crimes increasingly linked to transient extractive industry workers living in so-called man camps near or on tribal lands.“Indigenous women have been missing and murdered since Europeans came to this continent in the late 1400s. Violence against women is a priority of mine. It’s not going to be fixed with just two pieces of legislation, but now it’s time to dig deeper and keep working,” she said.Haaland will be the most senior Native American in the US government since the Republican Charles Curtis, a member of the Kaw nation situated in what is now Kansas, who served as vice-president to Herbert Hoover between 1929 and 1933.She will be part of a government facing unprecedented complex and interconnected challenges including an out-of-control pandemic, global economic recession, spiralling hunger and the climate emergency.Haaland’s track record working across partisan lines may also prove vital for Biden’s success, at a time when the country – and lawmakers – are deeply ided.She said: “I’ve gotten more Republicans to sign on to my bills than any other Democrat. It’s important for all of us – county commissioners, governors and mayors, not just Congress – to make sure we’re working together for the greater good. We want to pass laws that will help people across the country, and we need to make sure these messages are getting out … I’m going to continue to reach across the aisle, to protect our environment and make sure that vulnerable communities have a say in what our country is doing moving forward.”The Department of the Interior’s 70,000 or so staff oversee one-fifth of all the land in the US and 1.7bn acres of coastlines, as well as managing national parks, wildlife refuges and natural resources such as gas, oil and water.A shift in priorities at the interior department could have major implications for global heating as about one-quarter of all US carbon emissions come from fossil fuels extracted on public lands, according to the US Geological Survey.“Environmental injustice and economic injustice have taken a hold of so many communities, and they’ve had enough. They want us to pay attention and help them to succeed … As far as Indian Country is concerned, I want to make sure tribal leaders – and all marginalized communities – have a seat at the table.”Restoring protections eroded by Trump for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante – national monuments in southern Utah which are sacred to Native Americans, is a priority for Haaland.November’s elections took place after a summer of unprecedented protests demanding racial justice sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who was killed by a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes.Progressive Democrats, including Haaland and the so-called Squad – made up of congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib - elevated demands by protesters for radical structural changes to eradicate racial inequalities in health, housing, immigration, education, jobs and the environment.“So many Native Americans joined the Black Lives Matter protests because Indian Country recognised that we are allies in the fight for environmental justice, economic justice and racial justice … These communities on the frontline deserve to have the resources to be able to lift themselves up,” Haaland said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/334a2f720bb117883d65f8862cc7bfec394dfc31/130_0_2343_1406/master/2343.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=98d6afffcb2cb609a0451c01e548e34a","title":"manchester city newcastle premier league match report","story":"Manchester City remain in search of the relentlessness of their title triumphs under Pep Guardiola but this scrappy win still moves them into fifth.Missing is a killer touch before goal, with Sergio Agüero being nursed back to full fitness. Newcastle were routed here last season and would have been again if Ferran Torres and Raheem Sterling, in particular, had been cooler-eyed finishers.If there was profligacy in front of goal, Guardiola was effusive about the tempo. “This was the best game of the season for players being in the position they have to be in – our football has to be in the right rhythm and today was a big example,” he said.Kyle Walker’s positive coronavirus test enforced Guardiola to draft in Nathan Aké, his sole change from last Saturday’s 1-0 win at Southampton, while Steve Bruce hoped for a far better display than the one that led to Newcastle being knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Brentford in midweek.The contest kicked off in driving rain and as is often the case City soon struck with terrifying pace. Kevin De Bruyne rolled a pass to João Cancelo, whose perfectly measured ball had Sterling in before a wall of zebra-striped shirts. The No 7 tapped sideways to Ilkay Gündogan and he smashed home from close range.This had taken 14 minutes. In last season’s 5-0 hammering in the corresponding fixture, City’s opener came after 10 minutes: here was an unwanted similarity that might augur badly for Bruce’s men and when De Bruyne floated a cross-shot at goal moments later Karl Darlow had to scramble to keep out a second.City were in muscular mode. Torres, at centre-forward with Gabriel Jesus a Covid-enforced absence, received from Aké deep inside his half and ran 70 yards, only his tame shot saving Newcastle.Yet despite the lead, Guardiola was unhappy. John Stones and Rodri were given a vocal volley for below-par passes. Torres’s hooked ball that had De Bruyne sprinting clear was received better by the Catalan but the Belgian’s dilly-dallying before a poor effort that Darlow repelled was, again, greeted unfavourably.As the break approached Sterling’s close-range shot did trouble Darlow and presaged the first of two City corners. But Newcastle ended the half with three of their own: the middle one of these had City in disarray and Bruce’s men wandered off at the interval still in the game.A miscontrol by De Bruyne that ceded possession early in the second half suggested City were still not quite as slick as they like to be. Rúben Dias’s pass straight to Jacob Murphy reinforced the impression and further disjointedness ensued when De Bruyne’s free-kick was headed across goal by Stones when the defender should have aimed beyond Darlow.Newcastle’s vague gameplan to cling on and somehow nick an equaliser was underlined by a Joelinton snapshot after 51 minutes that was their first on target. Their strategy appeared in tatters when a Cancelo cross was steered by Federico Fernández into Torres’s path and he made no mistake to make it 2-0. So it proved.It was nearly 3-0 when Bernardo Silva hit Darlow’s left post, though Sterling should have scored with an attempt he miskicked that eventually went to the Portuguese.City looked to have a third from Agüero, on as a late replacement for Torres, only for Darlow to repel at point-blank range from the No 10.Bruce said: “The best side won but it was a decent performance and that was good news.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a79c5585bdc31f3bd854e72d3839f1cd98b0a9/9_300_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9921fb9748d76238f61212f69c4fb9a","title":"granit xhaka strikes a telling blow but it is the age of saka arsenal must embrace","story":"The Swiss midfielder has had a strange Arsenal career of ups and (mostly) downs but his goal against Chelsea could be a catalyst for the club and its managerWith 44 minutes gone, Arsenal 1-0 up and producing a performance of rare verve and energy, Granit Xhaka took a step back and stood completely still, staring at the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal.Bukayo Saka had been fouled 10 yards from the intersection of penalty box and penalty arc. A free-kick for Arsenal was reward for Saka’s fine, driving performance. Above all it looked as if it would be a chance to run down the clock on the half.Chelsea set up a dutiful four-man wall. Xhaka paced back, lining his left foot up with the right-hand corner. There was no disguise. The ball was only ever heading towards that spot in front of the empty Clock End, with its branded tarpaulins, its inspirational messages and the rather hopeful club motto.Victory through harmony: meet Granit. What a strange player Xhaka has been for Arsenal. For an unexceptional, largely pedestrian midfielder, the some-time captain has induced a startlingly extreme range of emotional responses.Does anybody even know his best position yet? Six and half years ago in São Paulo Xhaka produced a masterful display against Lionel Messi’s Argentina as a holding midfielder. In the Premier League he has looked like a poorly programmed robot trying to master the role.Something more creative perhaps? Xhaka may enjoy standing there looking solemn and potent over free‑kicks, but this is a triumph of hope over the cold reality of one league goal since March 2019. He averages three assists a year.So, leadership qualities then? Hmm. We remember the dust-ups, the funks and fallings-out, the match-turning goofs. Xhaka had only just returned to the team at the Emirates after a red-card against Burnley so witless (strangling Ashley Westwood: where can this really lead, Granit?) it left some supporters demanding a public apology.Hair-tearing frustration leavened by odd bumps of hope: this has been the tone of Xhaka’s Arsenal career. And yet, it has been four and a half years now, almost 200 games and a couple of FA Cups.In many ways this has been the Age of Xhaka at Arsenal, with its trapped rage, its bursts of stalled progress, from the dog days of late Wenger, to Mikel Arteta’s attempts to inject his own untried urgency into a group of left-over players.And now here was Xhaka redux, walking forward at an angle and striking the ball with a startling purity, watching it rise over the end of the wall in a flat arc, curling away from the left hand of Édouard Mendy and into the corner of the net.Xhaka ran away not looking that surprised or even that pleased, perhaps wishing, for the first time since lockdown, for the catharsis of home crowd communion.But let’s not pretend here. It seems unlikely this will mark the dawning of a glorious second age of Granit. But it will perhaps stand as one of the great moments of Xhaka’s time at the club, given the pressure of the occasion. Who knows, with a timely, roll-the-dice appearance of good Granit, he may just have done his manager and this team the greatest favour of his Arsenal career.There were green shoots here, and some hope in this performance. But it needed victory to seal the moment, albeit one that arrived via a roundabout route with a wonder‑goal from the embattled non-scoring midfielder, a saved penalty late on, an outrageous third goal from Saka and a slightly soft first‑half penalty won cleverly by Kieran Tierney.And yet Arteta’s team did thoroughly deserve their 3-1 win, a victory for the energy and unscarred verve of the younger players in the starting XI.When Arsenal beat these opponents in the FA Cup final in late summer there was a sense of something taking shape, the outline of a hard-working, fast-breaking, happy-looking team. Fast-forward five months and five key players from that day were either dropped, ill or unavailable – among them the record signing and the lavishly rewarded skipper. A feeling of progress has become slash and burn disaster management.The result was an opportunity for Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli, talented young players who started alongside Saka. All three set the tone, working feverishly hard in the opening half hour.Smith Rowe looked ready for a scrap in the centre of the pitch, a scurrying figure, socks drooping around his shins, always feeding the flanks. Saka, the most experienced of the three, was the key player in the game.He is in his own way a kind of anti‑Xhaka. Saka’s greatest gift is his calm eye, his decision-making, his ability to pick the right pass, the right moment. If Arteta has a future at Arsenal it is these young, talented players who offer the most coherent vision of progress right now.Their energy won this game. Xhaka, the man of this Arsenal age – for better or worse – gave it a gloss that may yet prove significant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9927b0f85017d70354900c56f7f7f2654375601c/0_246_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4803ef89ad10c4540dff46ca75e34ef9","title":"i wont miss ludicrous intrusive var footballs equivalent of brexit","story":"After three decades reporting on the game for the Observer and , I’m bowing out. Here’s a parting shot, along with a few cherished memoriesWhen I joined the Observer in 1990 the country was just rediscovering its love of the national game, thanks to Gazza’s tears and the BBC’s cultured coverage of Italia 90 drawing a line under the careless 1980s, a decade when one horrific disaster after another followed from the general assumption that football supporters were a troublesome subspecies barely worth anyone’s care and attention.In a couple more years the advent of the Premier League would massively increase the game’s prosperity and visibility, allowing grounds to be made safer and more attractive to a wider section of society. Yet encouraging as it was to see female fans and families returning to games, not every subsequent change has been for the better.Back in the early 1990s no one had to worry about football turning into a proxy showcase for nation states with plenty of money but poor human rights records, for instance. The idea of playing a World Cup in Qatar would rightly have been dismissed as ridiculous, Fifa was yet to turn into an international embarrassment and the notion of a Champions League elite, a small cabal of clubs in each European league who would grow richer and stronger at everyone else’s expense, would have struck most as unfair and undesirable.Yet a personal opinion is that what would really have stopped the football watcher of 30 years ago in their tracks would be the discovery that at some point in the future, games would be paused for minutes on end while a group of officials in a bunker miles away pored over minute measurements to decide whether goals should be allowed.Celebrating a goal is one of the delights of attending a live game. Depending on the type of goal, it might take a judicious glance at the linesman’s flag before joy can be unconfined, but no more than that. Football is not cricket or tennis, which are stop-start activities involving hundreds of line decisions per contest. It owes much of its popularity to being spontaneous and free-flowing.Theoretically at least, minutes can pass in a football match without the referee’s whistle or the ball going out of play, just as, in days of yore, most teams could get through most seasons with no more than a handful of genuine gripes about poor refereeing or wrongly awarded goals.It is true there have been a number of high-profile cases where refereeing errors have been picked up by television cameras and highlighted to a living-room audience while the paying fan at the stadium remained in the dark, but that regrettable anomaly could and should have been eliminated some time ago by a combination of goalline technology and making reviews via pitchside monitor available to officials.Instead we have VAR, football’s equivalent of Brexit, self-inflicted damage that becomes more ludicrous and intrusive every week, with no one willing to stand up and say this is not at all what was envisaged. Perhaps it is not exactly an emergency if a sport wants to make a fool of itself in such a way, though the game in England is a market-leading product and it is supposed to be part of the entertainment industry, not a subision of the earth-measuring fraternity.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester and an Everton fan, was bang on when he described VAR as a nitpicker’s charter. The whole principle, that every goal must be retrospectively examined to check whether there is any reason to disallow it, seems wrong, anti-sport, cart before horse. Who decided it was a good idea to give referees so much input, especially ones not even at the game? Who decided football was missing out on line decisions and needed to be brought in line with cricket and tennis?To those who maintain it is important to be correct whatever the length of time it takes or that offside is a black-and-white issue whereby half an inch is just as culpable as half a yard, I would put the following points. Is a player offside by an armpit or a big toe cheating? Are they seeking or obtaining an unfair advantage? And given the distances are so small and players will not always know the exact moment when the ball is played, are they likely to have any idea of whether they are offside or not?If the answer to all three questions is no, as is frequently the case, do we really need the game to be endlessly stopped in a pointless quest for the absolute truth? Some good-looking goals, as well as some crucial ones, have been chalked off because of trifling and unintentional transgressions that no one in the stadium can see.Because, unlike the important lines in cricket and tennis, the offside line is not painted on the floor. Objecting to electronic lines being retrospectively applied is not necessarily a Luddite stance. A sport can make up or amend its own rules, it is not governed by the laws of the universe. Innovations such as the Sinclair C5 or the Betamax cassette prove technology does not always mean progress anyway. The way VAR is being used also feels like something we will end up laughing about in the future.We keep being told teething problems are to be expected and that in time VAR will become quicker and more sophisticated, though my hunch is it will still carry on looking for the wrong things. As we have spent the past few seasons discovering, it is still humans who make the interpretations, so ultimately what is the point?I will miss covering matches when I retire, but I won’t miss writing about VAR. This, I can promise, is my final word on the subject. Goodbye and thanks for reading.Favourite goal: A lot to choose from but Robin van Persie’s “Superman” header for the Netherlands against Spain in the 2014 World Cup remains a vivid memory. It came from nowhere, was like nothing I had seen before and involved an almost unrepeatable combination of skill, luck and timing. Gazza against Scotland in 1996 was pretty good for the same reasons.Favourite chant: “You’re Welsh, and you know you are” – England fans at Cardiff in 2005. Special mention also for the chorus Liverpool supporters reserve for Merseyside derbies – “You haven’t won a trophy since 1995” – set to the tune of For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow. Hard as it is for an Evertonian to admit, you miss that sort of thing in empty stadiums.Luckiest double: May 1999 was notable for two incredible last-minute dramas, Ole Gunnar Solskjær securing Manchester United’s treble at the Camp Nou and the on-loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass going up for a corner at considerably less glamorous Brunton Park to score the goal that kept Carlisle in the league. It was a privilege to be at both events.Hoariest tale: The time in a hotel in Poland when a group of us were discussing the wisdom of the England captain’s tattoo fetish and speculating whether he might end up with one on his head, unaware Mrs Sandra Beckham was dining at the next table, partly hidden by a banquette seat. “Excuse me, that’s my son you’re talking about.”Fondest memory: Palo Alto 1994, with Californian sun blazing down on a roofless stadium and Santana playing on the pitch before Brazil kicked off against Russia. The bloke I bumped out of the way in my eagerness to reach the seat for my first World Cup game turned out to be Pelé, causing an obstruction by signing autographs near the press box."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ef408cba09be1c7d00c52d88ec96e469b403eb/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29215396f6196134642d4fd9ea91d23f","title":"kids and grandparents separated at christmas five ways to share the magic","story":"Being apart doesn’t mean you can’t be together – here’s how to ensure the whole family can join the festivities wherever they are …From pulling crackers en masse to a frenzy of present opening under the tree, so many Christmas traditions are built on the premise of having everyone under one roof, if only for a few hours. And while the easing of lockdown restrictions over the festive period means it will be possible for households to meet up for a few days in limited numbers, many are still planning for immediate-family-only celebrations. For those, Christmas 2020 is a great opportunity to shake things up and make some genuinely one-off memories by finding new ways to share the day with siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents, wherever they may be.For a start, make sure the grandparents are primed for an impromptu FaceTime, and that everyone knows how to schedule a Zoom. Hopefully, over the past year, everyone’s got the hang of “gallery view” and learned the importance of the mute button, but you might want to throw in some extra pointers for the grandparents, such as raising the screen to eye level to eradicate those huge nostrils and extra chins. It might also be wise to settle on a video calling app that all generations feel happy with – whether that’s Skype, Houseparty, Google Hangouts or WhatsApp video calls.Once everyone’s mastered it, try some tech-inspired fun and games to help you stay connected over this unprecedented Christmas period …1. Remote-binge on Christmas moviesNothing signals the start of the Christmas countdown like sitting down to watch your most loved festive film. Thanks to Netflix’s Teleparty feature, kids and grandparents can watch movies such as Arthur Christmas and The Grinch together, live chatting through the best bits. You’ll need to install the browser extension and when you start a Watch Party, others can join it using the code you send them. Get the grandparents set up beforehand to avoid any delay when the kids are poised to hit play.2. Christmas Eve-olutionLet grandparents get a taste of the excitement brewing on the evening of the 24th by scheduling a FaceTime so they can watch the kids laying out mince pies, carrots and a dram of something fortifying for Father Christmas. If they have unlimited broadband, leave it running and you could even do some cookie decorating together, or why not show them how to make some reindeer food to sprinkle outside the house (we hear muesli and glitter is Rudolph’s go-to). The joy of grandparents having this “window” into your living room is that when the hype gets too much – which it will – they can turn down the volume or simply sign off … Voilà, the perks of remote grandparenting!3. Host a special storytimeA Christmas ritual that never gets old? The annual reading of A Visit from St Nicholas (‘Twas the night before Christmas), just as the children are about to fall asleep on the 24th. For a real tradition-meets-tech moment, send the text to grandparents and schedule a candlelit Zoom for bedtime. The kids will fall asleep dreaming of Donner, Blitzen and the rest of the gang while the grandparents get to be the ones who deliver that famous sign off – “Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!” – and hopefully deal with the endless questions about when Santa is going to deliver too.4. Try a treasure huntAn online treasure hunt is a great substitute for a round of charades, especially if you pitch the kids versus the grandparents. How does it work? Simply draw up a list of festive items that you know your kids and parents will have in their houses (think: a bauble, a colourfully-wrapped chocolate, a Christmas card, a teddy bear) and then set up a video call. You read out the list and whoever makes it back to the screen with the item first wins a point. Make sure you have an unusual tiebreaker on the list in case things end in a draw. It’s a great way to add some physical fun to the day and let the kids run off steam, plus Grandpa gets a workout.5. Get your game face onSome kids find video calling difficult – either losing focus or struggling to engage in conversation through the screen. And that’s OK – there’s nothing remotely festive about forcing the fun if one side isn’t into it. A great alternative for older kids and grandparents to stay in relaxed contact is to set them both up with some online games that don’t require face-to-face interaction – Uno, Boggle With Friends and Scrabble Go let you play against friends remotely. And an online game of Trivial Pursuit will satisfy the family’s appetite for some friendly competition, proving that you really don’t need to be in the same room for a game to descend into childish arguments.Vodafone #KeepConnectingFamily traditions help keep us connected to the ones we love, and that’s more important than ever at Christmas.At Vodafone, we’ve built a strong mobile and broadband network that keeps you close to your family and friends … so that we’re still together, even if we are apart.Find out more about how we’re helping you to keep connecting to the magic this Christmas.Third party products mentioned in this article are not Vodafone products and are not associated with Vodafone or endorsed by Vodafone in any way.

This year I predict I will receive one of the four things my wife has recently asked me if I’d like, which she only ever does on my Secret Santa’s behalf, and with all the subtlety of a brick through the window. My brother-in-law Jimmy will hopefully have enjoyed the vinyl LPs I bought him or, at the very least, act like he likes them even if news of his fondness for Afrobeat and Nigerian electronica was greatly exaggerated.Finally, my dad will have been typically delighted with the exalted position he assumes each year, the sole person in these exchanges who receives a gift from everyone, as a sort of drawn-out form of compensation for having endured his litter of demanding, sarcastic and horribly loud children for all these decades. Eventually, we will have logged off one by one, mildly sozzled and slightly melancholy. Sad that we’re apart, but gladdened by the thought that we’ll be together again one day soon, even if that means not being able to turn the audio off whenever we like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d162e0bef93f101f702d78d3885f44627f127735/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=5abe60d479065bb540555aac1bd0ef0a","title":"santa arrives in basra and storm bella strikes boxing days best photos","story":"Storm Bella hits the UK but many traditional Boxing Day activities continue around the world despite coronavirus restrictions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22910ea0be7af925e918143d2472ffd38a869594/0_138_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d6f528269034ed7a8ddaaaa91fa590 700w","title":"how lewis hamilton became one of the uks top sports stars and activists","story":"Writers Michael Eboda and Oliver Owen look at how a 12-year-old go karting champion went on to become Formula One’s most successful driver. This year, more than ever, Hamilton has also been leading the fight against racismThis year, the driver Lewis Hamilton equalled a record seven Formula One world championships when he won the Turkish grand prix in November. Many believe Hamilton is the greatest Formula One driver of all time. He also won BBC Sports Personality of the Year this month and topped The Powerlist 2021, the annual list of the most influential people of African, African Caribbean and African American heritage in the UK. Hamilton is the first sports star to take top billing in the list’s 14-year history. Michael Eboda, the chief executive of Powerful Media, the publisher of the list, tells Rachel Humphreys about meeting a 12-year-old Lewis Hamilton on a go-karting course. It was clear even then, Eboda says, that Hamilton was special. This year he interviewed the driver again, and talked to him about his anti-racism activism. Hamilton has encouraged his fellow drivers to back him by taking a knee before each race convinced his team, Mercedes, to change its cars’ livery from silver to black and set up a commission to make the sport more erse at all levels of employment – all the while showcasing the Black Lives Matter cause with a T-shirt and matching BLM face mask. Humphreys also talks to Oliver Owen, associate editor at the Official Formula 1 magazine. He explains how the combination of Hamilton’s extraordinary talent and “brilliant racing brain” has shaped him into one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time.

Nicky Henderson has won this with Altior, Simonsig and Sprinter Sacre in recent seasons and a ninth win for the trainer in the last 19 runnings will be long odds-on.Chepstow 1.40 Paul Nicholls does not take the wraps off many new recruits at Grade One level so it is no surprise to see Houx Gris, who cost (euros) 200,000 after a win at Auteuil in October, at the top of the market. Marta Des Mottes, though, has a similar profile, ran to a similar level when winning at La Teste last time and Tom Symonds, his trainer, has his string in excellent form.Kempton Park 1.55 Molly Ollys Wishes found plenty of improvement to win at Hereford last time and a 6lb rise is unlikely to stop her here, not least as the step up to three miles should see her make further progress.Chepstow 2.15 Storm Arising idled after jumping the last at Sandown earlier this month and was beaten half a length after looking to have his race won. He still has the strongest form on offer however, and can go one better here.Ten months on from his last appearance, a few days before his 11th birthday and after several false starts, Altior is back and predictably odds-on as he set off towards another tilt at the Champion Chase in March. He has plenty in hand on the official ratings but makes little appeal at cramped odds and the second-season chaser Rouge Vif, who ran well to finish third on his Grade One debut over fences last time, is a more attractive bet at around 8-1.The form of Colin Tizzard’s string is still a little in-and-out but Darlac (3.05) was a ready winner at Wincanton earlier this month and should be able to follow up here if he is in the same form on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20be51eb046da36e312bfb0f2db0aea4c0bf0e53/945_88_1941_1165/master/1941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55ea47d63ad9df40e62889031f021c0","title":"paul deacon welcomes switch of focus as he settles into role at sale","story":"Paul Deacon admits he has had sleepless nights since becoming Sale’s head coach on an interim basis this month and is hoping a change of competition will bring him some rest.Deacon, Sale’s attack coach since 2015, was promoted after the abrupt resignation of the club’s director of rugby Steve Diamond following the last round of Premiership matches and just before the start of their Heineken Champions Cup campaign.Defeats in Toulon and, unexpectedly, at home to Edinburgh have left them free to concentrate on the league. They started the Christmas round in fourth place after winning two of their first three matches and on Sunday will be looking for their fourth consecutive Premiership victory over last season’s beaten finalists, Wasps.“The mood in the camp is good, but we want to get rid of the frustration of the last two weeks,” said Deacon, who this weekend has been able to pick the England flanker Tom Curry for the first time. “It was a tough team selection this week, but it is good to have that problem.“Selection is the big difference between what I did before and now. I have had a few sleepless nights and it is something I have to get used to. Being the top man is different, but enjoyable. There is a lot more to think about and where before I did not have to talk to players who were not picked, I need to explain to them now and make sure they remain motivated. You have to think about everyone in the organisation all the time.”Diamond’s departure was a shock because in the 10 years he was at Sale, they had turned from a club that could not afford to spend the salary cap to one which had become a top four contender and a regular in the Champions Cup with ambitions to keep climbing.“A good result is crucial every week if you want to fight at the top of the league, which is where we believe we can be,” said Deacon. “We are at home on Sunday and we pride ourselves on playing there. I am looking for consistency and we will need an 80-minute performance against Wasps.”Sale supporters can expect little change under Deacon who aims to continue the work started by Diamond. But for an outbreak of Covid-19 at the club last October that caused them to forfeit their final match at home to Worcester, they would probably have made the play-offs.“I want the players to be free and positive, making the right decisions at the right time,” he said. “You cannot throw the ball around all the time, but I want the players to believe in each other. I have learned an awful lot in the five years I have been here because of the trust Steve Diamond put in me into how we attack. There is continuity and that is a good thing. All that has changed is that there is now a bit more responsibility on my shoulders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a03d886d21a3aad91b8ac50dfc18523232435a/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e11c2a217bfc57908e9bbc40e6227288","title":"her smile made it all worth the effort local shopkeepers on their most memorable moments of 2020","story":"Thanks to sweet and hopeful exchanges in stores across the country, the special bonds forged between independent retailers and customers will outlast the pandemicLocal shopkeepers have had many reasons to despair this year. The pandemic has brought unimaginable levels of uncertainty and financial pressure. However, amid the despair, there have also been moments of hope. Moments that have convinced shopkeepers to carry on, or just moments that have made them smile. Many of these were thanks to the special relationships that have been forged between local shops and customers. And each moment highlights just how much it means to businesses when we choose to shop locally.“There have actually been several standout moments,” says Barry Whitehouse, who owns The Artery art shop in Banbury, Oxfordshire. When the first lockdown began, The Artery started offering free online art classes. “We’ve been so touched by the feedback from all over the world,” he says. “The lessons we gave during the first lockdown have had more than 14,000 views, and we now have people worldwide joining in our regular online classes or free monthly demonstrations.”One standout moment occurred when two viewers actually showed up in person to express their gratitude. “In between lockdowns, we had a visit from a couple who live in Lanzarote but who have family from Gloucester,” says Whitehouse. “They made the 40-plus-mile trip to visit the shop to see us and express their appreciation of our free art classes and demonstrations during the first lockdown, and said how much it helped them and gave them focus while they were isolated from all of their family and friends.”These moments of connection with their new global community have had a big impact on Whitehouse and his team: “It’s amazed and humbled us that so many people value what we do and as a tiny little shop we have been able to reach people from all over the world.”Expressions of customer gratitude have had a profound effect on local businesses – expressions that have ranged from heartfelt thanks to big gestures.Weyfish fishmongers in Weymouth, Dorset, introduced home deliveries for the first time when pandemic restrictions began, with owner Sean Cooper’s wife, Maxine, taking on delivery duties. Neither of them could have imagined what would happen one morning when she proceeded down a driveway to do a contactless delivery. “The self-isolating couple asked her to just stand where she was – it turned out they were both musicians and had written a thank you song for her and for Weyfish,” says Cooper. “They serenaded her then and there in the driveway. She was so blown away that she froze, so didn’t film it.”The couple lived a little way away so hadn’t been regular customers, but afterwards they started visiting the shop on a weekly basis. “That’s what it is all about,” he says. “That’s what makes it worthwhile.”Meanwhile, Martha Brown, who runs Forge Bakehouse in Sheffield, decided to introduce local deliveries back in March, with her parents volunteering to be drivers. She says they now receive eggs from the farm of one of their regulars when they arrive with the customer’s order. “A customer giving eggs from their own chickens as a thank you just seems so lovely and extra special, and shows the support for us as a local business,” says Brown.Some local businesses, such as Nic Bottomley, who co-owns bookshop Mr B’s Emporium of Reading Delights in Bath with wife Juliette, have been buoyed by seeing their existing shop community adapt to the social distancing measures necessitated by the pandemic. “The great thing about bookselling at the best of times is that our customers are always quick to feed back and quick to let us know how they’ve been enjoying – or not, as the case may be – a particular book we’ve recommended,” he says. “In lockdown, those same customers have been so generous in their thanks for us getting books and book recommendations to them, and just continue to connect with us about the books by phone or email.”The shift to digital and e-commerce during the pandemic has also led to local retailers such as Mr B’s developing a more far-flung community. Bottomley says “one of the biggest buzzes of the season” came from one such connection. “We embarked on a number of projects on YouTube for our customers, including informal author interviews and daily children’s storytime sessions during the first lockdown. As a result, we had an incredible email from Miguel in Brazil who wanted to thank us,” he says. The email explained how Miguel’s family now watches videos from Mr B’s Emporium of Reading Delights regularly. “It’s such a delight to watch these videos,” the email stated. “My son loves it, and we want to thank you for this wonderful opportunity in such difficult times. Thanks for bringing such joy and happiness.”For Andrea Mahoney, owner of CoLab gift shop in Bristol, the global and local came together during her most poignant moments of the pandemic. “One customer experience in particular stands out most for me,” she says. “I had a customer in New Zealand contact me to order some gifts for his sister who lived not too far from the shop. Between us, we organised gift wrapping and included a handwritten card that I hand-delivered to her house on her birthday – she had absolutely no idea and was completely bowled over,” says Mahoney. “Thinking about the look of surprise on her face keeps me going.”For other local shopkeepers, such as Kalkidan Legesse, owner of Exeter ethical fashion and lifestyle store Sancho’s, the most meaningful encounters have occurred when things were at the most difficult. “When we first realised we needed to close the shop we invited our customers to buy gift cards for themselves to use at a later date,” she says. The result? More than 100 orders – a response that had a big effect: “This made us feel like ultimately people wanted us to be around and encouraged us to keep on going,” says Legesse.Winston Farquharson owns SE20 Cycles in Penge, London, and describes the pandemic as being both the best of times and the worst of times. “We’ve experienced moments of despair when told a common bike part is not available and nor would it be for several months,” he says. However, there have been bright moments as well. “In the middle of all of that, we sold a bicycle to a key worker – not a nurse or an occupational therapist, but someone we rely on daily to clear our refuse and make our life habitable,” he says. “The customer had put a deposit on a bike at the beginning of the first lockdown and was walking in the early hours to her place of work. Her smile and gratitude in June when her bike finally arrived was something to marvel. It made me feel absolutely that we have something to strive for and this made it all worth the effort.”This sense that one meaningful sale makes it all worth the effort is shared by many local retailers. Furthermore, these interactions have reassured them, too. Whitehouse, from The Artery, says such encounters “have given us hope and made us feel we may come out of this and still be able to be open, maybe even stronger”.Mahoney says likewise about her most memorable moment: “It gives me hope for 2021, inspired some wonderful ideas and I can honestly say I am excited. CoLab will get through this and we will be stronger in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d5b84329fe1fac295b3061422684bbb15d0691/0_1181_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b5d57883b78f7c101be9d2fc53190273","title":"coronavirus live covid vaccine inoculation lockdown eu uk news latest updates","story":"Latest updates: millions of Europeans due to get inoculated today OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is set for approval in the UK this weekA nurse has become the first person in Malta to get vaccinated, according to a tweet by prime minister Robert Abela. Another Mediterranean island nation, Cyprus, has also started vaccinating its population.Pensioners at homes in the capital Nicosia and the towns of Larnaca and Limassol were the first to receive a shot of the two-dose vaccine, which arrived by air on Saturday.Cyprus has reported 19,391 cases of the novel coronavirus, and 111 deaths. A German pilot has traced the image of a syringe on a flight path to celebrate the arrival of the vaccine in Germany, Flightradar24 reports. Simply Flying has this write-up:Taking off from Bodensee Airport Friedrichshafen (FDH) at 10.04 local time on 24 December, the pilot proceeded to draw an intricate depiction of a syringe, complete with droplets from the needle. The flight-path pattern required rather sharp turns, but the nimble Diamond DA20 Katana aircraft with registration D-ENIG was well-suited to the task.The pilot reached a height of 5,475ft and a top speed of 121 knots just as they were completing one side of the syringe’s barrel. The thin line of the needle was accomplished by backtracking the exact flight path they had taken to its tip.Having completed the piece of sky-art invisible to the naked eye, the pilot landed the DA20 back at FDH one hour and 44 minutes after take-off.A 96-year-old living in a care home in central Spain has become the first Spaniard to be vaccinated against Covid-19, in an event broadcast by national television, AFP reports.Araceli Rosario Hidalgo Sanchez said with a smile that she felt “nothing” from the injection.The pensioner, living in the Los Olmos retirement home in Guadalajara, got up slowly after pulling on her black jacket and walked off using a frame for support.Carer Monica Tapias followed as the second Spaniard to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The Los Olmos home was picked to kick off the country’s inoculation campaign because it sits near a Pfizer storage depot, where vaccines were delivered from Belgium on Saturday before nationwide distribution.No cases of Covid-19 have so far been detected among the staff or residents.“It’s a great source of pride and a great satisfaction for us. We’re representing all the retirement homes in Spain,” the director, Marina Vadillo, said on Thursday.After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last Monday, the way is open for injections across the 27-member bloc.Russia reported 28,284 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 3,050,248 after it crossed the 3 million mark the previous day.Russia’s coronavirus crisis centre said 552 coronavirus patients had died in the last 24 hours and the overall national coronavirus death toll was at 54,778. The Sunday Times says the jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is expected to be approved for use in the UK by Thursday. In an interview AstraZeneca as chief executive Pascal Soriot says: “We think we’ve figured out the winning formula to maximise the protection offered”. He believes the vaccine will work against mutations of the virus, but admits further tests will be required to prove this.The Sun on Sunday says the Oxford jab will be approved on Monday and the first injections are expected to be rolled out a week later. Cases of the new variant strain first detected in the UK have been confirmed across Europe including in France, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Iceland, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands, as well as around the globe in Australia, Japan and Lebanon.And Dr Barbara Yaffe, the associate chief medical officer of Canada’s Ontario province, said the first two confirmed cases were a couple from the country’s Durham region with no known travel history, exposure or high-risk contacts.People living in Ontario, like those in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and much of England, are now living under lockdown measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.The Czech Republic started administering vaccinations against the new coronavirus on Sunday, part of a push against the pandemic across the European Union.Prime Minister Andrej Babis was the first to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the Central Military Hospital in Prague, just before other hospitals in the capital and second-largest city Brno started to distribute the 9,750 doses the country has received so far.“The vaccine which arrived from the European Union yesterday, that is a hope, a hope that we will return to a normal life,” Babis said before taking the jab.Emilie Repikova, 95, a World War Two veteran, was also one of the first to be inoculated, shortly after Babis.The country closed non-essential shops, services and ski lifts and enforced a stricter curfew from Sunday as it seeks to curb another rise in COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations. Welcome to a Sunday edition of our Coronavirus live blog covering both the UK and global developments on the virus.The official vaccination programme against coronavirus gets underway in several EU countries today. In some places inoculations began last night when health workers in Hungary, Slovakia and Germany got their first injections of the PfizerBioNtech jab. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, was vaccinated this morning at a military hospital in Prague. In the UK there is speculation in the Sunday papers that the OxfordAstraZeneca will get approval for use this week and perhaps as early as tomorrow.Meanwhile, the largest hospital in Wales has used social media to appeal for help from medical students to treat intensive care patients."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445874.1608990073!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pandemic calls halt to st stephen s day sales in eerily quiet dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Garda car on Henry Street in Dublin city centre, where retailers have been asked to defer sales until January.  Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireWhat happened Next was what the 15 or so men, women and children standing impatiently in a semi-socially distanced queue outside the retailer’s flagship store on Henry Street wanted to know.While the sign in the Next window said it should have opened its doors at 8am on St Stephen’s Day – a good two hours later than a normal year when it would be in full sale frenzy by 6am – there was still no sign of lights or life inside at around 9.15am.“I don’t know what’s going on,” the man close to the top of the line said. “I’ve just Googled it and it says the shop should be well open now”.The queue leading nowhere was as clear a sign as any that the traditional shopping splurge of St Stephen’s Day was not going to plan and would be a whole lot different in 2020 than any normal year.The winter sales window which had been due to open in towns and cities across Ireland was slammed shut by the Cabinet and by Covid-19 on the eve of Christmas and the shops that had decided to open their doors as scheduled were making it very clear they were not having a sale.Seasonal discounts? Sure. Sale? Absolutely no way. People were directed online only for that carry on.Shortly before 9am, the doors of Arnotts opened. On Christmases past, the moment would have been marked by a phalanx of press photographers snapping away at the crowds of people happily streaming through the doors. But on Saturday morning the shoppers were few and far between and the press photographers had been given the morning after the big day off.All through the beauty hall and across the concessions, staff outnumbered customers by a significant margin.“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” one member of staff said as he stood trying to make himself look busy.It was an impossible task, really. Shortly before 9.30am the large television screen at the Mary Street entrance which counts the numbers in the shop in real time read 106. Then 30 seconds later it had fallen to 103. Just over 100 shoppers spread over four floors.The absence of voices and Christmas songs booming from shops along Henry Street meant conversations that would once have been more private echoed up and down the road. Outside a shut-up Boots, one woman was chatting to a street sweeper.“There are no queues anywhere,” she said, as yet oblivious to the mini-queue which had formed further up the road outside Next. “And all the shops are either empty or closed. It’s weird isn’t it.”The street sweeper nodded. “Mad,” he said.On O’Connell Bridge, possibly the coldest and windiest part of the city centre, a Garda checkpoint had just been set up and three bitterly-cold looking guards stopped cars and chatted, mostly amicably, to the drivers who rolled down their windows.It was, if anything, even quieter on Grafton Street with Brown Thomas one of only a handful of retailers to open its doors in the early morning.This day last week the Brown Thomas plan had been to launch its winter sale on St Stephen’s Day but public health advice and the Government’s demand that sales be deferred derailed that entirely and the shop was very clear that it was not having a sale.It did have seasonal discounts, mind you, most of which had been rolled out in the run-up to Christmas.The shop had been due to open at 9am but opened some 30 minutes early, not, one staff member said, to accommodate any queues which had formed.As it was across the river, the staff members outnumbered the shoppers but, given the times we live in no one was overly glum about that and the signs of the public health messages and the need to keep crowds to a minimum were evident at every turn.As the gloomy morning sky lightened there was no surge of shoppers and the only groups in evidence were the by-now traditional gatherings of teenage boys in puffa jackets out seeking bargains.Back across the Liffey in Arnotts several of the puffa groups wandered aimlessly having already scored the trainers they had come in search of.“Do you have any AirPods?” one young man asked a staff member in the tech department.“No,” came the terse answer. “They were well gone before Christmas.”The group shrugged and made a plan to go for breakfast in McDonalds instead.Shortly before 10am, there was still no movement in the Next queue although many of those who had been waiting had given up and gone in search of offers elsewhere.The man who had been at the top of the queue was among those who had given up and he had been replaced by a young woman. “It’s still shut,” she said to someone on the other end of her mobile phone line. “I’m not sure what I am doing here.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Government will look at living wage after Covid-19 exposed income inequality, says MartinRandal Plunkett turned from a self-confessed steak-lover to a pioneering eco-advocateIrish scientist keen to unburden young people of weight of climate challenge in TV lecture"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4443051.1608570271!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how the baron of dunsany carried out an ambitious rewilding project in meath","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRandal Plunkett, the 21st baron of Dunsany, is a film director and holder of one of the oldest surviving Irish peerage titles. Photograph: Barry CroninLike his ancestors, Randal Plunkett was once able to look from the windows of Dunsany Castle, between Trim and Dunshaughlin, Co Meath, onto herds of cattle and sheep that filled many of the estate’s 1,600 acres.Today, the cattle and sheep are gone: “When I became a vegan, I couldn’t really continue to have livestock here, could I?” the 21st baron of Dunsany, from a line tied by blood linked to St Oliver Plunkett, reflected.Plunkett is part of the European Rewilding Network, which is attempting to restore nature across the continent, from reintroducing wild bison in the Vanatori-Neamt park in Romania, to the restoration of the huge Naliboksky Forest in Belarus.If difficult to bring about, the mission statement of the European project – which was set up in 2011 in the Netherlands, but has since spread its influence – is simple.“It’s about letting nature take care of itself, enabling natural processes to shape land and sea, repair damaged ecosystems and restore degraded landscapes,” it declares.For Randal Plunkett, Ireland’s first member of the project, the work in Dunsany began six years ago with a decision to rewild 750 of the 1,600 acres around Dunsany Castle and rid the plains of the vast estate from sheep and cows.The first fruits are emerging. This year, the estate had the first breeding pair of woodpeckers ever recorded in Co Meath, along with sightings of red kites, snipe and stoats – and even an unconfirmed spotting of the rare red squirrel.Confirming the presence of the pair of greater spotted woodpeckers, Niall Hatch of BirdWatch Ireland said: “There is no evidence that they were ever in Meath before.” However, a few have been found in recent years in Wicklow, having migrated from Britain.“We have rewilded about 750 acres. Up to 500 acres is forestry and another 250 acres are grass fields,” said Randal, “Before, we had our own herd of cattle and sheep and rented out fields to farmers who grazed their animals.”Decades of gestationThough begun six years ago, the work has been in gestation for decades: “I’ve never been convinced that animal agriculture is cost-effective and it’s proven that it is detrimental to the environment.“I don’t think that it is the way forward to focus on such an inefficient means to produce food, particularly when you see the level of carbon being emitted as a result of it,” said Randal.“We still have tillage but everything else is being left to wildlife which I’ve never interfered with, not even by sowing grass in the initial stages.“When we first allowed things to go wild, we had a lot of weeds at first, as you can imagine. It was the worst thistle and ragwort that I had ever seen. But then, as the weeds began to abate, saplings and wildlife started to appear as the natural ecosystem took hold.“I used to pull up to 40 stalks of ragwort a day to avoid chemicals. Now I don’t need to, as there are hardly any because wild flowers and plants have taken control.“We started to see a lot more insects. Then more small birds appeared before the bigger birds of prey began making their home here,” he declared.Recently, visiting botanists from Dublin’s Trinity College – who have come to the estate ever more frequently as the changes wrought by the rewilding have become visible on the ground – spotted 50 butterflies within 200m of each other.“That’s a lot of butterflies in such a short distance. It’s really interesting to see how nature has balanced itself. There are no great quantities of any one thing,” said Randal, who took over the estate from his father in 2011.“I think when it comes to climate change and the ecosystem, we really do tend to overthink things. The environment needs to simply be allowed to exist.“When I first started this, I tried to do a lot, but now I realise that instead of trying to control it, I just try and maintain and enhance what is there.”Rehabilitating animalsIn the last number of months especially, Randal has been rehabilitating injured animals and birds found on the land and releasing them back into the wild.“I’d say in recent months, we have helped to save six injured foxes, 12 hedgehogs and a large number of birds.”His project has gained national recognition from agencies such as BirdWatch Ireland and the Irish Bee Conservation Project, who are hoping to co-operate with Randal to create up to 200 hives for dwindling native Irish black bees in the years ahead.“At a time when global warming is a massive issue, there are very few doing anything really about it, in my view.“I’m lucky enough to be in a position where I’ve got privilege and can do something to help.”So far, the work at Dunsany is being funded by Randal himself: “I’m not getting any grants or money from anywhere at the present. I feel that I’m doing my duty to my country and my planet.“The estate is a business so it’s all about balancing a budget. I have gone without holidays and other things for this, but no success is without sacrifice.“This is important and it transcends comforts.“At the moment, I’m funding the project myself with income from tillage and my film production facilities in Dunsany. Every time a company uses these facilities, they are contractually obligated to donate a tree to the reserve.“We have plans to plant more forestry in the next five years, possibly with the aid of State forestry subsidies at that stage.”The rewilding project is not without its obstacles.“I face challenges all the time. One of the biggest threats to this project is overdevelopment of this area.“In the current Dunshaughlin area plan, there is talk about a new train line cutting across parts of this forest – the very forest where the woodpeckers are now living.Embracing challengeIt’s nine years since the film-maker inherited the ancient castle before his 30th birthday, after the death of his father Edward Plunkett, the 20th baron of Dunsany.The young man embraced the rural challenge, despite it being worlds apart from New York, where he grew up, and London, where he studied film-making.However, despite the rewilding, he still manages to maintain his love of film, with a new production he wrote and directed, The Green Sea, due to be released next year.Although now a strict vegan, he is the first to admit he was a huge lover of meat dishes in his younger days.“I was the biggest proponent of steak. I ate a lot of it and I ate raw eggs for breakfast like Rocky, before finally realising that it’s not good for you or the environment.“I was a steak-eating, rock-concert-going city slicker and now I’m lord of the rural manor who has swapped leather clothes and shoes for more eco-friendly cruelty-free options.“Wild nature gives you something you didn’t expect that you needed. Before, I was interested in possessions, status and money. That was all that motivated me. Now, even if I achieve nothing else in my life, I will consider it a success.”Passionate about his new lifestyle, he hopes it will make a difference and encourage others.“At the minute, the vision is wilderness. The future has to be rewilding. I’ll be long gone in 200 years but the trees I’m planting will hopefully be enjoyed by generations to come, if we embrace bioersity now.”The European Rewilding Network can help others across the continent to deliver rewilding dreams, he believes: “I feel privileged to join a movement of like-minded iniduals who are committed to restoring Europe’s natural heritage.“We are already on the last bus, but if we all got together and acted now and governments followed, then we still have a chance.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4443914.1608653493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 what new restrictions are being introduced and when","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced that the country will return to Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, with some adjustments, from Christmas Eve until January 12th due to a sharp rise in coronavirus cases.

Photograph: Crispin Rodwell The The Government has announced renewed Level 5 restrictions to place the country into a lockdown in the coming days until at least January 12th. So what is happening, and when?Is Christmas cancelled?No, new restrictions on household visits and inter-county travel will only come into effect from midnight on St Stephen’s Day.So I can still have household visits?People will be able to host visitors from two different households until St Stephen’s Day, after that it will be limited to visits from one other household up to New Year’s Eve. From January 1st visits to private homes or gardens will again be banned, except for essential family reasons or people in support bubbles.Can I leave my county?Restrictions on non-essential travel between counties had been relaxed to allow family members gather for the Christmas holidays.The ban on inter-county travel will be reintroduced after St Stephen’s Day. However, people staying with family in another county for Christmas will not be required to return home immediately after December 26th. They will be allowed to travel between counties after this date if they are returning home.And pubs and restaurants?We knew the traditional Christmas Eve pub experience was never going to happen this year. The Government has moved to close restaurants, cafes, and pubs serving food from 3pm on Christmas Eve, restricting them to takeaway and delivery services only.What else is changing?Hairdressers, salons, cinemas, galleries, and museums are to close from Christmas Eve, while gyms and swimming pools will remain open for inidual training only. Mass and religious services will move online after Christmas Day.Non-essential retail will be allowed to remain open, but will be encouraged to avoid holding any large sales events.Hotels are to close for all non-essential bookings after St Stephen’s Day. Travel restrictions from Britain are to be extended until December 31st.Up to midnight on January 2nd, 25 guests can attend weddings, but this will be limited to six guests from January 3rd. Funerals are limited to 10 mourners.Golf and outdoor tennis will still be permitted, while for team sports non-contact training can take place outdoors in pods of up to 15 people.Professional and elite sports, as well as horse and greyhound racing, can continue behind closed doors.So another lockdown?Pretty much: restaurants and bars shuttered apart from takeaway services no non-essential travel out of your county no haircuts and no household visits from January 1st. The main difference between this and the previous lockdown is gyms and non-essential retail shops can remain open this time.How long will this one last?The Government has said the measures will be reviewed on January 12th.However, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the restrictions may have to remain in place until the end of February, when substantial numbers of people have received the vaccine.What was the previous plan?Originally the plan was to allow people a near three-week window where travel between counties and home visits from other households were allowed.The restrictions on inter-county travel and household visits were eased on December 18th, and initially not due to be reimposed until January 6th.What has Nphet said?Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan wrote to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Monday saying Level 5 restrictions would be needed at some point after Christmas.In early December, modelling from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) estimated Ireland could see between 800 and 1,200 cases a day by mid-January, given increased socialising over Christmas.Over the last week the situation began to rapidly deteriorate, with cases rising much more quickly than public health officials or politicians had expected in the run-up to Christmas.Latest models graphing the potential spread suggest the country could now see between 1,300 and 1,800 daily cases by early January.However, on Tuesday the Government said given current growth cases could perhaps exceed 2,000 a day as early as the start of the new year.Any good news?Well like cavalry on the horizon, the vaccine is on the way.

They were to be the last one-on-one meetings between the leaders as Thatcher resigned in November 1990 and Haughey stepped down in early 1992. Their decade-long political interactions had been marked by early cordiality, then distrust, and finally a stronger relationship during Haughey’s second term.During 1990, German chancellor Helmut Kohl, French president François Mitterand and commission president Jacques Delors had proposed greater political union among the 12 EC members following the end of the Warsaw Pact and the reunification of Germany.When Haughey broached the subject of political union with Thatcher, he said it could be “as minimalist or as maximalist as we make it”.The British prime minister replied curtly. “There was first of all an economic community. Then we widened it to develop European political co-operation. We have enough to digest at present. If we go further we will create even wider isions,” she told Haughey.More developedShe then compared Ireland and the UK favourably to other member states, saying they were far more developed.“Germany has been in existence for some 40 years. Belgium is simply the Walloons and the Flemings. The Dutch were part of the Hapsburg Empire. On the other hand, Spain is a proud nation and so is France,” she said.She noted, after unification, “Germany will be so powerful that it will dominate everyone.“They will be dealing with a powerful and dominating nation of maybe 80 to 90 million people with a new confidence – a new euphoria.”Thatcher reserved her harshest criticism for the European Commission, which she said was anti-democratic.“The days of appointed commissioners must be numbered. We must give power to the council of ministers. I am not handing over authority to a non-elected bureaucracy...“We must take away the power of initiative from the commission. Can we get this through?”The taoiseach replied: “I don’t think so.”“They are just a new politburo,” she added.“The commission was necessary for the European Community to start off, but it is a totally non-democratic power structure now. It is not responsible to the European Parliament or to any other parliament. What we need there is a proper, professional civil service to serve the council ministers. We must metamorphose it into that.”Haughey replied: “I don’t disagree. We don’t want any more powers for the European Parliament at any rate.”Thatcher said: “Kaput! It is not a parliament at all.”“With you and me there’s intimate and instant accountability. Italy was never one nation. Portugal is struggling and needs help. How can this group of people form a union?” she asked.Thatcher emphasised the disparate nature of European countries during the two meetings, claiming the Italians “will continue not to pay taxes” and berating Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou for “petty interference” by lecturing her on the rights of part-time workers.“Italy quite cheerfully propose this and that and then just as cheerfully ignores that that does not suit them. Try to force this process too far and we will all become subsidiaries of Germany,” she said.“This is why we think you should take a major part in this debate,” said Mr Haughey.She replied: “There is no paper before us. What does political union mean? Are they going to change the crowned head of every country? Are they going to change the president of your country? Each country has a parliament. Are they going to change that?“If you give away your powers of taxation you have lost your sovereignty. In talking of a single currency, Delors must have had a rush of blood the the head. We are not going to have a single currency.”‘Commit’She continued: “I am not in a position to commit my country for seven to nine years ahead. I don’t know what is going to happen in the USSR. I don’t know how Germany will develop.”When Haughey asked her about expanding the membership of the community from 12, she was more favourable, saying Norway, Austria and Sweden should not be turned down. She also said a door should be kept open for Turkey. “Above all I don’t want Turkey to fall back into the Muslim world,” she said.“Their workforce is highly efficient. They will buy German – as the Japanese buy Japanese and the French buy French. They are highly efficient and totally ruthless. You talk about the European Community. In the end there will only be three powers in the world: the US, Germany and Japan. The rest of us must really stand together.”The notes of the conversations were taken by secretary to the government Dermot Nally (National Archives reference 20203246)Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445382.1609024054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ira sought to bypass sinn f%C3%A9in in talks with british new files suggests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAftermath of the 1990 IRA car bomb attack in Derry when five  soldiers died and van driver Patsy Gillespie was also killed. File photograph: Pacemaker The IRA’s army council wanted to negotiate peace directly with the British government rather than its “least favoured option” of Sinn Féin joining talks, according to newly declassified files.Documents, just released into the National Archives under the 30-year rule, suggest the Provisional IRA leadership did not unanimously back the party, but could “impose its view” on Sinn Féin, while the “reverse was not the case”.A memo, marked secret, to then taoiseach Charlie Haughey in May 1990 updates him on efforts by two Maze prison chaplains – Fr John Murphy and the Rev Will Murphy – to nudge the IRA and the UVF away from violence.As part of the early peace initiative, Fr Murphy had just had a “series of intensive discussions with the IRA Army Council”.Briefing Irish diplomat Brendan McMahon about the discussions, the priest said the army council favoured direct secret talks, ahead of calling a ceasefire, with the British government.“The Army Council’s preference is naturally for such talks to be held in public, though they accept that any talks would probably have to be conducted in absolute secrecy,” according to a note of the briefing from Fr Murphy (archive file 20201734).“The IRA’s third, and least favoured option, would be for talks involving Sinn Féin.”Fr Murphy told McMahon that “one thing which has struck him in the course of this initiative is the noticeable difference between the IRA and Sinn Féin – with Army Council members referring to Sinn Féin as merely ‘the party which is closest to our view’ ”.Murphy’s impression was that “not all of the army council are particularly enamoured with the socialist views being espoused by the current urban based leadership of Sinn Féin”.Prelates briefedThe two chaplains had briefed four church leaders at the time: Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiach, Archbishop Robin Eames, Bishop Cathal Daly and Bishop Sam Poyntz of the IRA’s “willingness to seek an alternative to the campaign of violence” and that it was prepared “to enter exploratory discussions with the British government”.Fr Murphy noted that there was “no question of a ceasefire at this stage” but that the intensity of IRA violence at the time might be “reduced” in the event of talks taking place.Ó Fiach and Eames had both agreed to meet then secretary of state Peter Brooke to push for the talks.In a separate memo to the taoiseach, Irish diplomat Dermot Gallagher, who went on to become secretary general of the Department of Foreign Affairs, notes a meeting he held with Daly, then Primate designate, in November 1990 at the church leader’s brother’s house in Belfast.Daly told Gallagher that former IRA chief of staff Sean MacStiofáin – who “keeps in regular touch with the IRA leadership” – briefed him regularly on the army council’s thinking.“As to the relationship between the IRA and Sinn Féin, the Bishop said that he is convinced that they are separate organisations he also expressed the view that, while the IRA was in a position to impose its view on Sinn Féin, the reverse was not the case,” the memo records.In 1990 the IRA killed British politician and solicitor Ian Gow outside his home in east Sussex as well as increase its use of proxy bombs. On October 24th, Catholic man Patsy Gillespie was strapped into a car in Derry and forced to drive an IRA car bomb into a British army checkpoint, killing him and five British soldiers.‘Depths of horror’In an effort to get peace talks off the ground, Hume was regularly briefing the Irish government about his contacts.In one memo of a briefing, also marked secret, the then SDLP leader said an emissary for the IRA had warned him that if peace efforts weren’t seized there would be at least two more decades of violence which would “plunge new depths of horror” including the shooting of nationalist politicians on the streets.Hume told the government he was approached by Derry businessman Brendan Duddy “with what Duddy claimed was a document agreed by the IRA Army Council”.Duddy was used by the IRA as an intermediary to Hume twice before and had driven Hume “part of the way” to a secret meeting with the IRA, so his approach was to be “taken seriously”, according to the memo.The document foresaw an all-island nationalist conference being held – with an agreed date for the IRA to declare a ceasefire – in which a common strategy towards a united Ireland would be worked out “and subsequently presented to European Community leaders”.“In this regard, the text was couched in language which emphasised Ireland’s place and role in Europe, and the fact that Irish people had always been European in outlook,” Hume told the government.“The thinking here seemed to be that the British could be pressurised into responding positively to nationalist objectives through an effective campaign waged in a European context.”Duddy went on to express “great concern” to Hume that if the “feelers from the IRA were left unanswered, the violence in the North could continue for another twenty years – and would in this period plunge new depths of horror”.The businessman told Hume that there was “some hope of ending the campaign while Adams and people of his age group were in charge”.“He was deeply worried and frightened, however, by the attitude of the huge mass of young (i.e. under thirty five) alienated, unemployed Catholics,” the memo notes.“If they took over at some stage, then even more extreme action was possible – including, if they thought it helpful to their strategy, the shooting of nationalist politicians in the street.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445885.1608997603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phil hogan insists resignation over golfgate disproportionate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Former EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan  and Supreme Court judge Seamus Woulfe in January 2018. File photograph: PAFormer European commissioner for trade Phil Hogan has said his resignation over his attendance at a controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in August was “disproportionate”. Speaking in an interview published in the Irish Independent, Mr Hogan said he was not afforded due process amid a “political frenzy” following the dinner in Clifden, Co Galway. More than 80 guests – primarily politicians – attended the dinner in two rooms ided by a partition at the Station House Hotel, in apparent breach of Covid-19 public health guidelines limiting gatherings.“I think most fair-minded people thought what happened was disproportionate, and that has been by the due process that was given to Justice Séamus Woulfe and the report that was done by Susan Denham,” Mr Hogan said. “It would have been nice if I had got some kind of due process. When that was given to Séamus Woulfe, you can see full details were able to emerge,” he said. Mr Hogan resigned after several days of sustained pressure over his attendance at the dinner, and scrutiny over his movements around Ireland in the days beforehand after he returned from Brussels. At the time the former Fine Gael minister had insisted a negative Covid-19 test excused him from quarantining after arriving in Ireland from Belgium, and exemptions for essential work meant he was permitted to break local lockdown restrictions in Co Kildare. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had requested he provide an account of his movements while in Ireland, with his resignation following in the days afterwards. In the interview, Mr Hogan said he felt there was one set of standards and criteria for politicians, and another for those who were not elected officials. “But it was the context, I suppose, of the political frenzy at the time last August,” he said. Rise TD Paul Murphy was critical of the comments made by the former commissioner. “The fact that Phil Hogan still doesn’t get it underlines how wildly out of touch he and the rest of the political establishment are. He broke multiple Covid guidelines while people were suffering massively, yet still thinks he was in some way hard done by,” he said.The scandal also saw the resignation of Dara Calleary as minister for agriculture, and a number of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members and councillors lost the party whip. Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, a former attorney general, faced calls to resign from his position over his attendance at the dinner, but did not do so. In a report into his actions, former chief justice Susan Denham concluded seeking his removal would be “unjust and disproportionate”. However, there were renewed calls for Mr Justice Woulfe to step down following the release of transcripts of his interview with Ms Denham, which reignited the controversy. Mr Hogan had first served as EU agriculture commissioner, before securing the coveted trade portfolio late last year. Mairead McGuinness replaced Mr Hogan as Ireland’s commissioner, and was allocated the financial services brief."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445400.1608915903!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit agreement explainer who got what","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDespite considerable joy on the part of Brexiteers, the agreement has left Britain  with a significantly weaker economic relationship with the EU.

But Boris Johnson’s assertion that the deal also eliminates non-tariff barriers to trade is not accurate.The two sides have agreed to introduce trusted trader schemes and self-verification systems to reduce the impact of the hard customs and regulatory border that will apply to all parts of the United Kingdom except Northern Ireland from January 1st. But there will still be checks and increased bureaucracy which will make trade costlier and more cumbersome and British produce authorisations will no longer be automatically accepted by EU regulators.Level playing fieldIn return for tariff-free, quota-free access to its single market, the EU demanded that Britain should make binding commitments to ensuring fair competition in employment rights, environmental standards and state aid, or subsidies. Britain initially rejected the concept of such level-playing field provisions out of hand, arguing that a central purpose of Brexit is to escape from the EU’s regulatory orbit.The agreement respects British sovereignty insofar as it will not have to follow EU rules, it will have its own independent state aid regulator, and it will not be subject to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). But Britain has committed to establish its state aid regulator under terms agreed with the EU and to keep its subsidy policy within agreed parameters. It must maintain its current environmental and labour standards and if either side improves those standards so that a competitive gap emerges, they can go to arbitration and possibly impose retaliatory tariffs.ServicesServices account for 80 per cent of the British economy and almost half of its total exports, but the deal has little to offer on financial or professional services. Both sides have agreed to support enhanced co-operation on financial oversight with a memorandum of understanding due in March.But there is no agreement on equivalence, which would allow British financial services firms to sell into the EU and vice-versa. Decisions on equivalence will be made unilaterally by each side, creating a more unstable environment.Britain also failed to persuade the EU to automatically recognise British professional qualifications. From now on, British lawyers, doctors, nurses, engineers, architects and others will have to seek recognition in each member state in which they wish to operate.FisheriesFishing was among the most contentious issues in the negotiations, the last to be agreed and the only one where Britain was clearly in the stronger position. But the outcome involved a huge climbdown for Johnson, who until a few weeks ago was demanding an 80 per cent reduction over three years in the value of fish caught in British waters.The EU’s opening demand for no change in its current access to British waters was plainly unrealistic but under the deal, European boats will lose only 25 per cent of their catch, with the changes phased in over 5½ years.After that, quotas for EU boats will be worked out in annual negotiations but if Britain dramatically limits access to its waters, the EU can retaliate by closing EU waters to British boats or imposing tariffs. The bloc dropped a demand that it should be able to impose sanctions on other elements of British trade in response to any dispute over fisheries.SecurityBritain is leaving the European Arrest Warrant and will no longer have access to Schengen databases that play an important role in police and judicial co-operation. British authorities will still have access to Passenger Name Record and Prüm DNA and fingerprint data.Britain will have partnerships with Europol and Eurojust but will lose some of the advantages of full membership in terms of data access. In an important compromise, Britain has agreed to remain subject to the European Convention of Human Rights for now and if that changes, the EU can suspend the security cooperation agreement.Both sides have agreed to maintain high standards of data protection with a view to each recognising the other in terms of data adequacy and a temporary arrangement will ensure continued data flows for up to six months. The ECJ has ruled that British laws giving its intelligence and security services access to personal data are in breach of EU law so any decision to grant Britain data adequacy could face legal challenge.Dispute resolutionEither side can impose tariffs on the other in specific areas if they believe the agreement is being breached. And if the other side believes the tariffs are unfair, they can go to an arbitration panel which will be independent and has no role for the ECJ.Inidual parts of the agreement can be renegotiated to deal with disputes and the entire trade deal can be revoked if the two sides fall out very badly, although the security agreement would remain in place.The agreement has a single, overarching structure, which means that it can be built on if a future British government seeks a closer relationship with the EU.Other issuesBritain will no longer have access to the EU’s internal energy market but new trading arrangements will be introduced to ensure trading on interconnectors is smooth and the agreement includes guarantees of security of energy supply.Britain will leave the Erasmus student exchange scheme, which Johnson described as “very expensive” and will introduce its own scheme named after the computer scientist Alan Turing. It will remain part of the Horizon Europe scientific research initiative.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Martin DivisekEPA.Europe begins a cross-border vaccination programme of unprecedented scale on Sunday as part of efforts to end a Covid-19 pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives around the world.The first doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine were delivered to EU member states on Saturday, while the region of 450 million people has also secured contracts with a range of other suppliers for over two billion vaccine doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated during 2021.The next vaccine set for approval by the EU is the Moderna vaccine, with authorisation expected on January 6th. After that, the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, which is considerably easier to administer as it does not require very cold storage as is the case with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs, is expected to get EU approval in erly January.However, it has been reported that the UK regulator could approve the OxfordAstraZeneca jab within days.The boss of the firm behind the OxfordAstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has also raised hopes it is more effective than first thought amid the rapid spread of the UK virus strain across the globe.AstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot told the Sunday Times he believed researchers had found the “winning formula” using two doses and promised to publish the results as reports suggested the UK regulator could approve the jab within days.The claim will come as some relief even as Canada became the latest country to identify cases of the new highly infectious variant of coronavirus, which was first detected in the UK and has since spread to at least a dozen countries.Cases of the variant strain have been confirmed across Europe including in France, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Iceland, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands, as well as around the globe in Australia, Japan and Lebanon.The new variant, which was blamed for soaring rates across the UK before the wider imposition of tighter restrictions, continues to drive high case rates in the UK with another 34,693 reported on Saturday.Turning the pageWhile Europe has some of the best-resourced healthcare systems in the world, the sheer scale of the effort means that some countries are calling on retired medics to help out while others have loosened rules for who is allowed to give the injections.With surveys pointing to high levels of hesitancy towards the vaccine in countries from France to Poland, leaders of the 27-country European Union are promoting it as the best chance of getting back to something like normal life next year.“We are starting to turn the page on a difficult year,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the Brussels-based European Commission coordinating the programme, said in a tweet.“Vaccination is the lasting way out of the pandemic.”After European governments were criticised for failing to work together to counter the spread of the virus in early 2020, the goal this time is to ensure that there is equal access to the vaccines across the entire region.But even then, Hungary on Saturday jumped the gun on the official roll-out by starting to administer shots of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to frontline workers at hospitals in the capital Budapest.Countries including France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Spain are planning to begin mass vaccinations, starting with health workers on Sunday. Outside the EU, Britain, Switzerland and Serbia have already started in recent weeks.The distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot presents tough challenges. The vaccine uses new mRNA technology and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of around -80 degrees Celsius .Shipments arriveIn Ireland the first shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has arrived.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the country would begin its vaccination programme next Wednesday, with frontline healthcare workers and nursi ng-home residents first in line to get the jab.“After a difficult and different Christmas for many people, it is wonderful to see the first deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines to Ireland today,” said Mr Donnelly. “The arrival of these vaccines . . . is a significant and positive” he added.He said the recent increase in cases had focused “our collective minds on the continued challenge of Covid-19” and said the advent of “safe and effective vaccines will help us to protect the most vulnerable in our society as we ramp up our immunisation programme”.Saturday marks the second day in a row that the number of daily infections climbed above the 1,000 mark. Before this week, the daily figure had not been above 1,000 since October 25th. There have been 2,200 deaths as a result of the pandemic and 85,394 confirmed cases of the disease in the Republic.France, which received its first shipment of the two-dose vaccine on Saturday, will start administering it in the greater Paris area and in the Burgundy-Franche-Comte region.Germany, meanwhile, said trucks were on their way to deliver the vaccine to care homes for the elderly, which are first in line to receive the vaccine on Sunday.Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres emptied by lockdown measures will become venues for mass inoculations.In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will spring up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring.In Spain, doses are being delivered by air to its island territories and the North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Portugal is establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira.“A window of hope has now opened, without forgetting that there is a very difficult fight ahead,” Portuguese Health Minister Marta Temido told reporters.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445865.1608983016!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first case of new covid 19 variant found in france as eu countries receive vaccine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first shipment of the PfizerBioNTech Covid-19 vaccines arrive in Spain. Photograph: EPA.France is the latest country to record its first case of the new variant of coronavirus, as EU countries received their first shipment of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine.The French health ministry said a Frenchman who recently arrived back in France from London had tested positive for the new variant of the coronavirus.The ministry said the case - the first in France - had been found in the city of Tours. The man in question arrived from London on December 19th. He was currently self-isolating and felt alright, the ministry added.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock had said on December 14th that a spike in Covid cases in the United Kingdom might have been linked to the new variant of the virus in the country.Mr Hancock said more than 1,000 cases of the new variant had been identified, mainly in southeastern England. Countries around the world have in recent days closed their borders to both Britain and South Africa following the identification of cases of the new, fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus in those countries.Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and Japan joined a growing number of countries that have identified their first cases of the coronavirus mutation, although there’s no clear evidence it results in more severe cases of the disease.VaccineMeanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines to the EU’s 27 members, but cautioned that immunisation will be a gradual process and care is still needed. “Once enough people have been vaccinated, we can start traveling, meeting our friends and family again and have normal holidays, which we all long for,” Ms von der Leyen said in a video message to mark what she called ‘Delivery Day.’ “But until then we have to continue being careful,” she added. “We have to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the virus.” EU nations will begin vaccinations on Sunday. The bloc has secured enough doses for its entire population of 450 million, and more vaccines will be rolled out “very soon” once they are proved to be safe and effective, Ms von der Leyen said. The premier of the German state of Bavaria asked citizens to be patient while waiting for a vaccine, saying the immunisation process will take a longer time. “Today, at least a small amount arrived in Bavaria, that provides hope,” Mr Soeder said in a tweet. “But because the quantities ordered only come gradually, it will take longer,” he said. “Therefore, patience is still required.”Turkey signed an agreement with Pfizer and BioNTech for 4.5 million doses of their vaccine, with an option to raise it to 30 million. Health minister Fahrettin Koca said Friday that an initial 550,000 doses will arrive by the year-end or in early January, state news agency Anadolu reported. Turkey made its first Covid-19 vaccine deal with Sinovac Biotech for 50 million doses, saying it found the Chinese vaccine to be the safest as it’s manufactured using conventional methods. However, the CoronaVac needs to be administered in two shots, which means the amount Turkey signed for will be enough only for 25 million of its citizens out of a population of more than 83 million people.AmericaThe US recorded 106,188 new Covid-19 cases on December 25th, an increase of just 0.6 per cent from the day before and the smallest daily gain since November 4th. However, the numbers were likely skewed by the Christmas holiday: The last time the daily rise was below 1 per cent was on Thanksgiving, and was preceded and followed by significantly larger jumps. ThailandThailand reported 110 new cases Saturday, most connected to a recent outbreak in Samut Sakhon province, the country’s seafood hub. Of the new 110 cases, 64 were transmitted locally, 30 were found among migrant workers and 16 were detected in state quarantine, according to the country’s Covid-19 centre. Thailand’s recent wave started with a record 576 new cases December 20th, mostly among workers at seafood markets, people who visited the markets or their close contacts. Seeking to limit the spread during the New Year’s holiday, the government on Thursday ided the country into zones based on risk and banned public gatherings in areas at the highest risk level.AustraliaAustralian authorities extended a lockdown for Sydney’s Northern Beaches until at least December 30th as a cluster of Covid-19 infections grows. Some 250,000 people in the area should remain at home except for essential medical care and provisions, but will be able to gather outside for exercise with five or 10 people depending on whether they’re in the worst-affected areas, the New South Wales state government said Saturday. Nine new cases were recorded overnight - with eight linked to the outbreak - taking the cluster’s total size to 116.Global cases of Covid-19 passed 79.8 million on St Stephen’s Day, while deaths hit 1.75 million.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445901.1609005304!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"congestion eases at uk border after thousands of drivers tested","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish army soldiers delivering Covid-19 tests to a lorry drivers on the M20 in Kent.

Some people will have parked up in Essex and will be looking at moving again.“Next week is a normal working week so I would expect the vehicles to increase then too. It’s not over yet and we will see what happens next.“I want to pass on a thank you to everyone who has helped look after the drivers by giving them food – a lot of people have done a lot of hard work, and it’s really good to see so many people helping.”Volunteers – including iniduals from nearby communities, the Salvation Army, Muslim group Al-Khair Foundation, HM Coastguard and Kent County Council – have been delivering thousands of warm meals and water to the drivers. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4445883.1608996715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory eurosceptics run rule over brexit trade deal with eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRemoval of the union flag outside the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium. Boris Johnson told backbench MPs that the Christmas Eve pact is the right deal for the UK and EU. File photograph: PAConservative Eurosceptics are poring over the details of the Brexit trade agreement with the European Union as British prime minister Boris Johnson tried to persuade them it is the “right deal” for the nation.Scrutiny of the treaty began in earnest when the 1,246-page document was officially published on the morning of Boxing Day – less than a week before its implementation.It was quickly met with severe criticism from those working in the fishing industry who said they had been “sacrificed” in order to secure the deal with Brussels.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has accused the government of “selling out” Scottish fishing with the Brexit deal. “The fact that many predicted it, doesn’t make it any less galling. The Tories have sold out Scottish fishing all over again promises they knew couldn’t be delivered, duly broken.”Mr Johnson acknowledged to Tory MPs that “the devil is in the detail” but insisted it would stand up to inspection from the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteers.The group has convened a self-styled “star chamber” of lawyers led by veteran Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash to examine the full text ahead of a Commons vote. The senior Conservative backbencher said number 10 sent him the treaty by courier on Saturday morning and that his team are in “constant communication”.UK chief negotiator David Frost hailed the deal as beginning a “moment of national renewal” that he argued means the UK “sets its own laws again” by ensuring there is “no more role” for the ECJ.However, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation Barrie Deas accused Mr Johnson of having “bottled it” on fishing quotas to secure only “a fraction of what the UK has a right to under international law”.Mr Deas said the prime minister had “sacrificed” fishing to other priorities.“Lacking legal, moral or political negotiating leverage on fish, the EU made the whole trade deal contingent on a UK surrender on fisheries,” said Mr Deas.“The prime minister made the call and caved in on fish, despite the rhetoric and assurances that he would not do what Ted Heath did in 1973.”The share of fish in British waters that the UK can catch will rise from about half now to two-thirds by the end of the 5½ year transition.A senior member of the UK negotiating team defended the fishing compromise as a transition to a point of “full control over our waters” but acknowledged that London wanted the process to happen “faster”.Meanwhile, the EU’s 27 member states indicated they will within days give their formal backing to the deal, which covers about €730 billion of trade to allow goods to be sold without tariffs or quotas in the EU market. The extraordinary timing of the Christmas Eve deal forced politicians and officials in the UK and Brussels to tear up their plans.MPs and peers will be called back to Westminster on December 30th to vote on the deal.However, MEPs are not expected to approve it until the new year, meaning it will have to apply provisionally until they give it the green light.The agreement will almost certainly be passed by the British parliament, with Labour supporting it.‘Star chamber legal eagles’But Mr Johnson is keen to retain the support of the Eurosceptics on his benches who helped him reach number 10 and minimise any further rebellions from within his own party.On Saturday, Conservative former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told BBC Breakfast: “I very much hope this treaty stands up to scrutiny and I hope to be able to support it.”Mr Johnson had earlier messaged Tory MPs to recognise “the devil is in the detail” but that he believes the deal will survive “ruthless” scrutiny from the “star chamber legal eagles. I truly believe this is the right deal for the UK and the EU. We have delivered on every one of our manifesto commitments: control of money, borders, laws, fish and all the rest. But even more important, I believe we now have a basis for long-term friendship and partnership with the EU as sovereign equals.”Cabinet minister Michael Gove said the deal will create a new “special relationship” – a term usually used to refer to UK-US links – and end the “ugly” politics since the 2016 Brexit referendum.French Europe minister Clement Beaune said it was a “good agreement”. And he added that British food and industrial products entering the European single market after January 1st will not pay customs duties “but will have to meet all our standards . . . There is no country in the world that will be subject to as many export rules to us as the UK.”\u0026nbsp– PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Kena BetancurAFP via GettyThe US will require airline passengers from the UK to produce a negative Covid-19 test before their flight, in response to a new variant of coronavirus.It is the latest country to announce new travel restrictions because of the variant spreading in the UK and elsewhere.Airline passengers from the UK will need negative tests within three days of their trip and to provide the results to the airline, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.The agency said the order will come into effect on Monday.Airlines must deny boarding to any passenger who does not get a test, the CDC said.The agency said because of travel restrictions in place since March, air travel to the US from the UK is already down by 90 per cent.Last weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new variant of coronavirus seemed to spread more easily than earlier ones and was moving rapidly through England. Dozens of countries have since barred flights from the UK.But he stressed there is “no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness”, or that vaccines will be less effective against it.This week, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said three airlines with scheduled flights from London to New York — British Airways, Delta and Virgin Atlantic — had agreed to require passengers to take a test before they get on the plane.United Airlines on Thursday agreed to do the same for its flights to Newark, New Jersey.The UK has been under considerable pressure since the word of the new variant was made public. Some 40 countries imposed travel bans, leaving the nation increasingly isolated, after Mr Johnson warned that the new variant might be 70 per cent more contagiousFrance relaxed a coronavirus-related ban on trucks from Britain on Tuesday after a two-day standoff that stranded thousands of drivers and raised fears of Christmas food shortages in the UK.French authorities, who imposed the ban to try to protect the continent from the new variant, said delivery drivers could enter by ferry or tunnel provided they showed proof of a negative test. – APStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Oxford vaccine regulator must be given \u0026#39time to carry out its important work\u0026#39Comment: A Tier 1 Christmas isn\u0026#39t quite as wonderful as it soundsAre we heading for a third national lockdown, and when will Covid rules end?\u0026#39We\u0026#39ve left behind the children\u0026#39: the countries where schools have been closed the longest ‘Sunday is the most violent day of the week’: Covid leaves Colombia\u0026#39s children exposed to abuseStorm Bella: Weather warnings as gusts of 100mph and heavy rain batter UKLake District named best place to walk in BritainMargaret Thatcher wanted to overhaul \u0026#39non-democratic\u0026#39 European CommissionWith a glass of wine and Dad’s Army, how we stopped floods turning Christmas into a washoutComment: This Government\u0026#39s one-size-fits-all approach to Covid restrictions is no longer convincing\u0026#39In 11 days we lost nine of our residents\u0026#39: A care home manager on the cost of CovidQuarter of a million dollar reward offered over mysterious Christmas Day Nashville bombingThree people killed as gunman opens fire in Illinois bowling alleyCovid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Number of people sentenced for offences hits five-year-lowMrs Brown\u0026#39s Boys creator Brendan O\u0026#39Carroll \u0026#39sued by former co-star Gary Hollywood over discrimination claims\u0026#39Tory Brexiteers signal they could back deal after claiming victory over European Court of Justice roleNew Covid strain: how dangerous is it, and could it hamper a vaccine?

The official seized his phone and deleted all the communications with this newspaper.The Chinese state has little regard or respect for the Ewenki\u0027s culture and religious beliefs, which sit uncomfortably next to Communist Party uniformity.The customs of the indigenous people from the Siberian taiga have been eradicated after decades of poorly planned government policies in the name of \u0027poverty alleviation\u0027.Pressure from the state has made it almost impossible for people like the Suos to keep their traditions alive.At most, only a few dozen Ewenkis like the Suo family remain reindeer herders in the wilderness. The rest have been \u0027resettled\u0027 in modern housing as part of a tourist park, akin to a Disneyland attraction.Outside his hut, knee deep in a snow drift Mr Suo searches for his reindeer, last seen three weeks ago.“They don’t want to come back here – there’s little food left they’ve grazed it all,” he said, clutching a bag of store-bought soybean feed, a paltry substitute to the natural lichen reindeer eat.As nomads, Ewenkis used to move frequently to new areas abundant with food for their reindeer, pitching cone-shaped tents made of larch poles, birch bark and deer hide, before being split between modern-day Russia and China when borders were drawn.“These days we just shift a hundred metres here and there,” said Mr Suo.“It won’t take 20 years within 15 years, our traditions, language and culture will cease to exist,” his mother added later.For centuries, the Ewenkis hunted game for subsistence and relied on reindeer for milk and transport.One of the first blows came in the 1960s when Chinese authorities bought Ewenki reindeer as part of a nationwide collectivisation of agriculture.Ewenkis were allowed to manage them, but had to supply antlers – now belonging to the state – for traditional Chinese medicine. If an Ewenki fell short of the quota, the animals could be reallocated.Then, the state began separating Ewenki children from their parents, sending them to study Mandarin in schools across China and losing their native language, a spoken tongue with no written form. In 2010, Unesco classified the language as “severely endangered.”Mr Suo, forced to leave home at age 7, knows few Ewenki words. “For the first two years, I cried constantly,” he said.The Ewenki, lovers of nature who consider their reindeer part of the family, also believed in animism and shamanism, with influence from Russian Orthodox Christianity. Shamans, like Ms Suo’s grandmother, would sing traditional songs to summon reindeer and ward off misfortune, enveloping the mountains in sound.But “these days, we don’t hear anything,” said Ms Suo. The last shaman died in 1998.The sole vestige of Ewenki culture and identity disappeared in 2003 when the government confiscated guns and banned hunting. Some Ewenkis turned to alcohol or suicide in despair.Without guns, they struggled to protect reindeer from predators, like bears and wolves newborn calves were easily killed.

As a child, Ms Suo lost her father after Chinese guards shot him at the Russian border when they tried to cross and reunite with relatives.So they choose to keep a picture of former US president Barack Obama – like black people, the Suos say they identify with widespread discrimination.Hours away from the Suos live Ewenkis who have been forcibly resettled – now for the third time since the Communist Party came to power in 1949.  The most recent relocation in 2003 came as the hunting ban went into effect, plucking families out of nature and dropping them into a new development aimed at attracting tourists.The plan – justified as necessary social development for Ewenkis and environmental conservation of the Greater Hinggan range – has largely fallen flat, those at the New Aoluguya settlement told the .There, Ewenkis now craft traditional boots of deer hide or carve reindeer bone amulets for sale from their cottages as part of the tourism park entering a shop means wandering into their living rooms.A handful of the sixty Ewenki households in the settlement also advertise homestays.Reindeer, with their antlers sawed off and ears pierced with plastic ID tags, are paraded in small pens for tourists.A museum exhibit introduces Ewenki lieba, a traditional round loaf made with reindeer milk, but includes nothing of their history or culture.Many strain to make ends meet without being able to hunt and live off the land as their forebears did.“We live in these fancy homes, but we’re destitute,” one woman said. “Though as long as we don’t starve, it’s ok.”She might sell a couple of lieba each day at 30 yuan (£3.40) apiece. If she’s lucky, a tourist might buy a reindeer hide for 2,000 yuan (£225).But few visitors come – the nearest airport is 300 miles away – and much of the revenue that comes in goes to the state tourism company that operates the park.Chinese state media, however, frequently claim the Ewenki voluntarily lay down their guns and left the mountains for modern life, and tout the tourist project as a success.

The pandemic has changed my life remarkably little. My parents are long gone, my kids are grown up, I am used to working from home and I live right next to Hampstead Heath.So I have mainly observed the drama from the outside but have still been surprised by what the crisis has revealed about our country. Great events like the pandemic provide snapshots of illumination, highlighting how the national temperament has been evolving beneath the surface. They, therefore, also provide a kind of audit on the national self-image.And I’m sorry to say that we need to chuck out all those T-shirts and tea cups bearing the slogan “Keep Calm and Carry On”. I believe it was on Monday 20 April that it struck me most forcefully: that day, a grim milestone was reached, with 100 health and social care workers reported to have died from Covid-19 – and I was witnessing a national panic. I realised then that we can no longer do television news for grown-ups.For the preceding three weeks, I had been watching the same thing every night on the BBC Ten O’Clock News: here is a shocking statistic about Covid, here’s someone who died, here’s a sobbing relative or frontline hero telling you to stay at home, save lives and protect the NHS.The Government contributed to the emotionalism and infantilisation. Inexperienced ministers facing a largely hostile establishment in the aftermath of the polarising Brexit experience were in an unprecedented situation. But no serious attempt was made to explain the pandemic trade-offs or to create a national unity political truce of some kind. Instead, at a time when the public were prepared to cut them a lot of slack, they defensively failed to acknowledge obvious failures and talked robotically to us as if we were children deserving praise for staying at home.No doubt like many people, I have felt torn in recent months between thinking that we have overreacted to a relatively minor new infection that has overwhelmingly afflicted the very old – producing only a small blip in excess deaths – and feeling that there is no real alternative to the restrictions we have had to endure given the lack of spare capacity in our health system.And while I enjoy the luxury of irresponsible commentary, those in power have to take life and death decisions every day and it is in the nature of a transparent, modern welfare, democracy that we will try to tackle the pain and loss in front of our noses – even if it ends up creating even more pain and loss in the future.The two greatest forces in contemporary democracy are short-termism and “safetyism”. Democratic short-termism always prioritises the immediate danger over the potentially greater longer-term danger. And the reason why we are required to put our lives and living standards on hold to save the NHS, instead of it saving us, is that we have not been prepared to forgo sufficient current consumption to build in the spare capacity that our health system requires to ride out a crisis like this.The other main reason we have succumbed to emotionalism and not been able to conduct a rational cost-benefit debate about the crisis is because of the smothering effect of what the American writer Matthew Crawford calls safetyism. To invoke safety is to claim the high ground of public-spiritedness, and it becomes almost impossible to argue for any course of action that might in the short term reduce human welfare. This lies behind the sanctification of the NHS.We do, of course, place a value on life indeed, the NHS places a very specific value of £25,000 to £30,000 on one extra year of decent quality of life when deciding how to ration expensive therapies. Yet in the crisis, we have talked piously about every life being priceless. And safetyism feeds on itself, the safer a society becomes the lower the tolerance of premature death.My epiphany watching the BBC news in April bleeds into a wider point about power and authority in mature democratic societies. Compared with 50 years ago, power is far more constrained and tied down both politically, legally and psychologically. In normal times, that is a damn good thing, but in a crisis, not so much. Leaders have lost the habit of leading from the front and taking painful decisions that might mean a higher death-count in the short term. This is surely at least one of the reasons why more authoritarian Asian countries have managed the crisis better.Notwithstanding this argument, I am an optimist about the crisis. I think it has also revealed attractive features of modern Britain, the high level of volunteering and the inventiveness of our medical-scientific infrastructure for example.I have just written a book called Head, Hand, Heart about how we have allocated too much reward and prestige to the cluster of human aptitudes concerned with cognitive ability. So it was refreshing to see not only the “heart” work done in the public care economy, but also the key workers, mainly non-graduate “hand” workers, getting some of the recognition they deserve.I think we will emerge from the pandemic a more decent society, more aware of our inter-dependence. But we also need to learn some lessons about emotionalism in the public conversation and accepting that with democratic authority, as with everything else, it is horses for courses. What works in normal times may not be right for a crisis.David Goodhart is author of Head, Hand, Heart: The Struggle for Dignity and Status in the 21st Century (Allen Lane, £20).

Archaeologists also found remains of goats, pigs, fish and snails, illustrating a wide variety of food on sale. Human remains were also found, alongside the bones of a tiny dog, which archaeologists said was evidence of selective breeding for size.The site will be opened to the public in the near future, Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said on Saturday.

I know, it’s not very festive. Especially not in the middle of a global pandemic which has already claimed the lives of thousands. Add in the emergence of a mutant virus strain currently ripping through the country, that turned plans of seeing loved ones over the Christmas period to ashes, and, frankly, it is about as welcome as having being consigned to Santa’s naughty list. But it’s a subject that keeps nibbling around the edges of my brain, demanding attention.In a few months, I’ll walk out of the Scottish Parliament for the last time. Ten years of my life – and being a parliamentarian is your life, regularly derailing commitments to family and friends – over. It is natural to take stock, to smile at the wins, mourn the losses and fret over the ones that got away.And that’s how I feel about changing the law on assisted dying. We had an opportunity to do it at Holyrood, nearly six years ago now, when a tremendously brave MSP brought forward a private members’ bill. Diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and wishing greater control of her own death, Margo MacDonald passed away before the bill was introduced and a colleague brought it forward. In truth, it was flawed legislation and because the drafting was not all that it should have been, it was easier to strike down the text, rather than take on the difficult, emotional, conflicting subject matter.Indeed, the bill failed at the first hurdle, by a ratio of more than two to one, despite being a free vote with no party whipping its members. With me, it raised issues of faith and family (my sister is a doctor and made clear how much of an anathema helping people to die would be for her and close colleagues). Gut level unease overrode intellectual understanding of agency, and the unfairness of those with means having the choice to go abroad while those without being condemned to suffer.In a strange way it now feels like cowardice to have voted against, even though I know there was no way that particular bill, as drafted, would have survived the legislative process.And if I was genuinely torn at the time (it is one of only two votes I couldn’t sleep over, getting up to pace and worry through the night) then every life-change, new chapter and signpost since has pointed me in only one direction it is time to change the law to let people have more control over their end-of-life decisions, up to and including how and where we die, who is there and the pain relief and treatment options we choose.The intellectual arguments in favour of assisted dying remain the same. It is surely wrong that people who seek release are kept in pain that every eight days a terminally ill Briton travels to Switzerland to end their life that this route is only open to those with up to £10,000 to pay for it that even those with the means are often forced to make the journey earlier than they would choose in order to be strong enough to travel that 300 terminally ill people in the UK commit suicide each year to end their own suffering. Wrong, too, that in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, helping a terminally ill person to end their own life can carry a 14-year jail sentence, while in Scotland the same action opens the door to a culpable homicide charge.I don’t pretend this is easy – or that the intellectual arguments are all that there are to consider. But two things have tipped the balance for me.The first is going through the process of IVF. It may seem odd to say that medical intervention to help create life has hewn away inhibitions about a more planned or even medicalised end of life, but it has. The systems and processes of egg retrieval choosing donors through any number of characteristics from height to family medical history embryo implant and even being able to guarantee against twins, makes a mockery of the mystique of kismet surrounding birth. And if birth can be so demystified (for the over 50,000 people who undergo IVF treatments in the UK every single year) then what rule of fate exists for death and why is there such imbalance?The second is the diagnoses of a number of people very close to me with varying forms of dementia and watching the person that they were being consumed by a disease that strips them of themselves – their memory, relationships, personality and spark.Again, there is little to immediately link either cause with effect: those advocating for an assisted dying model are patently not talking about IVF issues nor are they suggesting that people with cognitive impairment – such as dementia – be included in the change of law. The campaigning organisation Dignity in Dying, which advocates for greater choice and control at the end of life, is absolutely clear that they are campaigning only for terminally ill, mentally cognitive adults to be allowed to end their life and aided in doing so. No assisted suicide for those who are not terminal no euthanasia where a doctor administers the fatal dose to their patient.But, for me, a tortuous clash of head and heart, faith and intellect, right to life versus injustice of suffering was finally resolved by living the science of birth and watching the degeneration of mind, each day.To have the body able and the mind slowly dissolve is one thing. For the mind to stay clear and the body to be crippled in a pain with no release, and certain knowledge of a slow death outcome, prescribed by the state, goes beyond conscience. The arguments against – protection of medics, protection against coercion – have evidently been resolved to the satisfaction of the 185 million people across half a dozen countries with access to assisted dying provisions and no buyer’s remorse.In ten years of elected politics, I have made more mistakes than I can ever hope to remember  some through overreach, some by omission, others by nothing more than blunder. But the mistake that eats away, demanding redress, is voting against assisted dying.  Sometimes, amid complex arguments and conflicting evidence, you know – simply know in the essence of your being – that something is plain wrong. It’s time to change the law.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"titanic judges notes revealed first time","story":"As one of history’s most enduring disasters, the sinking of the Titanic has inspired countless books analysing every conceivable detail.  However, the personal papers of the judge who conducted the original investigation just weeks later have always been beyond reach. Now Lord Mersey’s descendants have made them available for the first time for a forthcoming major documentary. The judge’s notes reveal his innermost thoughts as he listened to the testimonies of hundreds of witnesses. They show the extent to which he was disturbed by the Titanic’s lack of lifeboat drills and its failure to slow down, even though she was travelling at night and had received ice warnings from nearby vessels.The nearby freighter, SS Californian, did not hear Titanic’s distress calls because its wireless had been turned off for the night. When it was 19.5 miles north of Titanic’s position, it had earlier telegraphed warnings of an ice field, but the Titanic’s wireless radio operators - who worked for the Marconi Company and much of whose work involved relaying passengers’ messages - had even scolded them for interrupting them.In the documentary, titled Titanic’s Lost Evidence, the judge’s great-great grandson, Ned Bigham, the Fifth Viscount Mersey, opens up a box that had been tucked away in family archives for over a century. It holds the red leather-bound private journal that Lord Mersey kept with him throughout the inquiry scribbling observations and diagrams.But his private notes show that he had grave concern over why the Titanic’s engines had been steaming at near capacity, despite receiving warnings of dangerous icebergs that could rip a ship apart and why adequate lifeboat drills had not been carried out.Lord Mersey observed that ice warnings had reached the Titanic: “Two vessels informed her: icebergs, growlers, floes.” He sketched images, trying to picture icebergs that the Titanic would have seen before hitting a monstrous one some 60 feet high and 400 feet long.In one passage, he underlined the words “no reduction of speed”, adding: “Speed, 21 knots. And never reduced up to time of collision, notwithstanding wary that icebergs in vicinity and that she would be likely to meet them.”He added: “For example, he questions why the Titanic was going so fast, …why the lifeboat drill was cancelled, why only two boats were lowered half way in Southampton… Lord Mersey had a nautical background so, when he wrote down something that was questionable, we know that he was doing that from experience.”Historians have questioned why Captain Smith did not slow down, wondering whether the blame lay with one of the Titanic\u0027s most influential passengers, J. Bruce Ismay, chair of the White Star Line, Titanic’s owner, which did not want it to be late with the press waiting on the docks. The Titanic received specific ice warnings of danger, including one from the Baltic, another White Star ship. Captain Smith showed a paper-written “Marconigram to Ismay, who simply put it into his pocket.Lord Mersey realised the significance. Underlining the name ‘Ismay’, he wrote of “the Baltic message, which Ismay held onto for a while”.The Titanic had 20 lifeboats. At full capacity, they could hold just half of the 2,240 passengers.Lord Mersey’s notes show his concern that the Titanic crew may not have even been trained sufficiently in using those lifeboats.During the inquiry, a Titanic lookout named Archie Jewell testified that, although they tested lifeboats before leaving Southampton, only two boats were lowered and they were not even put into the water. “A boat drill at Southampton. Only two boats used for the drill,” Lord Mersey wrote. “This unusual.” Barely 700 people were eventually rescued in lifeboats.His inquiry led to crucial shipping industry changes across the globe, including more lifeboats for passenger ships and 24-hour radio communications.The documentary, titled Titanic’s Lost Evidence, airs on January 5 on Sky History. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"governments monolithic one size fits all approach covid restrictions","story":"Nearly a million Brits have now been vaccinated. As the weeks go by in the New Year, this number will grow, hopefully by the millions each week. As each person has their second jab, they will join a rapidly growing part of the population that, mercifully, is no longer spending every day fearful of catching Covid.Alongside this group, there are the many people who have already had the disease: over two million Brits with positive PCR test results, and millions more besides — the ONS has estimated that around one per cent of the English population each week for the past eight weeks has contracted Covid-19, adding up to another four million in the past two months alone. We can’t know the precise total of people in the UK who have already contracted, and recovered from, Covid but whether it is nearer 10 million or 20 million, it’s a huge group and many people know they belong to it.Of the nearly 80 million documented cases of Covid-19 worldwide, there have been a tiny number of documented examples of re-infection (websites that track the examples count less than 50) so although reinfection within this time period does seem to be possible, it appears to be very rare. Those who have had the disease have good grounds to presume they are not vulnerable in anything like the same way.Put together, how are these millions of people expected to behave? It is rarely discussed. The principle of “one rule for everybody” has become a sacred one: any discussion of schemes to offer targeted protection to more vulnerable groups while allowing the less vulnerable to resume their lives is hastily dismissed as reckless and unworkable. There’s a good dose of politics involved too – solidarity requires that “we’re all in it together”, and, in the dreadful phrase that has dominated this pandemic, a single rule for everyone is considered “good messaging”.But at some point this principle must break. With every million more vaccinations, the pressure for a more differentiated approach will increase, and soon enough it will start to seem illogical, even tyrannical, not to permit people within the population to behave differently.The emergence of the new, apparently more transmissible, strain and the accompanying surge of cases across the country might seem to make this idea less likely – we all just need to lock down until the worst of it passes, so the logic goes. But if the new strain really is that much harder to control, as the Government insists, the logic will start to go the other way.The aim of trying to suppress the virus across the entire public square, as opposed to preserving safe spaces within it, only makes any sense as long as that is a plausible goal. We know that lockdowns are enormously destructive, but as long as they demonstrably reduce the infection rate and save lives there is at least a case for them. If infections now continue to soar anyway, despite ongoing draconian restrictions, the benefit will be much harder to demonstrate. We know that the surge in cases in Kent took place throughout the last lockdown. Cancelling all of life in exchange for a still-increasing infection – just theoretically increasing less quickly – starts to seem like a much less convincing exchange.In this scenario, the focus will rightly shift to vaccinating vulnerable groups with utmost haste and providing properly safe ways for the vulnerable but not-yet-vaccinated to shelter during the remaining period until they can be protected. Lockdowns and universal edicts become less relevant: if people are following the rules but infections keep rising anyway, we need to adapt our approach, and we can’t all live in a bunker until the spring.We already have successful examples of a more differentiated policy. Take supermarkets. In the beginning of the first lockdown, shops began the habit of setting aside an hour at the start of each day, when everything had been cleaned, exclusively for vulnerable people to do their shopping. How much safer and more reassuring for those people to be in a controlled environment, than be thrown in with all the jostling schoolchildren, unfazed young people and mask refuseniks as they are today? Pretending that everyone obeys the rules to the same extent makes public spaces like these less safe, not more so, for people who have genuine cause to be worried. The same principle could be widely adapted: better to provide safe pathways than pretend the whole country is safe when it’s not.Conversely, are we going to continue to ban all gatherings, even of people who have been vaccinated or recovered? Are all those thousands of students who tested positive during the autumn to be forbidden from seeing each other for months more? As well as creating more genuinely safe spaces for vulnerable people, we can surely create spaces for non-vulnerable people to be together, in a way that doesn’t jeopardise anyone.As we enter what is hopefully the endgame of this pandemic, the Government has a choice: to continue with its devotion to monolithic, one-size-fits-all controls for as long as possible until discipline finally collapses completely, or to start allowing people to start making judgements based on their own particular circumstances, including vaccination status, prior infection and level of vulnerability. The concept of personal responsibility was taken away from people almost a year ago.

It will come into effect on January , , after the transition period ends. On Boxing Day, the draft version of the agreement was published, featuring details on what the future economic relationship will look like. Here are some of the key points, and what has been said about them: FishingThe UK gave ground on fisheries, Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted, but he said that as a result of the deal the country will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters and would see its share of UK fish rising substantially.The deal asserts the sovereign rights of EU states and the UK for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the living resources in their waters. What do you think of the deal  Let us know in the comments below Both sides can apply for licences to fish in the otheraposs waters and will lay out quotas each year for the amount of dferent fish which can be caught. If either side feels that the other is not complying with the rules they can suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters. The chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermenaposs Organisations said Mr Johnson had bottled it over fishing rights. Barrie Deas said after the document was published: When push came to shove, despite the legal, moral and political strength of our case, fishing was sacriced for other national objectives. Lacking legal, moral, or political negotiating leverage on fish, the EU made the whole trade deal contingent on a UK surrender on fisheries. Tarfs The deal is worth £ billion a year and will enable UK goods to be sold without tarfs or quotas in the EU market - allowing UK companies to do even more business with the continent, the Prime Minister said. The European Commission said the two sides had created an ambitious free trade area with no tarfs or quotas on products, regulatory and customs co-operation mechanisms. It said the deal has prevented restrictions such as % tarfs on meat and dairy products with World Trade Organisation rates.  A senior member of the UK negotiating team said tarfs can be imposed after arbitration in a limited number of areascompetitive ergence arises. If the mechanism is used too often or too long then a renegotiation of the relevant parts of the treaty is triggered, the official said. Level playing field Brussels said the agreement included binding enforcement and dispute settlement mechanisms which will ensure that rights of businesses, consumers and iniduals are respected, though Mr Johnson suggested the EU had made concessions on this area. The agreement talks about open and fair competition between the UK and EU, and an economic relationship that will be beneficialthe commitments relating to a level playing field for open and fair competition stand the test of time. Competition authorities on both sides shall endeavour to co-operate and co-ordinate and will be able to share information. Services The UK said there are unprecedented measures to allow UK solicitors, barristers and advocates to practise in the EU using their UK title, as well as a highly comprehensive deal in digital trade. State aid The deal ends the EU State Aid regime and allows the UK to introduce its own modern subsidy system so that we can better support businesses to grow and thrive, the UK said. Laws Mr Johnson said that after January , British laws will be made solely by the British Parliament interpreted by British judges sitting in UK courts and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will come to an end.  Transport The agreement provides for continued and sustainable air, road, rail and maritime connectivity, the European Commission said, with provisions to ensure passenger rights and transport safety are not undermined. Security The Prime Minister said he was absolutely confident the deal would protect police co-operation, the ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years. Students The UKaposs involvement in the EUaposs Erasmus student exchange programme will be be replaced by a worldwide scheme named after Bletchley Park code breaker Alan Turing.  Ministers have committed more than £ million on the replacement for   for around , students to go on placements from September under the Turing scheme. Healthcare The agreement will enable UK citizens to access healthcare when travelling in the EU, with reciprocal cover for EU member states which are responsible for the healthcare of an inidual, according to a UK Government summary. State pensions The agreement provides for the uprating of the UK state pension paid to pensioners who retire to the EU, the Government said.

An “independent” Britain will still face punitive sanctions from Brusselsit steps out of line on managing its own economy. And businesses trading with Europe are left facing costly extra red tape, customs checks and new formalities. The Prime Minister boasted his £billion Christmas Eve deal “takes back control” of our laws, borders and fisheries – with no tarfs or quotas on exports to the EU. He promised a “new relationship”, free of European single market rules on trade and with no political control from Brussels. But when the ,-page document was released, it revealed the UK will have to toe the Brussels line or face penalties on businesses and exporters.Marley Morris, of the IPPR think tank, said: “We can expect slower recovery from the coronavirus recession and higher prices in the shops.” Mr Johnson’s claim that he had “got Brexit done” was also exposed as a sham – when the documents revealed that the entire deal could be up for renegotiation in four years.The PM was accused by fishermen of “losing his bottle” in negotiations and “sacricing” the UK fishing industry because it accounts for just . per cent of the economy. Announcing the deal after almost  months of wrangling the PM said: “We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation. In a way that is complete and unfettered.” He admitted that “the devil is in the detail” but insisted: “I am sure this can survive the most ruthless scrutiny”. In fact,a future government tries to erge “signicantly” from EU standards on state aid to industry, it could be hauled before Partnership Councils of judges and trade experts. Disputes could include any relaxing of employment rights or environmental standards and,not settled, would be likely to see import tarfs imposed on any UK business deemed to have been given a competitive edge. That threat comes on top of increased bureaucracy and paperwork now facing all trade across the Channel – expected to add four per cent to firms’ administration costs. Britain had argued for trade to be as “frictionless” as possible, but the deal means signicant non-tarf barriers. Traders are busy working out the likely costs, amid fears jobs will be lost. The Partnership Councils will be permanently on watch, requiring a mirroring of the current bureaucracy for ministers and officials to keep in constant contact with Brussels. A spokesman for No said: “All trade dispute mechanisms are fully reciprocal. They cannot be used simply because one side does not like something the other side has done.” Another major win claimed by Mr Johnson was in freeing the UK from the European Court of Justice. The court is seen by lawyers as the last resort in holding the Government to account on human rights abuses. But under the deal a new body will be created which allows anybody to “lodge complaints” about the way they feel treated by the Government.  The Independent Monitoring Authority will have no authority over the British courts but will tie up officials and lawyers in expensive cases. Clement Beaune, France’s Minister for European Affairs, claimed the deal means there is “no country in the world that will be subject to as many export rules to us as the UK.” The end of free movement of financial services – worth £bn to the British economy – means City firms will have to comply with ying rules across dferent EU states. Banks must wait up to six months before they know whether they will be able to sell services to EU firms. Many are now braced for job losses – with uncertainty over the fallout lasting into the New Year. Details of the deal are being scrutinised by a “star chamber” of lawyers set up by the hardline Tory European Research Group of MPs, whose members are threatening a rebellion when the Commons debates the agreement on Wednesday. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said the PM’s move to allow the Commons and the Lords just one day to debate it is “clearly not enough”. He warned that the detail required close attention because “the EU has a habit of inserting little quirks”. Labour leader Keir Starmer faces his own revolt from Remain MPs, and threats of frontbench resignations over his demand they support what he called a “thin” deal – but which he insisted was better than no deal.He aims to persuade them it has so many holes that a Labour government could use it to improve rights at work and laws on climate change.

They have pledged to fund the programme at a cost of around €.ma year. Erasmus enables third level students to study for part or all of their degree in another EU member state or undertake a work placement abroad, with their fees and costs paid. The exchanges usually take place during the second or third year of a course and can last up to  months. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below Around , British students annually are said to study in the Erasmus scheme, which the UK joined in  to allow students to study and work across Europe. Last year  students and staff from Norhern Ireland took part, reports RTE. In April last year, the Irish Government decided that arrangements should be made to enable students of relevant institutions in Northern Ireland to have continued access to the programme. For students in Great Britain it will be replaced by the aposTuring schemeapos - at a cost to the government of £m. The Department of Educationsaid the Turing scheme will provide funding for around , students to go on placements around the world from September. The DfE said the scheme named after Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing will cost £ million in   but that funding for subsequent academic years will be set out in future spending reviews.The Governmentaposs decision to end involvement in the European Union scheme has proved controversial, particularly as Boris Johnson previously said Brexit did not threaten participation.But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: We now have the chance to expand opportunities to study abroad and see more students from all backgrounds benefit from the experience.  We have designed a truly international scheme which is focused on our priorities, delivers real value for money and forms an important part of our promise to level up the United Kingdom. The DfE said the new scheme will be targeted at students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Prime Minister told MPs in January that there was no threat to the Erasmus scheme and we will continue to participate in it. But after successfully negotiating a trade deal with Brussels, Mr Johnson said that he had taken the tough decision to pull out of the scheme for financial reasons.In response, SNP MP Douglas Chapman accused the Prime Minister of lies and bluster.A senior member of the UK negotiating team earlier said that remaining in Erasmus would have cost in the hundreds of millions each year. That was a signicant cost and we believe we can achieve something better, still allowing exchanges to Europe but allows exchanges around the world as well, the official said. Thataposs why that particular decision was taken and we believe itaposs still going to offer huge opportunities for British students to study around the world in the future.

The government has reportedly set a target of m vaccinations, with either the Oxford or Pfizer jab, within a fortnight. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be approved by regulators within days, paving the way for mass vaccination centres at sports stadia and conference venues to open next month. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which is already being deployed, it can be stored in a standard fridge rather than at -C. Several million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been manufactured and are ready to be deployed, reports The Sunday Telegrpah. The government has ordered  million jabs, with most expected to be rolled out by March. What do you think  Let us know in the comments section below The Oxford vaccine is much simpler to distribute in large quantities because itaposs easier to store and handle. We are deploying as fast as we get the stuff in,” a Whitehall insider reportedly told the paper. “The constraint is supply, not deployment. The protocol around Pfizer is really dficult, but with AstraZeneca it’s much easier, it’s like the flu vaccine. Speaking last week, the lead researcher at Oxford University, Professor Sarah Gilbert, said: “The regulators have to be given their time but I really hope that the moment isn’t too far off.” Scientists at Oxford University spent months working on the vaccine. And ministers have given £million since March to help accelerate the project. However the rollout could turn into a PPE-style fiasco, MPs, doctors and care chiefs have been warned in the Sunday Mirror. Vaccine appointments for the most vulnerable are being cancelled at the last minute because of the delay, doctors say. And , of the country’s , care homes are not even being considered for jabs right now – with only seven areas of England getting them so far. Health leaders have also raised concerns many frontline NHS staff are still not being sent for jabs.

James Connelly, , spent more than two weeks in a coma and was evacuated by air ambulance from Rhodes after his parachute rope snapped in high winds. He was tethered to brother Mikey, , and cousin Jessica Hayes, , who died when the trio crashed into the rocky coastline. For more than two months James has been fighting for le in John Radclfe Hospital, Oxford. But this week the brave schoolboy was allowed home to spend the festive season with his parents, Philip and Sharon. Tonight Jessica’s father, Tony Hayes, said: “As a family we have had a little Christmas present. James has been allowed tohome and will continue his rehabilitation from there.” James suffered a broken knee and head injuries in the accident. Tony added: “He has a long road ahead. His mum and dad have only had two nights at home in two months, they are exhausted. His rehabilitation is their number one focus.” Tony’s world was torn apart by the accident on October  and he is suffering PTSD after having to identy his daughter’s body.  He fears the trio were taken out on the trip despite bad weather as the parasailing firm sought to recoup losses from coronavirus.Dad Tony wants justice and is waiting for a decision by Greek authorities on whether it was legal to allow three children to fly on a parachute. Tony, , said: “I’m angry but sometimes there are feelings of guilt for not being there. Every day is so dficult. “A legal case can take years but we want justice for the children. We want to ensure nothing like this happens again. We will never get over it. If the law has been broken then we want criminal charges brought.” Teacher Tony, from Corby, Northants, went away with his we Kayleigh, , and their two children to celebrate the th birthday of Kayleigh’s father Phil. They were joined by Kayleigh’s brother Phillip Connelly and his we Sharon, the parents of James and Mikey.  Jessica, Mikey and James had played boules, cards and watched bands in the hotel. Jessica had told her parents it was “the best holiday she’d ever had”. They booked the € parasailing trip after seeing an advert on the hotel’s website. Mikey had “always wanted” to try it and Tony waved them off at .pm on the beach by their four star Lindos Princess Beach Hotel. A storm began after the speedboat set off and it was seen chasing after the trio after the rope snapped and their chute veered toward the rocky coastline. Kayleigh, who stayed on the beach, rang Tony to say: “The boat’s come back and they’re not on it. We’ve been told there’s been a terrible accident.” Just after pm they heard Jessica and Mikey had died. Boat operator Nikkos Mallios, , who runs Lindos Watersports Center, was arrested and bailed as prosecutors decide whether he should face manslaughter charges.

The Times reports as many as , brave volunteers will step forward to be deliberately infected with the virus after being given an experimental nasal vaccine, in order to speed up research.Volunteers will be aged between  and , said Imperial College London, one of the partners in the study, with  participants beginning in January next year and results expected by May. One volunteer told the Times: If I die, better to die gloriously. Would you sign up for the trials  Have your say in the comments below While Alastair Fraser-Urquhart, , of Stoke-on-Trent, previously told Radio  that he signed up for the trials to bring the world out of the pandemic sooner and save thousands of lives. Speaking to BBC Radio , he said he had been told he was to be locked up in the clinic for at least a fortnight as researchers monitored his bodyaposs response. He said: Iaposll be remaining at the clinic, really, for as long as it takes. Obviously we canapost have it infecting anyone who isnapost a part of the trial, so every volunteer would need to be held in bio-containment. He added: It was just something that made instant sense to me, really. While -year-old Jenner Wright told the paper she was very sure that I would like to take a risk to help out. Some of my friends work for the NHS and theyaposve been taking risks all through the pandemic while Iaposve been looked after and stayed safe, she said. Human challenge studies are rarely undertaken as there are ethical questions around deliberately infecting people with viruses. But there are reportedly thousands of Brits willing to volunteer for the trials and be given the bug in a in a apossecure bio-containment suiteapos, reports the Times. The Government announced the project in October, stating the aim is to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause a person to develop Covid- infection. It added: This is known as a virus characterisation study and will be backed by £. million of government investment. Teaching hospital the Royal Free Hospital in Camden, London, is Imperialaposs partner in the study, along with clinical company hVIVO, which has pioneered viral human challenge trials. Royal Freeaposs specialist diseases clinic will be used to house the volunteers for two to three weeks and provide a safe environment insuring the virus cannot break out. Volunteers will be paid £,, according to Mail Online.Immune responses samples will then be sent to the Ministry of Defence laboratory at Porton Down to be tested. Participants deliberately infected will then be monitored  hours a day for three weeks. The drug remdesivir will be given as soon as even mild symptoms occur. Back in October, Professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London said he had hoped we will be seeing some results of some phase three trials on one or more of the vaccines within the next few months I hope this side of Christmas. While Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said in October: “A safe, fully approved, and meticulously controlled human challenge model for Covid- that is conducted by experienced experts may help in the search for safe and effective vaccines. “First, for the many vaccines still in the mid-stages of development, human challenge studies may help pick out the most promising ones to take forward into larger Phase III trials.  “Second, for vaccines which are in the late stages of development and already proven to be safe and effective through Phase III studies, human challenge studies could help us further understandthe vaccines prevent transmission as well as preventing illness.” Challenge trials have a long history dating back to , when the vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner inoculated eight-year-old James Phipps with live cowpox virus. More recently, they have been instrumental in developing vaccines and treatments for typhoid, cholera and malaria. Normally trials enrol thousands of participants and wait for a minority to naturally contract a disease. However this means such phase  trials can take months or even years as they wait for participants to fall ill in sufficient numbers. Volunteers will be monitored for up to a year after participating. Royal Free released research on December  which stated that Covid- immunity for those who had a mild version of the disease lasts at least four months.

As we prepare to leave  behind , many people will be planning firework displays. Itaposs not a year any of us have enjoyed and we are extraordinarily glad to leave it behind. Butyou are planning to set off some fireworks, spare a thought for your four-legged friends, who would rather you didnapost. If youaposre a dog owner, you know how much of a pain it can be. Here are some top tips to help your beloved pooch get through it from Tractive and dog trainer Oli Juste. . Spot the signs: Learn to recognise what stress in your dog looks like, so you know that they are anxious. Common signs include pacing, hiding under the bed, trying to climb on you and peeing or pooing when fireworks go off. But it can be less obvious, for example, panting, yawning, licking their nose and lips, or ‘whale eye’ - that’s when the whites of their eyes look like a crescent moon. . Distract them: Stay calm and reassure your dog during the fireworks. Try to distract them with something they like. Research shows dogs that regularly play with people are less anxious. Whatever you do, don’t ignore your dog. . Create a safe place: This could be a crate, a spot under your bed, a corridor without windows.

The white washed walls of the farm house are famous because the property lies slap bang in the middle of the busy M motorway. Just before it appears the two carriageways separate to reveal fields and the home standing proudly on its own in one of the most unusual locations in the country. The motorway, which links Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, is one of the busiest in the country, then merges once again a few miles past the house. Over the years since the M was built in the s, a raft of rumours and urban myths have sprung up as to why Stott Hall Farm stands prouly where it is. It is a commonly held belief that the farmer who owned the property when the motorway was built, Ken Wild, had refused to sell his house and land when plans for the six lane M were approved. Planners are then said to have found a way around the issue by simply building the motorway around his farm. But Ken, who lived in Stott Hall Farm with his we, Beth, and their flock of sheep, wasnapost quite the rebel everyone assumes him to be.  A documentary, filmed almost  years after the motorway was completed, has revealed the truth about why the farm is in the middle of a motorway. Filmed in  and released a few years ago by the British Film Institute , Cleggaposs People explains why the road could never have been built on the farm. Journalist Michael Clegg explains: A geological fault beneath the farmhouse meant it was more practical for engineers to leave it rather than blast through and destroy it.  Outside the noise is relentless but inside it’s as peaceful and cosy as any farmhouse. Ken and his we Beth had moved into the farmhouse in  and always insisted the motorway didnapost bother them. Although Beth did admit it made cleaning harder as the sheer number of cars speeding by meant it could get very dusty. Heartbreakingly though, the couple did witness a few fatal crashes while they were living on the farm.  But the nearest they came to disaster was .am one morning when a ft lorry ended up overturned in their yard. Beth explained: “The driver climbed out through the windscreen. He wasn’t hurt at all. Eleven years ago, Jill Falkingham bought the house along with her husband Phil, and the couple moved in with their son, John-William.

So let’s be reasonable, and say: “OH MY GOD, THESE MANIACS ARE SO INCOMPETENT THEY’VE TURNED BRITAIN INTO A BLOODY LEPER COLONY.” I know the virus is a global problem, but we’re the only place that’s had to be cut off from everywhere. By next year we’ll watch I’m a Celebrity with someone from Emmerdale eating cockroaches, and think: “Why do they get posh treats like that  It’s all right for them, I’ve only eaten a flea since Tuesday.” Nigella Lawson’s next series will start with her purring: “Hmmm, look what I found, a fresh mouse.

You’d think this would have pleased the Conservative Brexit supporters as they’ve spent  years screaming: “We want to be cut off from Europe, we’re sick of Europe – for God’s sake cut us off from Europe.”But while we were cut off from Europe, the Conservatives were yelling: “How DARE Europe cut us off  Connect up with us again so we can scream at how we want to be cut off from you, you French pigs.” Our rates of infection are among the worst in the world, and our economy has suffered as badly. So the Government responds by claiming we’re the “best in the world” and Priti Patel announces we’re “ahead of the curve”. This is the strategy now. Rishi Sunak will claim he won the world snooker championship, and Michael Gove will say: “I won first prize at Crufts this morning.” Then it will turn out he did actually enter but came last after he pooped in the judge’s picnic hamper and tried to hump the Marquess of Argyll.

Earlier this year the Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally announced they were quitting as senior members of the royal family. They said they wished to split their time between the UK and the US but the Covid pandemic has kept them in Calornia, where they moved after their exit was secured. The couple were said to have been offended when they were missing from family photos on the Queen’s desk during her  address. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below. And this year, the couple, along with scandal-hit Prince Andrew, were missing from the video montage round-up of royal events. Footage of senior royals, including Prince William and Kate at work during the pandemic, was screened to millions in the traditional speech. Her Majesty included images from Kate’s Hold Still Covid- picture project.There was also footage from International Nurses Day with Edward and Sophie Wessex, and a focus on the engagements carried out by Prince Charles and Camilla. Many of these included virtual exchanges as they had taken place during the lockdowns. The Queen featured herself in several clips — including alongside daughter Princess Anne in a call to the Carers Trust. In her annual televised speech, the Queen paid tribute to the kindness of strangers whose actions have inspired all and, sounding a positive note, said even the darkest nights have a promise of a new dawn. The Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs Christmas card this year shows Meghan, Harry and son Archie in a stylised image sitting in front of a Wendy house, thought to be at their Calornian home, with their pet dogs. The card was sent to the animal welfare charity Mayhew that the duchess supports as patron, which tweeted the image and a thank you for an undisclosed personal donation from the royals.  The image is from a photograph taken by Meghanaposs mother Doria Ragland, and a tiny Christmas tree in the picture is decorated with ornaments selected by the coupleaposs -month-old son. Meghanaposs message in the card read: This year we, as a family, have made donations to several charities with you in mind.

As I write this, the news comes that our new, more transmissible, strain of coronavirus has  mutations in its genetic code. British Covid- has essentially made us pariahs, so we’re banned from travelling to most countries in the world. It’s dficult to find the right words to sum up the state we find ourselves in. Who is to blame  It’s easy to point at Boris Johnson – and, personally, I’d happily aim my middle finger in his direction. He and his cronies have shambolically mishandled the attempt to free our once great nation of this dreadful disease. They have had us all doing what has effectively been a nonsensical hokey cokey of lockdown rules. But in truth, so many people in power are at fault – from Wuhan in China, where the virus was reported to have originated late last year, to world leaders everywhere who didn’t take it seriously enough to warn us how deadly and destructive it would be. The terrible consequences of Covid could so easily have been avoided had we had someone in charge like New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern, who has saved her own country from disaster.From small businesses to high street chains, many of which have been forced to close, few have escaped unscathed.If the year  has taught us anything, it’s that the world can come crashing down around usat any time.As social media sites encouraged us to make our lives appear glamorous and desirable, we posted pictures of everything from the places we visited to the dinners we cooked – in an attempt to show how we were having it all. But one global pandemic has pressed a giant re-set button on what became the modern-day version of that s’ classic phrase, “Greed is good”. So many of us have lost what we were hanging on to – an illusion thatwe made it look perfect, it would be perfect. Now though, legions of us are unemployed and unable to see the ones we love. Others are mourning those they lost – and couldn’t even be with in their final moments.

The -year-old, who already had two convictions for drink-driving, fled the scene but was later jailed for seven years. Beauty therapist Lauren, was ing from her first late sht following a promotion at a spa in Center Parcs when she was struck on the A in Suffolk. Now Claire, , has spoken out at Christmas to reveal the terrible toll Laurenaposs death took on the family. This month Claire, from Soham in Cambridge, said: Being told our daughter was dead was like dropping a bomb and blowing our lives into pieces. The pain is unimaginable and there is nothing that will fix it. “We think about Lauren every day and have many wonderful memories. But there are so many more we won’t get to have. We won’t see her get married, she will never have children. We don’t even know what she would look like now. “What happened that night haunts us every day. Please don’t be the cause of another family’s tragedy. Please don’t drink and drive.” Lauren was killed in November , on the A in at Red Lodge in Suffolk. Her dad Robert stumbled on the crash scene after he went out to look for her, having grown increasingly concerned when she failed toto her home in Soham. Devastated Robert phoned his we Claire to tell her “Lauren’s been killed in a car crash as another driver fled the scene. Claire slept on the floor beside her daughteraposs coffin the night before the funeral, as the devastated family, including dad Robert and brothers Kieran, Bobby and Jayden, brought her into the house for a heartbreaking vigil. “I just wanted the six of us to be together again for one last time,” said Claire at the time. “My heart broke again, watching the boys talking to their sister, in her casket.”  The next day, a horse and carriage carried her coffin to the funeral at St Andrewaposs church in Soham, where ‘Let It Go’ from Disney’s Frozen – her favourite song – was played. “Instead of planning for my daughter’s future wedding, I’d been making arrangements for her funeral,” said Claire. Curtis, from Lakenheath, Suffolk, had crashed into Laurenaposs Citroen at mph, losing a wheel in the process but driving on for another two miles. It later emerged he was convicted for dangerous driving and drink driving back in , when he was fined and banned for two years. His second two-year driving ban came in , when he was again convicted of drink driving.  On the day she was killed, Claire had been to a yoga class with her daughter followed by coffee. Lauren, who Claire described as her “best friend”, had also painted her mum’s nails baby pink as a favour. Claire had then waved her off for her sht. She said: “Hard working and popular, we were always so proud of Lauren. We knew she’d go far.” Also steadfastly reliable, Robert, who ran a construction business with Claire’s help, started fretting when it reached .pm -  minutes after the end of Laurenaposs sht - and they had not heard from her. “I remember Robert saying, ‘It’s not like her not to call,’” Claire said, who, finding her daughter’s line dead, sent her a text, saying, ‘Just seeing you’re ok. Ring me, sweetie.’  Fearing she had run out of petrol, or had a flat tyre, Robert went out to look for her. After  minutes, he phoned home, telling Claire to ask her parents to look after the boys, so she could drive down to the Barton Mills roundabout of the A, as Lauren had been in a crash. But, just minutes later, he called again, telling her to stay put, as he was coming home. Her parents, Vanessa and Terry, arrived from their nearby house and Claire waited at the end of the drive, as a police car drove towards her. “When I saw Robert’s face, as he got out of the car and walked towards me, his eyes red raw, my heart was sliced in two,” she said.  “Holding my hands tight, he said, ‘Lauren’s been killed in a car crash.’ “‘No!’ I howled. ‘Not my Lauren,’ as we both sobbed, uncontrollably.” The police then told them they were hunting another car, as only Lauren’s vehicle had been found at the scene. “I broke the news to Lauren’s brothers that she was dead the next morning,” Claire continued, adding that the police also called saying they had arrested a man. “Seeing their pain made my own heartache even worse.” Identying her body later that day at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmonds, Claire said Lauren looked like she was sleeping.  “Letting go was so very hard,” she recalled. “Sitting with her every day, I’d talk to her, twiddling her beautul blonde hair and playing her favourite music. I just wanted her to come home, but she never would.” After two weeks, Lauren’s body was transferred to Soham’s chapel of rest, where Claire would sit all day – only leaving to meet her sons after school. She continued: “Robert and I wouldto say goodnight in our pyjamas, once the boys were in bed.” Placing a single pink rose and a small tea light in Lauren’s hand, before they closed the casket, so she would not be alone in the dark, the night before the funeral, they brought the coffin back to their house. Claire is now an ambassador for the Road Victims Trust, a charity that supports victims of fatal and le-changing road collisions across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.

But one good thing has come out of Iris Jones’ heartache – she will get to enjoy the festive season with her sons. Iris, , became the talk of the nation when the Sunday Mirror revealed details of her explosive sex le with Mohamed Ahmed, . She went on to stun Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on ITV’s This Morning by recalling how Mohamed left her “saddle sore” after a recent holiday. But speaking so openly about her love le ruined the relationship she had with her sons Stephen, , and Darren, . Stephen has previously said it “caused a lot of friction” in the family – but they have now put their dferences aside so Iris didn’t have to spend Christmas Day alone. Iris, who married Mohamed last month, said: “My boys are now accepting of the fact that this is genuine. We genuinely love one another. I will be spending Christmas with Stephen, his we and my step-children. But I will still be wearing a mask and not touching any surfaces. I don’t want to be on my own.” Iris, who has been orced for  years, started chatting to Mohamed on Facebook last summer. They met for the first time in November  and have been together ever since – but Mohamed has so far failed to secure the necessary paperwork to move to the UK. Iris did not speak to her new love on Christmas Day “because he is a Muslim and he doesn’t celebrate it”. But she revealed the pair talk every day and admitted she is still taken aback by her feelings for Mohamed. Iris said: “I didn’t think this would happen at my age – falling so deeply in love with someone half my age – but you can’t help who you fall in love with. Age is of no relevance whatsoever. I go from being so happy when we’re together to the absolute depths of misery when we’re apart.”  Iris and Mohamed’s Cairo wedding was very low-key. Instead of opting for a traditional ceremony, they just signed the papers to make things official then celebrated with fried chicken at the local KFC. But since herto the UK on December , Iris has been missing Mohamed terribly. “It’s very, very, very dficult,” she said. “I lived with him for three months in Egypt. But I can’t go over there again – the heat is not good for my health.

This comes as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex land big-money deals with TV giant Netflix and music-streaming service Spoty - upon which they will be launching a podcast. The couple now reside in Calornia after announcing their intention to forge their own path away from the British Royal Family.What is your view  Have your say in the comments section below However, their current deal with Buckingham Palace expires on March . Under the current dealt, they still have their royal patronages - something they are said to be keen to keep. But the Sun reports royal aides will be looking in-depth at the coupleaposs Netflix and Spoty deals to seethey are in line with the Queenaposs values. While the pair are expected to speak with senior royals next month via video chat, before Harry s to the UK for face-to-face talks, possibly accompanied by his we. Last Januaryaposs Sandringham summit was more of a tense and confrontational affair than what is expected early next year, as Harry looks to broken an extension to the arrangement despite the couple landing Netflix and Spoty deals worth £million and £million respectively.Sources reportedly said that Harry and Meghanaposs royal patronages hang in the balance, while Harry’s military roles which were stripped from him due in the Megxit arrangement have still not been filled.It was reported earlier this month how princes Harry and William exchanged Christmas presents and agreed a apostruceapos, as tensions cool. Now royal biographer Andrew Morton told the Sun that Harry and Meghan wish toto the UK for three key family milestones. They include the Queen’s th birthday on April , the Duke of Edinburgh’s th in June and the unveiling of a statue of Princess Diana on July , which would have been her th birthday. He told the paper: “Although they will do some of it by Zoom, Harry wants to meet face to face to tie it all up. “Things seem to have calmed down. Harry has been in contact with the Queen more often than you would think. But certain things you need to be there in person to sort. They will need a few weeks. That could be done after April, depending on Covid.” When Harry and Meghan used social media site Instagram to announce their plans to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family in January, there was anger among royals and royal aides.As part of the deal which was hammered out at Sandringham, this -month review was set in stone. It is expected that any extension to the arrangement will be worked out by senior royals but one aide told the sun that the discussions could likely drag on past March .  In a relatively short space of time since stepping back, the Sussexes have made their positions very clear and any wriggle room could be hard to come by. However, a source revealed that Harryaposs regret at losing his military titles keeps an olive branch out between the Firm and the Prince - so long as those roles are unfilled. The Royal Family has faced called to replace Harry and Meghan as president and vice-president of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust, with a spokesperson for the charity forced to reassure people that the pair remain “as committed as ever.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harrys devastating conversation kate","story":"NewsPrince Harrys devastating conversation about Kate Middleton after her wedding to WilliamPrince Harry watched on with pride as his brother Prince William married Kate Middleton in , but shortly afterwards he had to sit down for a tough conversation with Chelsy DavymirrorShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video prince-william-kate-alter-royal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The couple looked completely in love as they said their vows and shared a sweet kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Kateaposs le changed forever as she officially became the Duchess of Cambridge and joined the royal family, but the day also had a huge impact on best man Prince Harryaposs future. At the time, he was in an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy - a Zimbabwean layer who Harry had known since school. They were extremely good friends, and Chelsy supported Harry through some of the hardest times of his royal le. However, she struggled to deal with the royal spotlight, and it was Kate and Williamaposs extravagant wedding that proved to her for the final time that it wasnapost the le she wanted. They werenapost actually together at the time of the royal wedding, but Chelsy was still invited as one of Harryaposs closest friends - and someone who knew the bride and groom well. Harry is also said to have read his best man speech over the phone to Chelsy, and she advised him to cut out some of the cheekier jokes.  In her royal biography Harry: Conversations with the Prince, journalist Angela Levin writes: “Harry had read it out at first over the phone to Chelsy in South Africa, who despite no longer being his steady girlfriend, has also been invited to the wedding. “She suggested he remove some of the racier anecdotes, including a reference to Kate’s ‘killer legs’, as she didn’t think the Queen would take kindly to laddish humour.” But watching the wedding from the inside gave Chelsy a real insight into what her future as a royal we would be like - and she didnapost like it.  In his book Battle of Brothers, royal expert Robert Lacey explains that she sat Harry down for a heart to heart shortly after the wedding, finally ending their long romance. He writes: In , after more comings and goings, she finally decided to go - and it was, ironically, Kate and Williamaposs grand and glorious wedding that spring that did it for her. According to a friend, she told Harry that she could never make the scaries she had witnessed Kate making, particularly when it came to moulding her le around the unremitting attention of the press.

One source said: “The last thing you want on operations is food poisoning and experience has shown that is less likely to happen with a plant-based diet. “Guys started coming back from a six-month tour of duty where they haven’t eaten meat and have decided to stick with a veggie diet.” "},{"url":null,"title":"storm bella uk battered 70mph","story":"NewsStorm Bella: UK battered with mph gales leaving s of homes without powerSandbags have been issued to at-risk houses and police have warned drivers to be aware of fallen trees and other hazards on the road as Storm Bella sweeps across the countrymirrorShareCommentsByTom DavidsonAssistant news editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video heavy-flooding-hits-bedfordshire-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Winds of up to mph are battering the UK with fears about fallen trees on roads and widespread flooding in areas of central England already sodden with rain. Sandbags have been issued to at risk householders. The West Country and South Wales was first in the firing line as the huge Atlantic storm barrelled in. Have you been affected  Let us know in the comments belowIn Cornwall, more than  homes were without electricity this evening in the Plymouth and Truro area, and  were blacked out in Bristol and Bath. In Wales,  were hit in Cardf and more than  in the Swansea area. But the storm was hitting further inland too - nearly  homes were blacked out near Telford and another  near Nottingham.  Power board engineers were working in aposrapidly deterioratingapos conditions to find and fix the faults in the teeth of the howling wind and driving rain. Homes were flooded as river levels rose at Cirencester, Glos, where one shivering, elderly woman had to try to buy a torch today because sheaposd had no electricity or heating for more than  hours. Another family had to be temporarily re-housed overnight, according to Cirencester Sales and Lettings. In a post on Facebook they said: Unfortunately we have had to re-house a family due to local flooding, the flooding started yesterday and it won the battle overnight. We are lucky we work with some amazing landlords who understand and care and we were all able to work together to find them temporary accommodation. Not what anyone wants at any time of the year! Thoughts are with anyone at this time still fighting the flood battle, it’s not over yet! The Environment Agency has now issued a flood warning along the River Churn, with the strongest alert in Cirencester.  Cotswold District Council said it is providing sandbags and is in contact with those families who have been affected and face suffering more upheaval. The council leader, Joe Harris, said We know that a number of our residents have had their Christmas ruined and we are doing all we can to support them. We are working with Cirencester Town Council which is providing local support and we are liaising with parish councils in Siddington and South Cerney which are also experiencing rising river levels and may have residents whose homes are under threat of flooding. We are replenishing sand bag supplies for communities at risk where the town and parish councils have already exhausted their supplies. He said the parish church in Cirencester is open todayfor people to warm up, charge mobile phones, use the toilets and get a hot drink. In a post on Facebook, people were reminded to wear face masks inside the church and only visit with members of their household or bubble. Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service has been working with Thames Water to pump water out of some buildings but there is widespread concern that the incoming bad weather will cause the water levels to rise even more. Bosses of Harry Hares, a restaurant in Cirencester town centre, have been appealing on social media for people to help pump water out of the building.There are reports of flooding in Siddington and South Cerney too. Parts of the country are already sodden after recent wet weather and flooding, with residents in more than , properties along the River Great Ouse in Bedfordshire advised to leave their homes as water levels rose on Christmas Day. The areaaposs fire chief said telling people they needed to leave their home at Christmas was a terrible message to deliver. Paul Fuller, chief fire officer at Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, told BBC News: It is of course a dreadful thing when weaposve faced all these months of dficulty and restriction. He added: The peak in Bedford has now passed it seems, but the towns and villages further down stream are still at risk."},{"url":null,"title":"supermarkets issue apology after christmas","story":"NewsTesco and Aldi supermarkets issue apologies after Christmas ruined by rotten turkeysYesterday some supermarket shoppers were left disappointed when they opened up their turkeys - only to discover they were rottenmirrorShareCommentsByRachel Pugh:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsFurious customers said their Christmas was wrecked \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dawn Marie Wilson was told she had terminal cancer six years ago, when she was just .The teacher, from Caerphilly, found a lump in her breast and was diagnosed with grade three breast cancer which eventually spread to her lymph nodes, reports Wales Online. She was was given the all clear in  after undergoing extensive breast cancer treatment, but in  was given the devastating news that the disease had ed aggressively.Has your le been touched by cancer  Share your experiences in the comments below... Dawn was told she had just  months to live - while her ex-husband Iain, the father of her children, was battling incurable neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease. To the amazement of her doctors, Dawn beat her prognosis and even went back to teaching in the classroom. In the first round of her cancer fight, she received treatment and had a double mastectomy. She also underwent a hysterectomy after being told she carried the BRCA  cancer gene. Dawn was eventually given the all-clear in August  and she married her partner, Stephen Wilson, in .  But by March  Dawn found a new lump and an oncologist confirmed the cancer had ed with a tumour below her collar bone – this time it was incurable. On October  Dawn died at the age of . It was the first day of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Talking about Dawn, her widower Stephen, , said: She was a very likeable person. She was magnetic – people seemed to gravitate towards her. She absolutely loved teaching and she absolutely lived for teaching. In the period between leaving her teaching post and going back she missed it terribly. Her kids were her le. I have had so many pupils who she taught who would come up to us and say hello when we were shopping in town. They all loved her and wanted to say hello and that was something to be proud of. When Dawn was told her diagnosis was terminal her role as an educator proved even more vital and erse as she went on to campaign to help more women in Wales learn about how to spot signs of breast cancer.  Dawn became known for the work she did with the Know Your Lemons Foundation that was founded by Corrine Beaumont. The campaign centres around a visual aid that shows  lemons in an egg box – each egg shows what the visual indicators of breast cancer can look like. Dawn didnapost come across the campaign until after she was diagnosed. This led to her to debateher le could have turned out dferentlyshe had seen it sooner and was more aware of what the symptoms looked like. She wanted to further the campaign and after a lot of hard work eventually managed to get the Know Your Lemons campaign officially endorsed by NHS Wales. The lemon posters were distributed to more than  GP practices across the country and schools also began to educate students about how vital it is to self-check for symptoms.  Stephen explained that a fund has now been set up by the charity to help train people in Wales to go out and support women and teach them more about how they can spot the signs of breast cancer. Even on her lowest days when she would be straight out of chemotherapy she would still be on the phone or on the laptop and getting things sorted, Stephen added. She was determined that other people wouldnapost suffer the same fate as her. She was unbelievable like that. She would want people to have the confidence to check themselves, diagnose themselves, and go to the GP and say: aposSomething is not right with my body – I want you to have a lookapos. Any delay can do so much damage. Teenagers like Dawnaposs daughters shouldnapost have to lose a mother at any age. Dawnaposs daughters Imogen, , and Madeleine, , are now in the care of Stephen at their home in Wenvoe. Stephen also has a daughter called Yvie who is nine. Even though  has been a tough year for so many dferent reasons the family were able to spend some time together before Dawn passed away. During August they managed to escape to enjoy the holiday Dawn had always dreamed of them sharing in Italy. Stephen said: We travelled through France and Italy. Sulmona was one of Dawnaposs favourite places in the world and she had always wanted me to go there. In January I decided we would go out there. I didnapost realise it would be the last thing we did together. It was one of the best things we did. When they ed from their holiday they came back to an unpleasant shock. Dawn had been expecting some results but nothing prepared the family for what they were about to be told. They were informed the cancer had spread to Dawnaposs brain and her lungs. Stephen said: They didnapost say it but it was apparent her time was limited.In late September Dawn had to be taken into hospital. The tumours on the brain had become worse and she was moved to a hospice shortly afterwards. She basically had a stroke, added Stephen. Covid made it a lot worse because, initially, they were strict about visitors. They were trying to restrict visitors being there. Eventually they saw sense and they were really accommodating in the end. Dawnaposs worst nightmare was dying in a hospital on her own so the staff allowed us to come in and do shts. Stephen, Dawnaposs brother, and Dawnaposs mother would take it in turns to sit with Dawn during her final moments. The children were also able to visit whenever they wanted to. Stephen said: When she passed away her brother was next to her. I had literally just left. I was just getting ready to go to bed when I had the phone call. It was tough but it was reassuring to know that her brother was there for her. Her worst-case scenario was being alone. It was a massive comfort to know that someone was there when she passed. As Stephen talked about Dawn he lit up when asked to describe what some his favourite things about her were. He explained that he is quite quiet and introverted whereas Dawn was a big personality whose energy would fill a room. This is one of the many things he loved about her. Stephen said: Dawn was very loud and very brash. I am very quiet, but we had the same sense of humour. She said what she thought. My favourite thing about her was we never left anything unsaid – no matter what it was. If there was a problem we would say it and work it out. Thataposs rare these days. She had a remarkable amount of energy and would make me go out to places I didnapost want to go and we would have a lovely time. When asked how the girls have been coping Stephen added: They are up and down but they are nowhere near as bad as we expected them to be. They are really leaning a lot on family, which is lovely.

The UKaposs elderly and most clinically vulnerable people, and front line health and care workers are first in the queue. Oxford and AstraZeneca have said each dose of their vaccine candidate costs about as much as a cup of coffee, as scientists work to ready the jab for the masses. Several million doses of the jab have been manufactured and are ready to be deployed from January , reports The Sunday Telegaph. The government has ordered  million doses, with most expected to be rolled out by March .  It has reportedly set a target of million of both vaccinations to be administered within a fortnight. A source close to the Government told the Mail on Sunday officials have been given estimates that once the  to million most vulnerable people have received a Covid- vaccine, the NHS could no longer be at risk of being overwhelmed by hospital admissions. Despite the rollout being yet to crack the one-million milestone, some officials hope this point could be achieved by the end of February, the source told the newspaper. The virus would continue to spread throughout the wider population who are less at risk from severe illness - but easing of pressure on the NHS would remove the argument for further shutdowns, the source claimed.  It is hoped Oxford University and AstraZenecaaposs jab could soon be ready, in another boost to the UKaposs vaccine effort. But even as the mass vaccination programme begins in earnest, new mutant strains of coronavirus were discovered circulating in the UK a short time later. A new iant originating in the South East has been blamed for rapid spreading in the region and London. The discovery of the mutant strain ripping through Kent and the capital prompted the UK Government to axe its Christmas mixing plans. Households in Tier  areas were banned from spending Christmas together, and for everyone  the plans to allow five days of festivities were drastically reduced. The four nations walked back on earlier encouragement for people to travel to join together in festive season aposbubbles.apos Shortly before Christmas, mutant strains originating in South Africa were discovered spreading in the UK. Pfizeraposs chief and UK officials have assured at this stage they believe the vaccine should work against the new mutations. However Government scientists have warned the strain spreading from the South East appears to be particularly virulent, and driving fresh infection spikes.

Warnings are in place across almost all of the UK, including two threat to le flood notices, and families have labelled their Christmas a write-off after they were forced to evacuate due to rising water levels. An amber warning for wind is in place across the south coast and South Wales, with communities from Cornwall to Kent told to expect building damage and the possibility of flying debris while Storm Bella hits the country.On Saturday evening a gust of mph was recorded at Aberdaron in north Wales, with further yellow weather warnings for wind and rain in place across England, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern Scotland into Sunday indicating mph winds are likely across the country, according to the Met Office.There are also snow and ice warnings in place for much of Scotland for Sunday, set to continue into Monday. Two severe flood warnings indicating a potential threat to le are in place at Cogenhoe Mill caravan site near Northampton and on the River Nene near Billing Aquadrome. Flood defences had been put up in St Neots, Cambridgeshire ahead of the overnight storm.The conditions follow several days of wet weather in parts of southern and eastern England which meant that more than , homes near Bedford have been evacuated over Christmas. One family described eating turkey sandwiches in a hotel on December  after police knocked on their door telling them to leave home late on Christmas Eve. Clare Devany, , husband James Hodgson, , and their daughters, aged four and five, spent Christmas Day moving furniture to the top floor of their house in Bedford, before leaving to spend the night in a hotel in nearby Peterborough.Ms Devany told the PA news agency: You walk around and you just have to work out what to sacrice. For us, that was things like the TV, because it was mounted and we didnapost have time to take it down, the living room cabinets. Itaposs furniture, itaposs not the end of the world. We moved paperwork, photos, all of the kidaposs memorabilia, their toys - everything came upstairs. The only thing we didnapost touch because we didnapost have time was the kitchen. She said the day was a festive write off after the family were visited by police at .pm on Christmas Eve and advised to leave. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick urged people to check Government advice, such as from the Environment Agency, who have asked people to keep away from swollen rivers and flooded land. A statement on their website said: It is often deeper than it looks and just cm of flowing water is enough to float your car.As well as the stormy conditions, temperatures will stay frosty in some parts into next week, leading health professionals to offer advice on how to keep safe in colder weather. Dr Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, consultant in public health at Public Health England said: Heat your home to at least Cyou can, particularlyyou have reduced mobility, are  and over, or have a health condition such as heart or lung disease. If you canapost heat all the rooms you use, heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to bed. Wearing a few layers of thin clothing is better at trapping heat than one thick layer and will help to keep you warm.

The gangway to this next chapter in our island’s history is the trade deal negotiated by Boris Johnson. It is a bridge that is narrow, uncertain and built on potentially unstable foundations. The Prime Minister has agreed a limited deal that covers trade in goods, but not in services, which make up  per cent of our economy. Even with this agreement, businesses will now face additional red tape in the form of checks at borders and time-consuming form-filling. Our fishing industry has been sold short, with the EU still able to plunder much of our stock.Despite claims to the contrary, this is not a deal that offers certainty.  Read the small print and you’ll find that the EU retains the right to impose punishing tarfs on UK firmsit believes we have broken our promise to abide by shared standards. To add to the instability, large chunks of the agreement are up for review in four years’ time. What happens to Northern Ireland, which remains within the single market for the time being, has yet to be resolved. Holidaymakers and travellers to Europe face being hit by higher insurance fees, mobile phone charges and driving costs. Our security is also undermined by the loss of access to the European Arrest Warrant and limited rights to other police databases. The Prime Minister’s triumphalism cannot mask the fact that this is a hard Brexit that will leave Britain less prosperous and more isolated. The benefits of regaining our sovereignty and ending free movement of people have to be offset against the economic and security consequences. The best that can be said of the agreement is that it is better than a damaging and costly no-deal Brexit. To coin a phrase, even a bad deal is better than no deal. What happens next will rest with the Prime Minister and him alone. He was the main cheerleader for Brexit. He was responsible for negotiating this deal and it is his name on the finished document. Few have faith that Johnson is the right person to take the nation through these next few years.

The -year-old woman has bravely spoken about the cruel ordeal as he was finally sent behind bars. She said she lived in fear of him and was scared to leave him, worrying he would kill her and dump her body in a lake. Seren was beaten, strangled, spat on and threated with a machete kne by her now ex-boyfriend Paul Robert Morgan Richards-Keegan, . Their relationship began in July  and was amazing in the first five or six months, she said.But from that point onwards, she fell victim to Richards-Keeganaposs serious pattern of violence on her - which escalated through the lockdown period of the pandemic when people in the UK were ordered to stay home, reports Wales Online. Seren, originally from Cardf, said she felt under Richards-Keeganaposs control and was unable to leave the relationship. Every time she tried, he threatened her until she agreed to stay, she said. On one occasion, neighbours described Richards-Keeganaposs actions towards Seren as looking like something out of a horror movie as they saw her in ripped clothes with blood dripping from her mouth. She has bravely decided to tell the full story of her horric treatment to make sure no other woman suffers at the hands of her ex-partner - and that it will also help others going through the same situation to seek help. In January, Seren started taking pictures of the injuries Richards-Keegan inflicted on her, to build evidence against him. She said: I was living in fear day and night and every time I tried to leave he would threaten me. I took photos and videos as he used to tell me all the time that he would kill me and put my body up the lakes. I will never ever trust a man again. Richards-Keegan was sentenced at Swansea Crown Court on December .  Hanna George, prosecuting, read out details of Richards-Keeganaposs actions towards Seren. She said: The offences arose out of the relationship he had with his ex-partner. They were in a relationship for approximately two years. It initially started well but after five months, the relationship deteriorated into a violent one. The defendant was controlling throughout the relationship and he isolated her from her family and friends. She felt trapped.  A pattern of serious violence against her which escalated through the lockdown period of the pandemic. On March , Richards-Keegan pulled clumps out of Serenaposs hair, hit her over her head and spat in her face. Seren tried to contact the police, but her partner warned her not to say anything.  When Seren asked why he had done that to her, Ms George said Richards-Keegan replied saying itaposs what he did, that he did not love her and did not care. On May , after a disagreement about the selling of the defendantaposs motorbike, Richards-Keegan grabbed [Serenaposs] face and pushed her against a wall. He beat her to the point that her mouth was full of blood. Then on June , he again assaulted Seren in bed. He hit her so hard a left hand print could be found on her lower back, prosecuting counsel Ms George said. A month later, Richards-Keegan then strangled Seren as she tried to run out of the house to get help - suffering visible marks on her neck. Worse was to come. In August, Seren was then threatened with a machete at am when she told Richards-Keegan the relationship was over. As he brandished the deadly blade, she was told to shut up and sit in the dark in case the police turned up. Ms George said Richards-Keegan told Seren thatshe screamed, the machete would go through her. He then lashed out, beating Seren so savagely her lungs began to hurt. When she begged for mercy, she was told who gives a f***  You are lucky to still be alive.  On August  Seren again mustered the courage to try and leave Richards-Keegan. She said she packed her bags and did not pick him up from work as she usually would. Ms George told the court: [Seren] did not pick him up from work and she locked the front door. He turned up at the address and he demanded she let him in. He told hershe let him enter he would not become violent. With that reassurance, she let him enter her house. When he entered, he lost his temper and she ran upstairs to the bathroom to lock herself in. He got in, grabbed her by the throat and said he would kill her. After a period of time he let go and told her to catch her breath, then he did it again. She thought the defendant was going to kill her. He let go and she ran to the bedroom. The defendant strangled her and hit her over the face, she ran out of the house he chased her and he pushed her against the fence outside and repeatedly punched her and her top became torn. Ms George said neighbours became aware of the noise and looked outside to see what was going on. She said they described it as looking like a scene from a horror movie, adding: She was covered in blood, her clothes were ripped and she was bleeding from her mouth. Neighbours called the police. When police attended, she was so fearful that she did not fully disclose what had happened, Ms George added. After being taken to Bronglais Hospital, Seren - whose weight plummeted to just six stone because of the stress - broke down to doctors as she detailed the horric physical and mental abuse she had suffered before building up the courage to go to the police. Richards-Keegan was arrested and questioned by police. However after being taken to Aberystwyth Police Station, and despite the seriousness of the situation, he began calling members of Serenaposs family to try put pressure on her to drop the case against him. But by the time the case got to court, the game was up for Richards-Keegan. His barrister David Singh said his client admitted subjecting his ex-partner to a series of appalling acts. He said that for the counts he pleaded guilty for he did so at an early stage and that Richards-Keegan had not been charged for violence against a romantic partner previously. His Honour Judge Huw Rees said Richards-Keegan poses a high risk of harm to women he is in an intimate relationship with. He said: [These are] serious offences against a young and vulnerable woman who has been left scared. You demeaned her as a woman and you, unbeknown to you at the time, demeaned yourself. Richards-Keegan had previously pleaded guilty to four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault, criminal damage, attempting to pervert the course of justice - the phone call he made from the police station urging family members to contact the victim - and making threats to kill.  He was sentenced to a total of four years in prison. He will serve up to half that period in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community.

Only mid-way through a flight travelling more than , miles away from their home do the pair realise that theyaposve left their eight-year-old son at home for the holidays, giving him the responsibility of buying his own toothbrush and fighting off home intruders armed with a blowtorch and a gun. But accidents happen. And itaposs an easy one to make - Kevin is told to sleep in the attic after causing a family riot over a cheese pizza, a neighbouring kid who has a similar taste in hats is mistakenly included in the head count the following morning, and itaposs all an innocent mistake. Right  But some eagle-eyed fans think itaposs not as simple as it seems, and have accused one family member of deliberately ensuring Kevin is put in harmaposs way, with a very sinister motive.Fans on Reddit have shared a theory that Kevinaposs dad Peter planned the whole thing after spotting that he binned Kevinaposs plane ticket that would have otherwise flagged his absence at the airport. During the clean-up operation following cheese pizza-gate, thereaposs a blink-and-youaposll-miss-it moment where Peter throws a pile soggy napkins into the bottom of the bin, and peering out from behind them is an American Airlines ticket with the name aposKevinapos handwritten on the front. And itaposs one to many unlucky coincidences for some, as one said: Letaposs dispel with this fiction that Mr. McCallister doesnapost know what heaposs doing. He knows exactly what heaposs doing. A second said: He hired those two robbers to rob his house without telling them Kevin would be there, with the plan being that they would panic and kill Kevin .

We know that the top goalscorer is on the bench.“If you’re not pulling your weight or not playing well, you’re going to get hooked. It’s only good for the club and healthy for ourselves that there’s competition.”To have two Scotland internationals combining to win the Killie game will be a huge boost to United going into today’s clash against the Steelmen.McNulty admitted that he has still not given up on being part of national coach Steve Clarke’s squad, albeit his last appearance for his country was against San Marino back in March .“Obviously, I would love to get back in the Scotland set-up but I just need to concentrate on playing well every week for the club,” said McNulty.“Shanks will want to stay in the set-up as well.“Again, that means healthy competition because you have both of us wanting to score goals and both of us wanting to do well and get in that set-up.“Who is to say both of us can’t “But it’s all about concentrating on United, doing a sht here and winning games and taking the club further up the table.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I said I was interested but sales wasn#t really for me, I wanted to be behind the mic.#They got me on board though and my late we said to me #are you off your head# and I maybe was as I took a massive pay cut and moved up to Forfar from Fe however it definitely seems to have paid off.#The change in radio presenting from then to now is phenomenal. The technology is so dferent.#I remember I used to go in for my shts and there would be two turntables and a cassette player, now we have at least seven computers in front of us but that allows us the ability to not only broadcast to Tayside but I am also on air in six other regions at the same time too.#When I did my breakfast show for  years back in the early s, I used to get up every morning at am and go into my office which had all my records.#There were shelves and shelves of them but they weren#t in alphabetical order, they were in order based on what the weather was outside.#So I had a rainy day section, a sunny day section and I would pick what I was going to play from them.#It was when he was starting his breakfast shows that suddenly he was no longer known as Arthur Ballingall # but instead Ally Bally.He explained: #The name wasn#t a childhood nickname or anything like that it was actually when I was about to start my breakfast show and they had to create a jingle for me.#Kenny Page was the man in charge of making all the jingles up and he came to me one day and said he just could not get the surname Ballingall to work so he told me he had changed my name a bit and I was just to listen.#It kept going on about this Ally Bally and I asked him who that was and he replied #you!#.#He was right to change it though and now it has stuck. I have a lot to thank him for actually.#Over the years Ally has covered a number of events but one of his most notable is the day the RRS Discovery came back to Dundee.#There was a wee boat that was going out to the mouth of the Tay to collect the boat and lead it back to Dundee,# he said.#I was given the chance to go on the boat and since we thought it would only be about an hour out we decided I would present live from the boat # it ended up being much further than we thought and I was live from the boat from midday to seven at night.#It was an amazing thing to experience though.#In more recent times Ally has also held the positions of Programme Director and managing director as well as Regional Managing Director-Scotland North .Now he will go on to face new challenges although he#s not quite sure what they are yet.He said: #Although this year has been challenging for everyone, it has allowed me some time for reflection on what an amazing career I’ve had with Tay for the past  years.#With this in mind, and with so many great memories under my belt, I feel it’s the right time for me to take on something new.#I am definitely not retiring though I just want to do something new and let the young ones come in to radio.#So I would like to thank every single one of my listeners from the past  years and also # give me a jobyou have one.#Ally’s final show will be on Sunday December  at am-pm and his replacement will be announced in due course.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Danny Mullen peeled off and cut the ball back from the byline, finding Sow but his effort found the foot of the goalie.The big Swede did get his second after  minutes after Mullen took advantage of a missed clearance at the back for the Doonhamers.The former St Mirren man was stopped by Ferguson but the ball fell to Sow on the edge of the area and he rolled into the empty net at the second attempt after his first was blocked by Ayo Obileye.The wind was starting to swirl and almost worked in the favour of the Dark Blues four minutes before the break as another Adam corner headed goalwards. This time it cracked off the crossbar.Conditions continued to deteriorate after the break but that didn#t stop Dundee looking for a third.On  minutes, Sow found Mullen with a cross to the far post but the forward didn#t catch his shot, allowing Ferguson to push behind.And it was - two minutes later, once more Sow the right man in the right place.This time Queens failed to deal with a Liam Fontaine throw giving Mullen a look at goal. He, though, lost his footing and his effort fell to Sow for a tap-in at the far post.With  minutes remaining Paul McGowan sent in a cross from the right for the head of Lee Ashcroft but the centre-half sent his effort over the bar from six yards.The Doonhamers had the chance to cut the deficit on  minutes as Dan Pybus got free in the area but saw his low effort expertly pushed wide by Jack Hamilton.They did get on the scoresheet with eight minutes to go as an inswinging Shields cross curled into the far corner with the help of the wind.However, there was no repeat of Dunfermline#s comeback this week as Dundee held on to move up to fourth in the Championship table.Queens XI: Ferguson, Maxwell, Buchanan, Obileye, McKee , Fitzpatrick , Pybus, Shields, McCabe, East, Gibson.Subs not used: Leighfield, McGrory, McMahon, Sylla.Dundee XI: Hamilton, Elliott, Fontaine, Ashcroft, Marshall, Byrne, McGhee, Adam , McGowan, Mullen , Sow .Subs not used: Ferrie, Kerr, Forster, Anderson.Referee: Alan Newlands.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"friends reunited as red star and saints meet again","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We want to remind people that our pet bereavement support service is here to help those who are grieving the loss of a pet.People can contact our free and confidential support line on    or email pbssmail@bluecross.org.uk for advice and support.Diane James, Pet Bereavement Support Service manager, Blue Cross.We know there are many people having a really dficult time during this pandemic who are suffering from anxiety, fear, despair, depression, etc. Might I suggest that there is only one sure antidote to this situation and that is PRAYER # it can do wonders!The person who prays sincerely from the heart will encounter an inner peace, even joy.  That person does not have to be ‘religious’ or of a certain religion, it can be anyone.  We are all God’s children because he created each one of us inidually andanyone who seeks him sincerely and humbly in prayer, God will answer that person who will experience ‘the peace that is beyond all human understanding’ which, of course, is God coming to live in their heart.You may not believe me but I can assure you prayer works. Evenyou are a non-believer or one who doubts in the existence of God, you can always say #Godyou are there please, please come and help me#.Give it a go and not only will it give you relief from boredom and loneliness when you pray but numerous other benefits will accrue – and, of course, dipping into a Bible will enrich your prayer enormously.Calum MacFarlane-Barrow, Dalmally."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas.

Hugh Fe with his accordion and Kevin Williams on guitar and vocals sheltered in a gazebo outside the building with their music carried to loudspeakers in the lounge where the residents had gathered.

Give until January  and public donations will be doubled by the UK Government, up to £ million – meaning we can reach even more hungry children in Liberia with le-changing school meals.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk Christmas to set your place.Wishing you a peaceful and happy Christmas.Daniel Adams , executive director, Mary’s Meals UKSir,What happened to Lochgilphead postmaster Findlay Campbell was tragic.But we need to get the post office service back.I realise that a Post Office van comes up from Tarbert three days a week at the moment, but with a queue of  people having to stand in the cold and damp # as there was on a Wednesday recently # this is hardly conducive to the customers# health, let alone convenience.I trust something is being done tothis much-needed service to the town of Lochgilphead.Celia MacFarlane, LochgilpheadSir,During questions to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson on Thursday December , I told the minister that people were exasperated with the condition of both the A and A after years of promises of investment in them.Mr Matheson’s response, which mainly referenced plans to upgrade the A and the A, will be of little comfort to residents and businesses in the West Highlands who are utterly dependent on the A and A.We have had more than enough woolly pledges over the years, usually made in the run-up to an election, which are then quietly forgotten afterwards, and I’m afraid that Michael Matheson’s response indicates that it will be business as usual as far as his government is concerned.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,I found your article on #Tougher health cuts worry# in the December  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser very dficult to read.I was concerned about the statement attributed to Councillor Mulvaney saying: #It is the same things that are there # learning disability, older people and physical disability # all chunky sums of money at circa £k to ££k#.Yes, they are chunky sums of money and have been on the agenda for some time.  However, we are talking about people human beings who have ious disabilities, learning, physical, and people who are older, something that will eventually happen to us all. People are not just a category for cost cutting, particularly those most vulnerable.This statement could be interpreted in many ways. For me it reads that people with such disabilities and getting older are a drain on our resources, and we need to cut out the services we provide for them. It all sounds like they are a burden on the finances, and that has got to stop. All because the budget must be balanced#at any cost it seems.My question to Councillor Mulvaney is quite simple # What you would do to address these particular costs  Decant everyone into another council area, or simply just hope thatservices are cut so they cannot live in their own homes, or indeed anywhere within Argyll and Bute, they leave Perhaps CouncillorMulvaney has never experienced anyone with disabilities. I have, and unless one has that experience then putting a price on providing a quality service is impossible. Vulnerable people need support which gives them, as much as possible, some sort of a meaningful le. Maybe that is why costs cannot actually be cut, and there needs to be a complete re-think. People are not just a statistic, nor should they be apparently dismissed as a commodity that is costing too much.If the HSCP does not have enough funding to deliver the services stated in the strategic plan, and to the standards it states, it needs to fight to get the correct level of funding from the Scottish Government, or perhaps look at itself and cut down on what I see are excessive layers of management, to make savings in order to deliver to the right level of all services within Argyll and Bute.Heather A Grier, CowalSir,A tunnel in the Faroe Islands is almost complete. It is km long under the ocean floor, connecting two of the islands and slashing the travelling time from over an hour to  minutes.They have started work on a second tunnel, now  per cent complete.

These species grow in the arid conditions of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, where they have been tapped for their precious sap for millennia.Mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts, frankincense and myrrh were prized for the sweet aromatic fumes they produce when burned, and were used to freshen the airduring embalming of the dead and offering sacrices to the gods. Frankincense and myrrh are components of incense, and as such were carried along ancient trade routes.Incense reached Western Europe with crusaders ing from the Eastern Roman Empire where it was wafted in churches, a use that continues today.Also, frankincense and myrrh are used in traditional Chinese medicines # recommended for conditions as erse as inflammation, pain, fever, indigestion and ulcers. They are also components of mosquito deterrents, deodorants and toothpaste. All fairly obscure you may think, but sales of frankincense have recently rocketed it is now an important part of the international, multi-million pound essential oil industry. Great for the trade, but the booming market is putting severe strain on the supply chain*.Back in the Horn of Africa the trees are suffering. Powerful middle men are encouraging local owners to over-tap their trees for this desirable commodity, resulting in stressed trees, less seed production and virtually no young trees growing up to maintain the plantations.Yet, there is hope, but speed is of the essence. Tappers are being encouraged to form co-operatives, and are getting expert help with tree management.

The HSCP has also provided a webcam, headset and hands-free audio unit for remote consultations.Among a number of private donations was money to provide frames for WWII remembrance boards researched by the late Bob Adams.

energy, connectivity and the islands], I am bound to adhere to the Ministerial Code, which includes strict limits on publication of legal advice to ministers.ldquoThis is a similar position that Tory UK ministers would have to take in a similar scenario, and Ms Hamilton knows this.:Coronavirus vaccinations begin in Borders care homesIn the votes on November  and , the SNP was the only party which did not support the release of legal advice.Mrs Hamilton said: ldquoPeople of the Borders have a right to see these key legal documents which will shed a light on how complainers were failed and why

ldquoPhase  of the Learning Estate Investment Programme, which councils will also contribute towards.SNP councillor Heather Anderson, a Tweeddale West member, said: ldquoThe government are to be congratulated for paying close attention to the education needs of our young people in the Borders and for recognising that the fire at Peebles High School required the exceptional response of funding two new schools in the Borders.Yesterday , councillors agreed to launch public consultations on the details of the Borders schools being built.A campus to be proud ofMr Bell said: ldquoNew high schools are expensive because they include so many facilities in a push to make them into Community Campuses, so the total funding for Galashiels and Peebles could amount to a whopping poundm.ldquoBut it is because of the diligent work of council officers through the Covid-pandemic that the plans for Galashiels are so far advanced that we can now get a funding announcement.ldquoThe detailed location on the large current site in that town is yet to be finalised, but including new sports facilities and potentially a replacement swimming pool, this will be a campus to be proud of.I hope Peebles will be excitedMs Anderson added: ldquoThe devastating fire last year at Peebles put enormous pressure on students and staff.ldquoAided by council officers and council partners they have been able to get back to teaching on one site at Springfield Road for nearly a year.ldquoBecause the site is large enough it is possible to build a completely new school, which is what we called for last year but because current proposals are to build a brand new school there can be minimum disruption to teaching in the old or temporary buildings.ldquoWe have had a sneak preview of the proposal and I think it is just great!ldquoI hope the Peebles public will be as excited as we are when the plans are finalised, drawn up, and put out to consultation.Statement from John SwinneyMr Swinney said: ldquoI am determined that our pupils have access to high-quality, up-to-date facilities that parents, staff and children can be proud of.ldquoThis next phase builds on our commitment and proven track record in replacing schools in the poorest condition so that more children or young people can be educated in high quality buildings and ensure equity of provision.ldquoScotlandrsquos construction industry has worked incredibly hard to deal with the many challenges presented by the COVID pandemic.\"This funding will help the sector, sustaining many jobs and providing a welcome boost to communities across the country.ldquoMany of the projects will include wider community facilities and integration as part of the new school build or refurbishment.\"These facilities are so much more than just a school where children are educated, they are the centre piece of communities with links to the wider learning estate such as further education facilities and community libraries.Statement

Breathe new le into old wine bottlesLetrsquos face it, we all have a lot of wine bottles lying around over Christmas. But with some councils requiring you to venture to a bottle bank to recycle them, it can be a bit of an inconvenience to have them lying around the house and taking up space.The good news is that therersquos lots of craft that you can employ to make these old bottles into a kitschy decoration. One of the most popular is to buy some tall candles, shave them around the base so they are thin enough to fit into the opening of the bottle, then simply let the candle burn down so that the wax drips down in a rustic fashion.Alternatively, you can use old fabric to stitch together a Santa hatto sit over the bottle as a festive centrepiece. And, of course, you donrsquot have to use wine bottles ndash any bottle will do.. Make decoupage Christmas cardsRequiring much more effort than just picking up a multipack of Christmas cards, decoupage is a great way to show that you care.There are plenty of designs that you can get online , but you will need a steady hand and lots of patience to cut out and stack each inidual layer.Itrsquos a great task to do with older kids, getting them to use their hand-eye coordination on something other than a games console, with a real sense of accomplishment when you see the finished version.Just make sure to leave enough time to send them out before the final Christmas posting dates .Christmas is just around the corner. Go foraging for rustic decorationsOne of the best things to come out of lockdown is that most of us have gained a renewed sense of appreciation for the outdoors.With rustic decorations firmly back in fashion, why not use your next woodland walk as an opportunity to pick up some greenery to add to your home  Holly and ivy can be found across the country, particularly in oak and beech woodland, with holly branches traditionally used to decorate homes while serving as a charm against witches.You can also thread greenery through bannisters, or to dress your table for Christmas day, with eucalyptus and mistletoeadding a delicate touch. Herbs like rosemary look great on top of Christmas cakes, while pinecones can be fun for kids to find and then paint before displaying in a jar or a basket.. Create a mini Christmas tree from plastic spoonsIt might sound tacky, but a mini tree made from plastic spoons can look surprisingly classyyou do it right.Simply pick up a multipack of disposable plastic spoonsand then cut off the circular spoon heads and discard the handles.From there, paint or decorate the spoon circles before gluing them in layers to a kitchen roll or similar base to create a fanned Christmas tree shape. You can even make a spoon trees of dferent sizes and display them together for a charming decoration.Find out more here..

And as demand rises so dothe prices, with some branded scented candles costing hundreds of pounds.But therersquos no need to spend a fortune. Instead, you can pick up some plain inexpensive candles and then decorate them yourself - getting all of the visual impact for a fraction of the price.The options are pretty much endless when it comes to decoration: you can paint the candle, add glue then sprinkle it with glitter, tie ribbons or seasonal herbs around the outside, stick on jewels or embellishments, use a template to trace on a designhellip we could go on.You can also make the candle itself from scratch and add your own scents, but you will need to buy wax, wicks and fragrance oils to do so.. Distil your own Christmas ginThe craft gin boom of recent years has seen no shortage of gins vying for your attention in the alcohol aisle. Butyou want to really impress this Christmas, why not distil your own Therersquos plenty of sets containing dried botanicals that you can buy online, or acquire independently, with some of the most popular being orange peel, peppercorn, cardamom, cinnamon, liquorice or rose petals.You can add whatever combinations of botanicals you like but, to qualy as a gin, juniper must be the most dominant botanical and the spirit must be at least .% ABV.All you really need to do is get a glass bottle or jar, add your chosen combination of botanicals and then top with quality vodka. Leave your infusion in a dark cupboard for around a week, shaking it once a day, then sieve out the botanicals to leave you with your gin.Experiment with some festive flavours for an extra bit of pizzazz.. Create some frosty branchesThese are incredibly easy and cheap to make despite being sold for signicantly more in most garden centres. Gather some branches or twigs from outside, prune them into the shape that you want and then spray paint them gold or silver. Then fill a plastic tub with glitter, add glue to your branches and dip them in the glitter before leaving to dry. Itrsquos best to do this all outside to minimise mess- so make sure the weather is dry while you do so. Once your frosty branches are complete you can either display them outside or in a vase indoors- they look particularly good when illuminated by a candle or the twinkle of Christmas lights.Get the tutorial here.. Make peppermint candy canesLegend has it that candy canes were invented by a Cologne choirmaster in the th century who wanted to remind children of the role of shepherds in the story of the nativity.From there they spread throughout Europe, now becoming one of the most popular decorations for our homes at Christmas. The good news is that they are reasonably easy to bake, meaning the whole family can get involved, while also requiring very few ingredients.Simply mix peppermint extract with dferent colours of pre-bought icingand then make two long sausages containing each colour.Twist the sausages together, slice into smaller pieces, mould into the desired hook shape and then leave them to set on a baking tray for  hours.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib. We’re busy – it is Christmas after all.We just don’t have time right now. We will make time for God when we’re less busy. And God crept in beside us when we were busy."},{"url":null,"title":"rosie reflects on the wonders of nature","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then, over the next couple of years, we slowly got them recorded.#Since forming The Strunts, the duo have performed live for a handful of gigs including the Kintyre Songwriters Festival and a couple of Homesong sets.David added: #Obviously it’s been impossible to perform recently and, as a result, we focussed on getting the album out. We#re delighted to say it is now for sale at The Kintyre Larder and The Fish Shop with donations from it going to Kintyre Food Bank and Children First.#Since the album#s release, the pair have had some great reviews in the music press, including this one from Ian D Hall in the Liverpool Sound And Vision: #Together as The Strunts, Les and David have found a common cause, one that sees the release of the album Too Much Of Everything, consistently catching the ear throughout.#The listener starts to understand that the only things you can have too much of are hate, apathy, ignorance and grief, that even in anger there must be subtle humour paving the way to the hope of healing.#A tremendous introduction to a new partnership.#Too Much of Everything is available for £ at The Kintyre Larder and at The Fish Shop, with  per cent of those sales being donated to the food bank and Children First until the end of January."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The landlord claimed that through inadvertent evidence upon which he proposed to rely had not been led before the court below and the appeal was allowed. Having heard the additional evidence, the higher court have now refused the appeal, and find the landlord appellant liable in expenses.In the course of a note, the court state that it was not disputed that the applicant was a yearly tenant of his house and land, and that his tenancy did not cease on his employment being brought to an end.Section  of the Crofters Act, , does not therefore apply, as these subjects were not let during the continuance of the employment, and he was not a tradesman placed in the district by the landlord for the benefit of the neighbourhood.Indeed, the respondent#s agent refused to found upon that section, and he placed his case upon the general argument that as this house was required for an estate servant, it would be a great hardship for the proprietor to be deprived of its use for that purpose, after the applicant#s intimation that he did not propose any longer to accept employment from the estate.The tenant has fulfilled all the statutory conditions and titling him to be declared a statutory small tenant, and we have no option but to grant an order to that effect. We therefore agree with the court below that this play falls to be repelled.The only other points raised by the respondent was that these subjects did not constitute a holding in respect that the ground attached to the house was of comparatively small extent. For the reasons stated by Mr Barber, we do not see that we can give effect to this plea, and as the appellants agent stated that he did not raise any question on the amount of rent fixed, we have refused the appeal.Agent for the landlord # Mr Archd.

All important, yes, but why did he fail to mention the two sectors that face the challenge to their survival caused by Brexit: farming and fishing  Both sectors face severe financial ruin.On fishing, west coast fishermen rely on rapid transit to get their catches of prawns, langoustines, crabs and lobsters to Europe within  hours of landing.These vital exports will, due to Brexit, be subject to senseless bureaucracy of red tape before they reach their destination.Warnings from the fishing businesses all along the west coast of Scotland have been ignored by the UK Government. Coupled with this delay are tarfs set as Britain will no longer be an EU member.Next, to farming. Everything points to constant financial hardship. Lamb exports, vital for every sheep farmer in Scotland, face EU levies of  per cent of the value of these animals.For example, prime lambs currently worth £ to export will near be worth £. These levels ofwill make sheep production unviable. All exports of world famous Scotch beef will be levied, as well as Scotch food and drink exports currently worth many millions to the Scottish economy.In the  EU referendum, Scotland voted  per cent to  per cent to remain in the EU. As everyone in the UK surveys the last minute shambles of #No deal or bad deal#, they must be amazed at the absolute mess we are in.Our chance of salvation or rescue comes next May when Scotland has a chance to let Mr Cameron realise the folly of his party#s ways.Robert MacIntyre, Rothesay.First our children painted rainbows, then we stood on our doorsteps applauding the NHS.Now Scotland#s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and devolved administration will grant a one-off #thank you# payment to all NHS Scotland staff. The gross sum of £ will be paid to all full-time staff, including primary care and home care staff and care home and hospice workers.This bonus sum, costing upwards of £ million, will be taxable, resulting in those NHS staff members on the lowest income likely to be hit the hardest.Part-time staff are to receive a #proportionate share# and employees in receipt of top-up benefits may experience a #knock-on# effect on entitlements.The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said #many care home workers are part-time, so the fear is that they will end up with a derisory payment#.Let#s also remember that in England and Wales, tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,. In Scotland, our tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,.Le Presidente Nicola and her Sepratista Nationale Politicohave put on something akin to a magic show. The question you may wish to ask yourself, is this worthy of your applause Tommy Macpherson, Saddell.I was disappointed that my amendment, brought to the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Islands Area Committee to retain the underspend of £, designated for Tarbert regeneration improvements, was not supported by Councillor Alastair Redman.I appreciate that the councillors who represent Lochgilphead were keen that the additional monies should top-up the costs of the project at the Front Green as that tender has come in much in excess of the original budget, but it is deplorable that a councillor elected to represent Tarbert chose to vote against the amendment that would have allowed Tarbert to benefit from the funding allocated for improvements in the village.I would assure all residents in Tarbert that I will work for the people of Tarbert, who elected me to represent them in the best way I can.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands.Being a previous resident in the Wee Toon, and now residing in Helensburgh, I totally agree that Campbeltown and all other rural places in Argyll, should have been moved to tier one a couple of weeks ago.Helensburgh has had its tier two status challenged recently by sailors from Faslane in several groups going to the boozers and buying #substantial# meals with several beers, but are classed as being from the same household due to being on the same ship.Also #Weegies# getting the short train journey from Glasgow and breaching the travel rules to infest the area unlawfully.We are the closest town to the Covid hot spots, which certainly doesn#t help matters.I hope Nicola Sturgeon sees sense and allows all rural places in Argyll to be exempt from the harsh restrictions that are unfairly spread over the whole of the region.Name and address supplied.I see Bruno Tonioli is pocketing £, a minute during his current appearances on Strictly Come Dancing which equates to a further  free TV licences for the over s.Is it any wonder the BBC has a problem with those of us refusing to pay the licence fee of £. when it can pay mouth-watering sums to endless so-called celebrities.I realise the BBC has a duty to honour contracts but perhaps honouring previous pledges to OAPs over  would be a way forward.I also see water bills are likely to increase every year for the next six years, adding an average increase in council tax bills of £ per annum.Seeing as it seems to have rained every day since October in this part of the world, I begin to wonder how water companies can equate this increase to all citizens who have no alternative other than to pay.Perhaps internal budgeting within these companies could well be a sensible solution.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.We are launching the Young People’s Board for Change, and want to recruit  members aged between  and  years, from across the country.The board members will use the  to raise awareness of what matters most to them, take action and make change happen.

Well, as the Native Americans might say, #the story might not necessarily be true, but it is full of truth#.However you view this, something wonderful happened on a starry night over , years ago # something too wonderful to explain in simple words. The ordinary merged with the extraordinary and hope was born.The ordinary and the extraordinary became the midwe of our faith.One explanation could be that Jupiter and Saturn were in alignment on that starry night so long ago.What do astronomers make of this idea Tim O#Brien, associate director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, suggests this would have looked striking.#It#s remarkable how much your attention is drawn when two very bright objects come together in the sky,# he explains.And once the planets lined up in their orbits, Earth would #overtake# the others, meaning that Jupiter and Saturn would appear to change direction in the night sky. A wandering star I invite you to look to the south west about an hour after sunset on the winter solstice, December .You may see something that has not happened for  years. Jupiter and Saturn will come so close together that it will look just like one giant, amazing star.Could this astronomical display of beauty have happened around the time of Jesus#s birth I believe God uses nature to speak to us, and the more time we spend learning about the wonders of nature, the closer we come to God."},{"url":null,"title":"msp presses for detail on football funding","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Last Saturday, he paid a visit to Glenbarr, touring through the village on a sleigh towed by a tractor covered in fairy lights in place of his reindeer, which were resting before Christmas Eve.He was joined by an elf who helped him give sweets to the many children who turned out to see him.He then travelled over to Islay to deliver presents and sweets to children with the help of more elves, island firefighters, volunteers and staff from Bruichladdich Distillery.Councillor Alastair Redman, who saw Santa during his visit to Islay, said: #A huge thanks to everyone involved.

It can be portrayed as kitsch, comic, romantic, violent, fantastical, gritty, historic or contemporary and its characters can be ordinary, terrying or inspiring.#Scotland can be gloriously Scottish or it can be the coast of Turkey, the wilderness of Nova Scotia or even the surface of Jupiter. With such a reputation, we can be sure that film-makers will continue to come to Scotland to use our spectacular landscape in telling their stories.#The programme also tells how Gene Kelly came to Scotland to find a location for the famous musical film, Brigadoon, but it was too wet so they decided to film on a Hollywood sound stage instead.Viewers will be transported to Glenfinnan Viaduct in Inverness-shire. Made famous worldwide by the Harry Potter films, the viaduct attracts thousands of tourists.They will also learn that an archaeologist discovered a star map beneath the spectacular pinnacle of the Old Man of Storr on the Isle of Skye which starts the mission to discover the origins of humankind in Ridley Scott’s  film Prometheus.Michelle Pfefer is filmed at the Quiraing and the Fairy Pools in Skye in Stardust, Mel Gibson’s Braveheart rebellion was filmed in Glen Nevis near Fort William, and scenes in Rob Roy were filmed in Glencoe with the Three Sisters mountains often in the background.The programme also reveals Eilean Donan Castle was the headquarters of the warlike Clan MacLeod in the cult fantasy Highlander. It also featured in romantic comedy Made of Honour, while the Highland Games in that movie was filmed at Dunvegan Castle on Skye.The opening battle scene in the film Highlander was filmed at Buachaille Etive Mòr and Buachaille Etive Beag at the entrance of Glencoe, and the  film The Kidnappers, set in a Scots colony in Cape Breton, was filmed in Glen Affric.The classic Scottish comedy The Maggie introduced the Crinan Canal and Islay’s Bowmore and Port Askaig to international cinema audiences.Other film locations that feature include Mull in the  classic novel I Know Where I’m Going and When Eight Bells Toll, and Iona in art house film Iona which gave Sorcha Groundsell her first major acting role.Entrapment, featuring Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery, was filmed at Duart Castle on Mull, and a scene for the popular family classic Ring of Bright Water was filmed a few miles outside Oban the house where Bill Travers’ character lived is still nearby.Cinema Gadelica was produced by Caledonia TV for BBC ALBA and is available now on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":null,"title":"district news december 25 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But a spokesman for Argyll and Bute NHS Trust said: ‘To date we have been fortunate that it would not appear to be an epidemic.’Typical symptoms of influenza include fever, headaches, aches and pains, running nose, a sore throat and coughs. Sufferers can also feel very weak and sweat during exertion.According to Argyll and Clyde Health Board’s consultant in public health medicine, Dr David Sloan, most people with the flu do not need to see the doctor.He said: #For most people, a dose of the flu is best treated by retiring to bed, taking something for aches and pains and waiting until it passes in four to seven days, usually.#But he added that people who are severely affected or who may get complications should see a doctor sooner rather than later.Single le over in KintyreThe last shop in Kintyre selling top  singles plans to pull them from its shelves shortly.

After years of the charity campaigning, on December , the UK Government announced the framework for a future Online Harms Bill that has the potential to provide much greater protection for children when they use the internet.This is a landmark moment – a major step towards legislation that can make an enforceable legal duty of care on tech companies a reality. For too long children have been exposed to disgraceful abuse and harm online.Social media companies will have a duty to protect young users from child abuse and harmful content online and face fines of up to £ million or  per cent of their global turnoverthey fail.But that doesn’t mean that the work we do stops now. For instance, the proposals fall short of ensuring criminal sanctions against named directors whose companies fail to uphold their duty of care.Child protection and children’s voices must remain front and centre of regulatory requirements. We have set out six tests for robust regulation – including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions.Failing to pass any of the six tests will mean that future generations of children will pay with serious avoidable harm and sexual abuse.We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests. Above all, legislation must ensure Ofcom has the power and resources to enforce the duty of care and be able to identy and then take appropriate action against tech firms that fail.For more information, search ‘NSPCC six tests’.Joanna Barrett, policy and public affairs manager, NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown restrictions force cinemas closure","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There were lots of amazing houses decorated # far more than usual.#Mandy described the feedback from the Hallowe#en event as #fantastic#, with many requests for a Christmas-themed walk.As her nieces were both too busy to organise this themselves # Shannon sitting university examinations in Glasgow and Heather running her own online craft business # Mandy decided to take the reins.#My other niece, Anna Brodie, volunteers with me at The Hub, so we decided we would take this on so everyone could still participate,# Mandy said. #There has been a fantastic response once again.#We have  homes and businesses included on the map with an activity sheet on the reverse. The homes that have participated are amazing # I think there is an element of friendly neighbourhood competition too!#Christmas is such a special time, so we wanted to give people another chance to get together while being out and about, making it a special event instead of just going a run round in the car.#Looking at the light shows outside people’s homes was something I always did when my boys were small.

One of the most popular is to buy some tall candles, shave them around the base so they are thin enough to fit into the opening of the bottle, then simply let the candle burn down so that the wax drips down in a rustic fashion.Alternatively, you can use old fabric to stitch together a Santa hatto sit over the bottle as a festive centrepiece. And, of course, you donrsquot have to use wine bottles ndash any bottle will do.. Make decoupage Christmas cardsRequiring much more effort than just picking up a multipack of Christmas cards, decoupage is a great way to show that you care.There are plenty of designs that you can get online , but you will need a steady hand and lots of patience to cut out and stack each inidual layer.Itrsquos a great task to do with older kids, getting them to use their hand-eye coordination on something other than a games console, with a real sense of accomplishment when you see the finished version.Just make sure to leave enough time to send them out before the final Christmas posting dates .Christmas is just around the corner. Go foraging for rustic decorationsOne of the best things to come out of lockdown is that most of us have gained a renewed sense of appreciation for the outdoors.With rustic decorations firmly back in fashion, why not use your next woodland walk as an opportunity to pick up some greenery to add to your home  Holly and ivy can be found across the country, particularly in oak and beech woodland, with holly branches traditionally used to decorate homes while serving as a charm against witches.You can also thread greenery through bannisters, or to dress your table for Christmas day, with eucalyptus and mistletoeadding a delicate touch. Herbs like rosemary look great on top of Christmas cakes, while pinecones can be fun for kids to find and then paint before displaying in a jar or a basket.. Create a mini Christmas tree from plastic spoonsIt might sound tacky, but a mini tree made from plastic spoons can look surprisingly classyyou do it right.Simply pick up a multipack of disposable plastic spoonsand then cut off the circular spoon heads and discard the handles.From there, paint or decorate the spoon circles before gluing them in layers to a kitchen roll or similar base to create a fanned Christmas tree shape. You can even make a spoon trees of dferent sizes and display them together for a charming decoration.Find out more here.. Decoratefestive candleCandle sales have soared in the UK in the last few months, as we seek to make the dark nights spent at home feel warmer, cosier and more lsquohyggersquo. And as demand rises so does the prices, with some branded scented candles costing hundreds of pounds.But therersquos no need to spend a fortune. Instead, you can pick up some plain inexpensive candles and then decorate them yourself- getting all of the visual impact for a fraction of the price.The options are pretty much endless when it comes to decoration: you can paint the candle, add glue then sprinkle it with glitter, tie ribbons or seasonal herbs around the outside, stick on jewels or embellishments, use a template to trace on a designhellip we could go on.You can also make the candle itself from scratch and add your own scents, but you will need to buy wax, wicks and fragrance oils to do so.. Distil your own Christmas ginThe craft gin boom of recent years has seen no shortage of gins vying for your attention in the alcohol aisle. Butyou want to really impress this Christmas, why not distil your own Therersquos plenty of sets containing dried botanicals that you can buy online, or acquire independently, with some of the most popular being orange peel, peppercorn, cardamom, cinnamon, liquorice or rose petals.You can add whatever combinations of botanicals you like but, to qualy as a gin, juniper must be the most dominant botanical and the spirit must be at least .% ABV.All you really need to do is get a glass bottle or jar, add your chosen combination of botanicals and then top with quality vodka. Leave your infusion in a dark cupboard for around a week, shaking it once a day, then sieve out the botanicals to leave you with your gin.Experiment with some festive flavours for an extra bit of pizzazz.. Create some frosty branchesThese are incredibly easy and cheap to make despite being sold for signicantly more in most garden centres. Gather some branches or twigs from outside, prune them into the shape that you want and then spray paint them gold or silver. Then fill a plastic tub with glitter, add glue to your branches and dip them in the glitter before leaving to dry. Itrsquos best to do this all outside to minimise mess- so make sure the weather is dry while you do so. Once your frosty branches are complete you can either display them outside or in a vase indoors- they look particularly good when illuminated by a candle or the twinkle of Christmas lights.Get the tutorial here.. Make peppermint candy canesLegend has it that candy canes were invented by a Cologne choirmaster in the th century who wanted to remind children of the role of shepherds in the story of the nativity.From there they spread throughout Europe, now becoming one of the most popular decorations for our homes at Christmas. The good news is that they are reasonably easy to bake, meaning the whole family can get involved, while also requiring very few ingredients.Simply mix peppermint extract with dferent colours of pre-bought icingand then make two long sausages containing each colour.Twist the sausages together, slice into smaller pieces, mould into the desired hook shape and then leave them to set on a baking tray for  hours. Then, either eat your candy canes or use them as decorations.Get recipe inspiration here.Make your own fake snow!. Make fake snowDespite listening to songs about it every year, a white Christmas is actually pretty rare, with the last widespread one in Britain coming back in .But with no snow guaranteed outside, you can still create your own with just a handful of ingredients that you are likely to have lying around the house.Kids will love joining in and mixing the snow through their hands- so be sure to get them involved. Simply mix together equal measures of cornflour and bicarbonate of soda in a bowl, slowly adding water while mixing it together with your hands.Yoursquoll know yoursquove got the right consistency when the lsquosnowrsquo can hold its own shape while still being easily remodelled. Alternatively, you can mix the cornflour with hair conditioner or shaving cream for a similar effect.. Make your own e-cardPersonalised cards are currently all the rage. But rather than shelling out for cards on personalisation websites, you can photoshop photos of your loved ones onto a range of festive backgrounds that are available online for free.Most of these templates require only basic skills to use and once yoursquove made them, you can either print them out or send in an email to avoid wasting paper- keeping your Christmas carbon footprint down.Try here."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-strict-new-christmas-rules-level-4-coming-east-lothian","story":"In an announcement on Saturdayevening, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that the plans to relax rules for five days over the Christmas period could no longer take place in any part of Scotland due to the emergence of a new strain of Covid- which can spread up to  per cent more easily than previous strains.The key points set out by the First Minister are:In her statement, the First Minister described the situation as the most serious juncture since the start of the pandemic.She said: \"If we dont act firmly and decisively now, [the new strain of the virus] will take hold here.\"By January, our NHS could potentially be overwhelmed... it would mean many more people dying from this virus than would otherwise have been the case.\"Its important that we take the warning we are being given now very seriously.\"If we do act now, we have a chance of keeping the situation under control.\"She stated that she understood that, due to the fact Scotlands case numbers were currently not as high as those in England and Wales, many people would question why the strict new rules were being brought in, but she said it was critical to act now to stop the situation rapidly spiralling out of control.On the travel ban from other parts of the UK, she stated: \"That ban will remain in place right throughout the festive period.\"We simply cannot allow the risk of this strain travelling from other parts of the UK.\"Although she said that indoor mixing in a bubble would still be allowed on Christmas Day, she urged people to avoid even thatpossible, stating: \"Our advice is still not to meet indoors, even on Christmas Day,you can possibly avoid it.\"On Christmas Day, she said the law was that no more than eight people from no more than three households would be allowed to meet indoors.She also said that, although travel between dferent parts of Scotland would be allowed on Christmas Day, staying overnight would not be, telling those who would need to do so not to travel at all.And she added that immediately after the end of Christmas Day, the strictest Level  measures would apply for all mainland Scotland for a minimum of three weeks.

I was always mesmerised by how quickly the rough landscape changed into a white wonderland like from the most beautul fairy tale. This was also the time that I associated with countless presents . Who does not like them !Now I still adore winter but for dferent reasons, namely for its wildle visitors to the country. Last month, I introduced you to one of them ndash the short-eared owl ndash and now it is time I presented my favourite winter migrant: the Bohemian waxwing.The sight of a waxwing can brighten up any winter day, regardless of how keen on birding you are. Two years ago, I was privileged to spend a fantastic afternoon with these birds.It was a chilling but sunny day. As my dad, who is a nature lover, was visiting me for Christmas, I took the opportunity to take him on a trip to Aberlady. This place is always rich in all sorts of wildle. I also knew that some waxwing sightings had been recorded earlier that week.As soon as we arrived, I spotted a rather big flock of birds that briefly circulated above our heads before disappearing towards the reserve. Everything happened so fast that I did not have enough time to pick up my binoculars for a closer look at the birds.We rushed towards a copse of rowan trees, where I knew the waxwings would most likely congregate. As we were coming closer, I could recognise the merry trill that these stunning birds make as they were happily feeding on berries. You may remember from my previous articles how careful I am when it comes to approaching wildle. This time was no dferent we took our time watching the waxwings from a distance, letting them get used to our presence. This is a great technique to signal to wildle that we are no threat to them.Suddenly, the flock was spooked by a dog and raised high in the sky for a split second before landing above our heads. My dad and I gave each other a knowing grin and started admiring the beautul creatures sitting merely a couple of metres away from us. This was an unusual moment to me as a wildle photographer: the birds were so close that my lens was too big to capture the scene! But that picture of waxwings having a feast right above me will stay in my memory for a long time.Waxwings are often mistaken for common starlings. These two species are similar in size and, to an extent, profile.However,you look closely, you should spot the peach-brown colouring of waxwingsrsquo plumage. An even closer look will reveal the real charm and beauty that these birds possess: the enlivening neutral base colours are accompanied by splashes of white and red in the wings and a strong yellow band at the base of the tail. The head is crowned by a distinctive crest, which can be raised or lowered depending on the birdrsquos mood. Adding to their appeal is the prominent black mask on their eyes.Waxwings are gregarious birds, who can form large flocks consisting of hundreds of iniduals. They breed in boreal forest that extends from Scandinavia through Russia and across to the Pacic coast.Waxwings are a forgiving subject to photograph they do not encounter humans within their breeding habitats, therefore are approachable on their winter grounds, providing a great opportunity to capture them feeding on colourful berry trees.Waxwings make a loud but cheerful trill as they scour the landscape looking for fruit.Berries are incredibly important for waxwings in the winter. These birds can eat up to twice their body weight, which makes around -, berries a day!Their diet changes during their breeding season as the birds switch to feeding on mosquitoes and midges.Our native rowan is their favoured tree, but they will happily feed on hawthorn, cotoneaster and rosehips as well as dried fruit.If waxwings are in the area and you do not have berries, they can be attracted into gardens using apple halves hung from a tree. It is common to spot waxwings in such ordinary places as supermarket car parks, as they often have ornamental shrubs with berries.This was my first year writing Zanrsquos Wildle Diary and I have greatly enjoyed sharing my stories and experiences with you. I hope you all had fun reading my column!If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have Wildle Calendars  for sale.

To sit at home, glued to the news and feel the anxiety rise like millions of other Scots. But thatrsquos not the Janey Godley way.Instead, the Glasgow comedian and actor began a series of voiceovers: her take on First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos daily coronavirus briefing. The result was informative and hilarious as Godley imparted key messages in easy-to-understand, bite-sized clips. She went viral for talking about a virus.Memorable moments include a sweary outburst about former chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood ldquobending the rules by visiting her second home in Fe during lockdown and advising listeners that there should be ldquonae rumpy pumpy between couples living in dferent households.Godley ended each video with her catchphrase ldquoFrank, get the door!

Captain Sir Tom Moorersquos sudden rise to national-treasuredom speaks volumes about the year wersquove battled through and what we looked to as symbols of hope.In a period in which we lost so many elders, a centenarian became a magnet for both fame and donations. In a time when the NHS felt under threat, he channelled a desire out there to support it and each other.Moorersquos journey started on April , when just a few weeks into lockdown, at the age of , he began to walk laps of this garden as a fundraiser for NHS Charities Together.The idea was that he would raise pound, by his th birthday ndash which was at the end of the month.In those  days he became a superstar as well as raising more than pound million. His was a message of optimism. ldquoFor all those finding it dficult, he said, ldquothe sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away.:Forensic pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy on her le at the frontline of deathMoore was a man who remembered the Blitz and somehow embodied that spirit of stoicism, community and solidarity.The disease may have shone a light on the inequality in our country, but Moore touched on something we all felt for a moment ndash that we were in it together, and we could help each other.The money, of course, didnrsquot stop flooding in, and the fame didnrsquot stop growing. Over the year he became the first centenarian to have a number one chart hit with his cover version of Yoursquoll Never Walk Alone, published his autobiography, Yoursquoll Never Walk Alone and was knighted by the queen ndash though really, to most of us, he was just Captain Tom.By the time the campaign closed, it had topped pound,,. ldquoIrsquom absolutely overawed, he said in ainterview earlier this month. ldquoNever in  years did I anticipate this would happen to me ndash that my name would go around the world.Andrew CotterSports broadcaster Andrew Cotterrsquos wry commentary about his dogs Olive and Mabel was a much-needed tonic during lockdown. The clips went viral, winning fans around the globe.Cotter, who comes from Troon, Ayrshire and is a regular on the BBC, has written a heart-warming memoir, Olive, Mabel and Me, about their adventures.Len PennieIt is nigh-on impossible not to feel a surge of patriotism at Len Penniersquos Scots Word of the Day. Fe-based Pennie ndash better known to her k Twitter followers as Miss Punny Pennie and @lenniesaurus ndash is a passionate ambassador for the preservation of Scots language.The self-described ldquowarrior poet held together wae spite and duct tape penned and performed Irsquom No Havinrsquo Children, a love letter to ldquoa proud ancient language and one dedicated to the strength of her own mother. Well worth a listen.Dr Kenneth BaillieWhere would we be without the research  It is at the heart of our battle against the virus ndash and the intensive care specialist, Dr Kenneth Baillie, and the lab he leads at the Roslin Institute, has done groundbreaking work.He led, for instance, the recently published, ground-breaking GenOMICC study, which showed genetic associations with critical Covid and that those with particular genes were more likely to get it badly.He also co-led an earlier study which found risk factors for the disease such as obesity and diabetes, and created a prognostic score ndash and he contributed to the set-up and delivery of the RECOVERY trial, which found the first effective treatment, dexamethasone.ldquoI think, he told The Herald last week, ldquomy most striking memory of this year will be all of the willingness of everyone to step forward and help wherever needed.

Sridhar became a kind of public health superstar, speaking out against the ldquoherd immunity approach.In March, she was one of a group of professors who signed a letter to the Lancet criticising the UKrsquos approach to the pandemic, and requesting ldquothat the government urgently and openly shares the scientic evidence, data, and models it is using.She is a member of a group that advises the UKrsquos SAGE team, and one of the experts who advises the Scottish Government.Devi Sridhar, author and professor at the University of Edinburgh. Picture: Roberto Ricciuti Getty ImagesSometimes she came under fire for how outspoken she was ndash for instance, when she issued the tweet, ldquoIt is the tragedy of history that when a serious pandemic hit the world where leadership and good governance were required, Donald Trump was US President and Boris Johnson was UK Prime Minister.Meanwhile, she praised the approach of many of the East Asian countries, which she said, had got it right.What has been clear is that she views the battle against the virus through the prism of equality. Public health, for her, is about all of us ndash and especially the poor, who are set to be hit worst by the virus.Joe WicksThe man who got everyone, and not just the schoolkids, jumping around their living rooms like a kangaroo and doing Spider-Man lunges. Le during lockdown was marked by a number of shared activities ndash and one of them was PE With Joe.Few, certainly, are the families with school-age children who didnrsquot do at least a few Pikachu squats with him. In the months from March to July, when the workouts stopped, he did  PE workouts and had million views, making pound, for the NHS.The nation was working out together ndash though some of us were perhaps not always joining him for the am livestream. They were also being tested for general knowledge, witnessing some daft fancy dress costumes, and following the family journey as Wicks has surgery on his arm and his we, Rosie, stepped in to demonstrate.Joe said in an interview, ldquoPeople now realise they can have a great workout in their living room, or their bedroom or their garden with no equipment, and thatrsquos really what Irsquove been trying to achieve, to make fitness accessible and sustainable for everybody and I really hope that people realise that you donrsquot need an expensive gym membership and loads of equipment to stay fit and healthy ndash thatrsquos really my goal.Monica LennonNowhere  in the world had done it. But, here in Scotland, politicians have not only extensively debated and discussed the Long-taboo subject of periods in our parliament, but passed a bill to provide free and universal access to period products.Monica Lennon, the MSP, who spearheaded a campaign was recently named one of Voguersquos top female leaders who have changed the world. And rightly so. The policy was a first in the world.But also, this four-year campaign got us talking about both poverty and the taboos and stigma around menstruation ndash and at a time when, as a result of the pandemic, poverty is onthe rise.Scottish Labours Monica Lennon. Picture: Gordon Terris The HeraldIt revolutionised the way we talk about periods. As Lennon put it, ldquoA few years ago there had never been an open discussion of menstruation in the Holyrood chamber and now it is mainstream.\"MSPs have enjoyed being a part of that, and it has encompassed the menopause, endometriosis, as well as the types of products we use and their sustainability.Lennon has even suggested that this law could be replicated throughout the world.Professor Sir Geoff PalmerThis year brought not just a pandemic, but a wave of energy for change around racism, and, in the midst of restrictions, Black Lives Matter protests.In the midst of all this, a powerful voice has been that of Professor Sir Geoff Palmer, Jamaican-born and the first black professor in Scotland. His message was, ldquoDonrsquot take down statues ndash take down racism.The statues, he believes, are part of black history. Rather than remove the statue to Henry Dundas, known as the Melville Monument, he suggested ndash and in fact had already been campaigning some years for ndash a plaque to be added describing how Dundas had played a pivotal role in delaying the abolition of slavery by having the word ldquogradual inserted in William Wilberforcersquos motion.Professor Sir Geoff Palmer. Picture: Martin ShieldsAt the Black Lives Matter protest in Holyrood Park, Palmer made one of the key speeches. In an interview with the BBC this summer, he said, ldquoI donrsquot want statues to be taken down. My view is you remove the evidence, you remove the deed. The past has consequences and a lot of people forget that.\"Racism is a consequence of the past. You may take street names away but we have dficulty convincing people about the past. Removing it is very tricky because we are altering history.Margaret PayneCaptain Tom might have done laps of his garden, but Margaret Payne of Ard, aimed for giddier heights and climbed the iconic Scottish mountain, Suilven ndash or at least she climbed its  metre height in ascents of the stairs in her Sutherland home.She had been climbing those steps, for exercise before she heard of Tom Moorersquos laps, and it was her daughter who suggested she do something with it, in terms of fundraising for the NHS. ldquoI said, she recalls, ldquowell why canrsquot I climb Suilven  And thatrsquos how it all started.Payne, who spoke to us just after her st birthday this month, said, ldquoI donrsquot feel I deserve all that Irsquove had in terms of attention, because I feel itrsquos really the people who did the publicity and the people who donated who really deserve the thanks.:Diane Lane on her new film Let Him Go and four decades as an actorldquoI did do the stair-climbing but I feel that was a very small part. My daughter spent hours and hours on the telephone organising things.She chose Suilven because it was a mountain she had climbed in her teens, and, in fact, the only mountain that she had ever climbed ldquoto the very top. ldquoYou see Irsquove had a dicky knee all my le, from the time I was about  and so I never did a lot of hill climbing, though Irsquove done quite a lot of walking.The stair-climbing, however, didnrsquot cause that knee a lot of trouble, though it did make it ache sometimes and she had a couple of days off at one point to allow it to recover.ldquoI thoughtI got pound, I would be doing well, she recalls. ldquoBut the final figure is pound,..Scott McPartlinDigital and phone connectivity has never been more of a leline than it has over the last year, and someone who helped keep that going for many was Scott McPartlin, the customer service engineer who was dubbed ldquoOpenreachrsquos Bear Grylls after he camped out on Coll for three days to restore services to a vulnerable resident there who was shielding.McPartlin was one of those people who went above and beyond the call of duty during lockdown. Since there was no accommodation available, due to restrictions, he pitched a tent.On another occasion, he hiked three miles over a Hebridean beach, carrying his tools during a heatwave. McPartlin wasnrsquot alone in going the extra mile, but he embodied for many the urge that was felt across this country.Marcus RashfordOn January  in an FA Cup third round replay between Manchester United and Wolves, the United striker Marcus Rashford came on as a substitute in the second half. Some  minutes later he went off again after a clash with Matt Doherty.Rashford had suffered a double stress fracture in his back and was going to be out for a while. He was still rehabilitating when football shut down in March during the lockdown.Faced with an extended break from the game, rather than mess around playing Football Manager, the -year-old decided to throw himself into a project close to his heart.In March, he teamed up with the charity FairShare to call for donations for children who would not be receiving free meals because schools were closed.ldquoNo child should have to worry where their next meal is coming from, hepointed out.A Manchester lad, Rashford was one of a family of five raised by their single mum. Money was always a problem. He would hear his mother Melanie cry herself to sleep at nights. In short, he grew up knowing what poverty was.Manchester Uniteds Marcus Rashford. Picture: Nick Potts PA WireNow, in a position of security and influence, he has become the countryrsquos most effective poverty campaigner. In the months that followed his injury, as well as giving his own money to the cause, he spoke out in favour of extending free school meals through school holidays in England over the summer.At first the Westminster government rejected his call before being forced into a U-turn. And when MPs in October voted against extending free school meals through the Christmas holidays, Rashford vowed to continue the fight. ldquoThis is not going away any time soon and neither am I.A month later Boris Johnsonrsquos government caved in, agreeing to introduce a coronavirus winter grant scheme and extend the food programme through next yearrsquos holiday periods in England. .Back in April the health secretary Matt Hancock had a go at Premier League footballers, saying they should take a pay cut and play their part during the pandemic. It was a cheap shot .Rashford, measured, committed and knowledgeable has definitely played his part and shown the government up in the process.Steve ClarkeHow long has it been  Some  years. More than two decades since Scotlandrsquos international football team made it to the finals of a major competition. The last time was , when Craig Brown led Scotland to the World Cup in France.After years of mediocrity, Scotlandrsquos play-off victory in Serbia last month was proof that appointing the former Kilmarnock manager Steve Clarke in May last year was a good one. Some of the football the national team has played under him hasnrsquot always been pretty, but it has been effective.: great Scottish festive books, films, TV shows and songsNow the Tartan Army has, coronavirus vaccine permitting, a chance to see the team play England, the Czech Republic and Croatia next summer ndash which raises a new challenge for Clarke.Can he be the first Scottish manager to guide his team past the group stage in a major competition Or is that asking too much  Next year will give us the answer.Douglas StuartIn more than  years, a Scottish author had only won the Booker Prize once before . James Kelman was awarded it in  for his novel How Late It Was, How Late, a victory that caused no little controversy at the time for its use of vernacular language .It may be a measure of how things have changed that this year a novel about a young, gay boy living with his alcoholic mother narrated in a Glaswegian voice barely raised an eyebrow.It may also be a measure of just what an achievement Douglas Stuartrsquos novel Shuggie Bain is, a deeply felt novel about love, addiction and poverty that has an extra kick because it draws on Stuartrsquos own biography. He grew up in Glasgow in the s not knowing his father and living with his alcoholic mum.After she died, he studied textiles in the Borders before working in the fashion industry in New York.But he always nurtured a desire to be a writer and he worked on Shuggie Bain for more than  years. It was worth the wait.In a red-letter year for Scottish fiction, one that gave us new and powerful work from the likes of Ali Smith, Maggie OrsquoFarrell and Kirstin Innes, Stuartrsquos novel was a reminder of how fiction can let us see ndash and more crucially understand ndash other peoplersquos lives no matter how far removed from our own. Or how close.Dolly PartonWriting more than , songs, one or two of them among the best-known songs in the world, would be quite the legacy for most people. But Dolly Partonrsquos gts to the rest of us extends way beyond that.Dolly PartonIn the s she spoke up in support of HIV Aids groups. In , her charity book gting programme for children, Imagination Library, gave away itrsquos  millionth book.And this year, it emerged that while President Trump was busy downplaying the risk of the coronavirus, Dolly was donating m to fund research into the Moderna vaccine.Joe BidenJoe Biden seems a decent enough sort. Getting on a bit, to be fair, maybe a bit too cautious to make a huge dference politically . But his success in Novemberrsquos US Presidential election should be celebrated as much for what he is not as what he is.Closer in the end than many of us would have liked , Bidenrsquos victory in the election represented a rejection of four years of brutal, nasty, grting, stupid and at times racist leadership by possibly the worst man ever to be President. .:Val McDermid on her odd festive traditions and why she loves a Christmas murder mysteryTrump may or may not go away but Trumpism is not likely to disappear any time soon. He was the culmination rather than the initiator of a deeply populist, aggressive coarsening of politics that has been going on for years, aided by social mediaand fuelled by Russian interference.Itrsquos asking a lot of Joe Biden to somehow reset the American body politic, but hopefully in the short term he can at least give us an example of how a President should behave in office.

Currently, many of us are wrestling with how to safely celebrate Christmas. Therersquos a strong belief that Christmas is a time for being with loved ones.However, for many people, Christmas is dficult it can be joyless and a time of extreme loneliness. As many make plans to see family and friends, those who are alone throughout the year experience increased feelings of isolation. Christmas Day, in particular, can be very lonely for some iniduals.Throughout the pandemic, librarians and library staff have been determined to maintain services for communities by pivoting to create new ways of connecting with and engaging members. They have overcome lockdown restrictions and helped stave off loneliness during what has been an incredibly isolating time.The festive period will be no exception to this. Online library services have strengthened and grown signicantly during  and will continue to be available across the country to support people.Despite experiencing a challenging year themselves, with closures and furlough affecting most services, librarians and library staff are putting on special Christmas activities and services. For example, South Ayrshire libraries have created wonderful Christmas displays to support their Connect  Collect service. In addition, theyrsquore distributing a Winter Wanderland craft pack for children and therersquos an associated scavenger hunt for families, which also involves local shops across the local authority area. In Inverclyde, the library service is collecting letters to Santa and running an online Christmas Bedtime Bookbug Session, as well as hosting a special online visit from Santa on the servicersquos Facebook page.Library services play a vital role in tackling social isolation and loneliness all year round. As trusted public spaces, free to use, they truly are accessible to everyone. They are often described as the living rooms of our communities, offering comfort and a space where people come together.This idea is particularly meaningful during the festive period, and more so this festive period after the year wersquove had.The coronavirus pandemic and its associated restrictions ndash lockdown, social distancing, closure of leisure and hospitality venues, event cancellations ndash has created increased feelings of loneliness and isolation among more people. According to the Mental Health Foundation, which conducted a survey during the first national lockdown, one in fourUK adults said they had experienced feelings of loneliness.We have seen recognition of the value of library services strengthening throughout this year. For example, an unintended, but welcome, consequence of the coronavirus lockdown has been a signicant increase in demand for online library services.Their place at the heart of communities means that libraries are highly attuned to the needs of their communities. They know that, for some, libraries offer a leline.

Once you park up in the car park for the Bracklinn Falls itrsquos a short ndash but admittedly steep ndash climb to the summit of the Crags. The good news is that there are plenty of benches to stop atyou need a rest and once you make it to the top the views are more than worth it. You can see the snow-capped peak of Ben Ledi, arguably looking better in winter than summer, as well as a whole host of other hills, not to mention a great view back down over Callander itself. Once yoursquove taken the obligatory selfie at the summit yoursquoll want to escape the chilly wind and make your way back through the forest path. It can be slippery and steep in places so be sure to wear appropriate footwear and take your time. You can carry on back to the car park or take a detour into the village, with the cosy Deli Ecosse in Ancaster Square servingup much-needed takeaway coffeeand cake.Maxwell Park, PollokshieldsMost of those in the south side of Glasgow will flock to Pollok Park for their Boxing Day walk, descending on the paths near the Highland cattle and Pollok House. Butyou want an altogether more relaxed stroll, it would be well worth your while to try nearby Maxwell Park instead. Its location in the heart of leafy Pollokshields means that this park always feels like a quiet pocket of calm, even during busy periods. Therersquos a charming little duck pond to explore as well as some sections of woodland and garden, but it is small enough in size that it wonrsquot take long to get around. If, therefore, you are feeling a little more energetic, why not combine your loop of Maxwell Park with a walk to Queenrsquos Park in Shawlands  Therersquos no shortage of coffee shops in the streets in-between the two parks where you can pick up a drink to warm you up.River Ness and Ness Islands, InvernessIt might run through the heart of the city, but the River Ness is always a good option for a peaceful walk. Its accessible riverside path makes it popular with cyclists and joggers but it rarely gets too busy, particularlyyou head further along the river towards the Ness Islands. These form a three-mile routeyou loop around themwith picturesque Victorian suspension bridges that you cross to get there. Popular with picnickers in the summer, the islands are just as worthy of a visit in winter, where you can spot wildle among the trees, take a rest on one of the many benches and snap a picture with Inverness Castle in the background. If you are feeling particularly fit you can keep going beyond the river path towards the Great Glen Way, or along the Caledonian Canal.Muasdale Beach, Kintyre, Argyll and ButeHeading to the beach isnrsquot an obvious choice when the weather is cold and the wind is biting. But this picture-perfect Kintyre beach offers panoramic views of Islay and Jura, with drtwood, pebbles and rockpools lining the shore. It is long and narrow, perfect for a short stroll, but you can continue on further along the route of the Kintyre Wayyou feel up to it.Falls of Foyers, Foyers, near Fort AugustusTo get to the viewpoint of the magical Falls of Foyers, the walk is entirely leisurely. You can stroll down the steps to get thereto then enjoy wonderful views of the water tumbling down from above, before venturing down to the lower viewpoint for a dferent perspective. But while it is a short distance, thejourney back up all those stairs is tough on even the fittest of walkers, so stop as many times as you need to in order to catch your breath. It can be slippery too, especially at this time of year, so wear sensible footwear and tread carefully.Whitelee Windfarm, EagleshamWhitelee Windfarm, the largest onshore windfarm in the UK, has become steadily more popular with visitors since it first opened a decade ago. Cyclists frequent its flat paths and mountain biking trails while dog owners and horse riders appreciate the swathes of open moorland thatrsquos on offer. And for those looking for an easy post-Christmas walk, it is an ideal place to go. You can park up near the visitor centreand then head out towards the foot of the first turbine ndash which is quite awe-inducing to stand underneath. From there, therersquos a iety of paths and routes that you can take, walking as far as you feel like, with the loop up to the Blackwood Hill Viewpoint a particularly good option. Therersquos a brief uphill climb, but you will be rewarded with views out to Arran and Ailsa Craig on a clear day.Portencross, North AyrshireTherersquos nothing quite like a sea breeze to shake you out of a hangover. But while Troon and Prestwick might be the more popular options for a seaside walk, those in the know would tell you that it is the small hamlet of Portencross that offers some of the best views in Ayrshire. Its proximity to Arran means it has an unrivalled outlook over the sea to the island, which looks particularly majestic as the sun is going down. Therersquos a car park in Portencross which makes a good starting point for a stroll: from there, head along towards the tiny Portencross castle ndash which had close links with King Robert II ndash before stopping off at the pier which offers wonderful views out to sea and back towards the village. Then simply follow the coastal path as far as you wish, with ious picnic benches dotted along the seafrontyou want to brave the wind while having a sit down.Chatelherault Country Park, HamiltonThe very French name of this Lanarkshire park is owed to Mary Queen of Scots. Duc de Chacirctelleraultwas the title given to James Hamilton, nd Earl of Arran, for his part in arranging the marriage of Mary to the young French prince Francis. The park was the main residence of the Dukes of Hamilton for decades, and although the grand Hamilton Palace has since been demolished their extravagant hunting lodge remains. Modern visitors can admire this wonderful building, located right beside the car park, before wandering further into the park for as long a walk as you feel able for. Therersquos  acres of countryside and woodland and over  miles of routed pathways to explore ndash butyou are nursing a sore head you can always just wander around the outside of the lodge and then head back to the car.Alva Glen, AlloaIt only takes an hour to complete, but the walk round Alva Glen packs in woodland, waterfalls, gorges, caves and a spectacular view out across the Clackmannanshire countryside. Simply start at the signposted Alva Glen car park and head up through the woodland to reach the first of several waterfalls. Soon the path begins to climb steeply , with bridges leading up over the gorge and eventually offering a sublime view out over the glen below. Once you reach the Smugglerrsquos Cave, retrace your steps back to the start.Duchess Wood, HelensburghJust a short walk from the centre of Helensburgh lies the Duchess Wood. It is large enough to feel like you have escaped civilisation, but short enough that you can loop around it in less than an hour. Dogs will love running around and exploring the forest, while kids can enjoy spotting squirrels and birds between the trees."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-can-anyone-explain-postal-service-getting-worse","story":"Four of my long-term friends from North and South Lanarkshire posted Christmas cards to me around two weeks ago.

In this context may I suggest that Christmas is the time to ask ourselves what is the real signicance of the man born two millennia ago in Palestine Jesus reveals to us that what makes us truly human is a radical love for all others without exception. He was empowered by his closeness to his God, a God who is Love, a Love which is so radical, so all-encompassing that it must influence every aspect of the lives of those who take Jesus and his God seriously: personal, communal and political, politics being the only way to remove the structural injustices which are at the root of the aforementioned inequalities.My conclusion  It is time to eliminate both consumerism and sentimentality from Christmas and replace them with a compassion for and solidarity with those who are oppressed and voiceless, who experience poverty, hunger, violence, rejection and abuse because they are dferent.John Milne, Uddingston.MISSING A HOLIDAY IS NO TRAGEDYIS Rosemary Goringliving on a dferent planet to the rest of us  At a time when the nation is facing the probability of another lockdown which will plunge retail, tourism, hospitality, the arts, and countless iniduals into financial meltdown, she shares her desolation about being unable to spend Christmas in Florence.The day after reports reveal alarming statistics concerning the rise in homelessness due to Covid-, Ms Goring is devastated at not being able to go to Edinburgh to see the festive lights.

Think of it like a -page book where every so often a couple of letters randomly switch places as new copies are rushed off the press.Occasionally one of these mutations will confer a lsquoselective advantagersquo - such as making a virus more transmissible. As a general rule in virology, however, the more infectious a virus becomes the more its lethality dwindles.For example, the original  SARS killed around  per cent of people who caught it compared to the new SARS-CoV- version, which has an estimated case-fatality rate somewhere in the region of .-% . But SARS also ran out of steam and no case has been detected anywhere in the world since .A virusrsquo only goal is to be passed on and multiply, which is better achieved by being highly contagious - but not overly deadly.It remains to be seen of course whether this will turn out to be the case for the UK iant, which is estimated to be % more transmissible and as of mid-December was accounting for around % of all new cases in London.The UK and South Africa have experienced a huge surge in cases since the beginning of DecemberThere has been a suggestion that the iant may be more infectious in children after NERVTAG member Professor Neil Ferguson told journalists that the number of cases of the new iant detected in under-s is ldquosignicantly higher ldquothan other strains, but there is currently no published evidence to demonstrate that.: If only taking back control had applied to our borders in a pandemicThe South African mutation, dubbed .YV, has been detected in two locations in Britain - in London and the north-west of England.

But Gordon would not give up and ignored the offer.The Mahdi then made his move on January , , and it did not take long. His forces overwhelmed the palace guard and a group of them rushed to the stairs that led to Gordonrsquos quarters.Gordon was standing at the top. In his right hand was a revolver, his left hand rested on his sword, but he made no move to defend himself.With a shout of ldquoyour time has come, the leader of the rebels flung his spear at Gordonrsquos breast. The others then ran up the stairs and finished the job. According to custom, Gordonrsquos head was cut off and taken to the Mahdi.Then the looting began. The people of the town were stripped of their belongings and everything of value was carried off to the Mahdirsquos treasury.Any citizens found trying to hide their wealth were immediately put to death, although the Mahdirsquos forces were only doing what every conquering force, including the British, has done as long as wars have been recorded.The British government and its armies assumed property taken in war belonged to the British crown by right. Often, the loot was ided among the men according to rank and some of it, famously and controversially, ended up in British museums.The story of General Gordon has always been right at the heart of the issue.Some  years before Khartoum, Gordon was part of the British force that occupied Peking and sacked the summer palace. It is estimated that some . million items were taken.The officer in charge said: ldquoThere was not a room I saw in which half the things had not been taken away or broken in pieces. That officer was the th Earl of Elgin, whose name will be familiar.His father was the man who removed the sculptures from Greece that came to be known as the Elgin Marbles.Remnants of the legendary Gordon story have also ended up in Scotland, and form part of a new exhibition at the National War Museum in Edinburgh.They highlight the controversial and complicated nature of the objects that were taken, purchased, or otherwise collected by military personnel across the British Empire, and the exhibition seeks to examine honestly how the objects were collected and how they came to be in British museums.There are two items in the exhibition connected to General Gordon. One of them is a fragment of stone which is said to have come from the steps on which Gordon was killed.The stone was taken as a memento by Major-General Rudolf von Slatin after the British recapture of Khartoum, mounted in silver and inscribed with the date of Gordonrsquos death: January , .It was then presented to Queen Victoria in .Interestingly, Victoria had also been presented with one of the most famous prizes looted from the Summer Palace in China: a little Pekingese dog that was the first of its breed to come to Britain and was named, with no apparent shame, ldquoLooty.The other object connected to Gordon in the new Edinburgh exhibition is a silver box commemorating his death.The inscription on the lid reads: ldquoThe wood lining of this box is made from part of a shutter taken from a window on the balcony of the governorrsquos place at Khartoum on the steps of which General Gordon was murdered.The box was presented to the Seaforth Highlanders by Captain AA Spottiswoode in  for use in the officersrsquo mess and is now in the regimental museum collections.It is the use in the inscription of that word ldquotaken that highlights the problematic and complicated nature of objects brought back from the colonial conflicts, and the staff at the war museum in Edinburgh say they wanted to tackle it honestly.The new exhibition, Legacies Of Empire, draws on the findings of a major research project, Baggage And Belonging, which is shedding new light on museum collections arising from British military campaigns in Africa and India between  and .The staff behind the project say their aim is to address the complicated and controversial nature of the objects in British collections with the most up-to-date information.Dr Stuart Allan, co-investigator on the project and keeper of Scottish history and archaeology at National Museums Scotland, said he was acutely aware of the conversations and debates taking place around colonial collections.ldquoThis exhibition and the wider research project are, we believe, useful contributions to that discussion, he said.ldquoWe are committed to ensuring that the presentation of colonial and imperial histories and their legacies is based in rigorous and up-to-date knowledge.The question facing every museum, of course, is whether any of the objects should be ed or repatriated in some way. Recently, the Rijksmuseum and Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam said they supported the conclusion of a report that a system should be established for theof objects taken by Dutch colonialists.It could include the -carat diamond that belonged to the Sultan of Banjarmasin and was sent to the Netherlands after his land came under Dutch control at the end of the th century.The diamond is currently on display in the Rijksmuseum.National Museums Scotlandrsquos position on the question is that it is specically not defending the means by which many of the colonial objects were acquired, simply presenting factually the ways in which they ended up in museums. Dr Chris Breward, director of National Museums Scotland, said: ldquoThe development of the collection began in the#th#century and#many of the objects#collected over the following  years reflect imperial and colonial histories. Like many museums, the way that we display and interpret those collections has also historically been shaped by imperial and colonial thinking.ldquoNational Museums Scotland#is committed to presenting the colonial and imperial histories of the collections both transparently and in line with rigorous and up-to-date research.ldquoObjects taken in earlier colonial wars are today the subject of discussions reflecting the dferent perspectives of a erse society, and we are a willing and active participant in these discussions.ldquoThese include arguments for wider access to international cultural heritage and, in some instances,of objects to their country of origin. Formal requests of this kind are considered on a case-by-case basis. No such requests are outstanding.Prominent among the colonial objects on show in the new exhibition is a collection of beautul gold ornaments taken from Ghana during the Third Anglo-Asante War from -.There is a gold plate with a beaten decoration there is a remnant of what was probably a chair and there is a delicate feathered gold plate that was probably worn as a decoration.Beaten gold ornaments had an important role to play in Asante court regalia.The ornaments were seized by the British as part of a forced indemnity against the Asante King, Kofi Karikari. The kingrsquos palace was looted and demolished and he was forced to pay the British , ounces of gold, which was then distributed according to British military customs and regulations.The British used several systems to process property seized in this way. Its value could be ided as ldquoprize money for sharing according to rank or it could be seized as ldquoindemnity in compensation for acts of resistance to British imperial power.The gold that has ended up in Edinburgh was bought in  by the jeweller Garrard through the armyrsquos prize system and was bought by National Museums Scotland the following year.Some of the other objects in the collection tell slightly dferent stories. There is an ornate silver club that belonged to Kunwar Singh, a leader of the Indian Uprising in Bihar in -.The club was taken by General Godfrey Pearse, who added a plaque proclaiming it to be spolia opima, which is Latin for rich spoils and a reference to the ancient Roman tradition of the victor taking the arms and armour of an enemy commander as a trophy.Taking trophies in this way was common practice. In British and other European military cultures, the taking of trophies on the battlefield was considered a right of the victor.The trophies were taken and kept by iniduals, but often became the communal property of regiments and other military organisations. Symbolically powerful objects were frequently set aside and presented to the reigning monarch or the military commander.The silver club was donated to National Museums Scotland by Pearcersquos descendants in .Another of the most striking objects in the new exhibition is the sword once owned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. The emperor presented the sword to Colonel Sir John Macdonald, who was prominent in the victory of British imperial forces in the Second Anglo-Maratha War in .The gt was tactical and was made by Shah Allam II to re-establish an alliance with the British following his neutral stance in the conflict.But the concept of it as a ldquogt has to be seen in the context of the British military domination. The sword was bequeathed to National Museums Scotland in  by Macdonaldrsquos descendants.Some of the other objects on show at the war museum have slightly dferent stories.Therersquos an exquisite collection of early Greek jewellery, for example, which was uncovered by British troops digging trenches in northern Greece during the First World War.Robert Gaddie, an amateur archaeologist from Edinburgh, excavated the bronze armlets, spiral brooch, and beads at a site called Chauchitza. The jewellery was transferred to National Museums Scotland in . As for the objects connected to General Gordon, they are typical of the kind of material that was often collected by soldiers as a memento of their experiences.Following important victories, and sometimes defeats, military personnel placed high emotional value on mementos connected to the event, the place or a person, such as Gordon.The objects were often modied with elaborate commemorative mounts and inscriptions and were preserved through the generations by regiments or military organisations. Many, such as the stone and wood from Khartoum, became symbols of martyrdom, honour or sacrice.In the modern age, they are more complicated and controversial. There are some who take the view that any objects acquired through war or violence should be ed.Glasgow councillor Graham Campbell, who has a special interest in museums, has said that there is no doubt that museums should be giving stuff back.ldquoBut really itrsquos about the stories, he said. ldquoIf having the artacts is any use, yoursquove got to have a story that tells the truth about where it came from.The National War Museum says that is its aim with the new exhibition. It recognises that some of the objects are controversial.It accepts that one day some, or all of it, may be ed to the places they came from. But in the meantime, the least it can do is tell, truthfully, the stories of blood and violence and domination behind them.Legacies Of Empire is at the National War Museum in Edinburgh Castle until spring . The museum is closed from Boxing Day due to national coronavirus restrictions.

This huge nation might have been where coronavirus originated, but itrsquos not for that reason alone that it will be making news in  and beyond.It was former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who coined the mantra ldquohide brilliance, cherish obscurity for Chinarsquos foreign policy, but there has been precious little of that approach implemented by current leader Xi Jinping.Instead, Xi has set out unequivocally to make sure Beijingrsquos weight is felt around the world.While all eyes were on Wuhan and Covid-, China was still pushing on relentlessly with its ldquowolf warrior diplomacy. Australia was economically bludgeoned into line for daring to raise the issue of an inquiry into the origins of the virus, while a new security law in Hong Kong brushed aside the terms of the treaty governing the cityrsquos handover to the UK. Beijing is not fearful of throwing its weight around and that is sure to be a regular storyline next year.Writing in last weekrsquos Financial Times, journalist Ryosuke Harada outlined how as ldquoWestern countries flounder in the face of the pandemic and face challenges to their own democracies, China has pulled ahead by containing the disease through technology and authoritarian rule.As Harada sees it, itrsquos not hard to imagine that ldquoin five years time, Chinarsquos ambitions and technological progress, particularly in mitigating climate change, will determine the state of the world.Hardly surprising, then, that most international observers agree that next year Chinarsquos rise and future direction will give us continued headlines, especially over trade and relations with the US under the new presidency of Joe Biden.In short, Xi Jinping will continue to remake the landscape of global politics and all eyes will be on not only how he goes about it, but on how Bidenrsquos incoming administration will manage the bilateral relationship with Bejing.And speaking on a wider footing of related issues to US foreign policy, one of the other stories to look out for will be the extent to which America decides to re-engage generally on the world stage.Biden will have his work cut out for him whether it be with old adversaries like China and Russia or allies and friends like the EU and Nato, with whom Trump has left him to pick up the pieces of treaties, agreements and trust.In Russiarsquos case it was curious to see how long it took president Vladimir Putin to congratulate Biden on his election victory, a hesitancy designed to put maximum pressure on the US president-elect.ldquoItrsquos classic Putin, observed Konstantin Eggert, a well-known Russian journalist and political commentator recently on US National Public Radio ldquoBy not congratulating Biden for so long, he ndash in his eyes at least ndash proved that hersquos tough, hersquos strong, and,need be, hersquos ready to take the fight all the way to Washington.Whether that fight escalates once Biden sits in the Oval office remains to be seen but it will undoubtedly also form part of this coming yearrsquos dominant foreign news themes.So much, then, for some of what might sit on the horizon, but what about those stories that have already been unfolding over the past months but been overshadowed by the pandemic and pushed to the side of our news radar Well, still on Russia, Moscowrsquos role in Belarus, a country often described as Europersquos last dictatorship, was worth noting this year.While an estimated , people are thought to have been arrested since the August election for opposing the rule oflong-time president Alexander Lukashenko, he remains in power with Russiarsquos help, many observers insist.So is the Kremlinrsquos role in ldquoresolving ndash for the time being at least ndash the short-lived war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, which passed many of us by as did the bloody events that played out there.The role of Turkeyrsquos involvement in the region also saw the laying down of an evermore obvious marker from Ankara by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.As Paul Taylor, contributing editor at Politico magazine only half joking remarked last week: ldquoItrsquos time to talk Turkey.He was, of course, referring in all seriousness to the need for a joint approach to reining in what many now see as Erdoganrsquos dangerous adventurism in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Caucasus, and the need for this to be high on the EUrsquos list of priorities with the incoming Biden administration.Here again is another international story that did not make the headlines it should have in  because of the pandemic. For throughout the time that most countries were preoccupied with the domestic implications of the virus and the economic crisis it presented on their own soil,  saw Turkey under Erdogan intensy efforts to project Ankararsquos influence far beyond its own borders.As many sources have highlighted ndashevenfew of us really noticed ndash for the past  months, during the timescale of the pandemic, Erdogan has brought Turkeyrsquos presence to bear on so many of the worldrsquos flashpoints.To begin with, Ankara has intervened militarily in Libyarsquos civil war with arms supplies, drones and Syrian mercenaries to tilt the balance of power in favour of the Tripoli government.Turkey has also under Erdoganrsquos rule prevented US-mandated French and German ships on a EU mission to enforce an arms embargo on Libya from inspecting Turkish cargo ships in the Central Mediterranean.And then, in turn, Turkey also aided and abetted Azerbaijan in recapturing territory around the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave from Armenia. In short: Turkey has become a global powerbroker that will continue to make big headlines ahead ndash and how it plays off Russia and America will be well worth keeping an eye on.And while wersquore on the subject of other headlines gone almost unnoticed this year, watch as details surface of what has really unfolded in terms of human rights violations during the recent conflict between Ethiopia and the Tigray region.If evidence is corroborated of locals describing civilians ldquoslaughtered like chickens then it will stand as a stark reminder of the importance of independently veried news reports and access on the ground in a year awash with disinformation and limited access to many stories.And before I forget, much closer to home ndash here in Europe ndash it has been a dficult  and one the EU has come out of better than might have been expected a few months ago.Yes, I know the UKrsquos Brexit debacle rumbles on, but at least on some fronts, like budget, the EU managed some agreement at the yearrsquos end after so much acrimony and disunity from some members.But again this is a story only just entering a new chapter in .As with every yearrsquos end and the look backwards and forwards over world news, Irsquom often asked to make predictions. Indeed, as  comes to a close, the usual mandate for end-of-year reflections carries a particular weight.As for , it goes without saying that some of the themes and stories Irsquove outlined, whether connected directly to the pandemic or not, will all in some form inevitably be shaped by it.On the widest possible scale, the coronavirus crisis has forced a review of societies and economies, a situation labelled the ldquoGreat Reset by the World Economic Forum . In many ways events of  have exposed the transnational brokenness of so many institutions riddled with injustice and systems ill-equipped to handle compounding disasters.It has also revealed the glaring weakness in capitalism and democracy all over the world and these themes too will doubtless make for many of the global stories of  and beyond. As the old news business saying goes ldquonews never sleeps and certainly not cross the globe.But letrsquos not forget that alongside bad news often comes good news. The rolling out of the coronavirus vaccine is a point in case. So, too, is the fact that in the very same  that saw a terrible global pandemic, Africa was able in August to declare itself free from wild polio, another virus that cost humanity dearly.It was a story many of us will undoubtedly have missed but which Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation , described as ldquoone of the greatest public health achievements of our time.Herersquos to  being full of many more positive stories like this.I wish you a safe and peaceful New Year wherever in the world you might be."},{"url":null,"title":"talking-rabbish-rab-mcneil-just-stayed-hotel-certainly-wasnt-pleasure","story":"Thatrsquos true, mostly, but on this occasion Irsquod no alternative. It wasnrsquot for pleasure, though I tried making the most of it.Nor, needless to say, was it anything plush, but a ldquobudget hotel,not the worst of them.Indeed, it was rather fine, once you got the hang of it. I used to spend considerable time in hotels. For some reason, too, newspapers back in the day insisted on booking a fellow into posh ones when on a job, though mostly Irsquod have preferred a BB.This time, though, I wanted more anonymity I didnrsquot want to wear the mask of joviality.However, I indulged in merry banter with the pleasant chap behind the desk, who even had the decency to laugh uproariously when my sleeve caught the plaster Santa on the counter and smashed it to the floor.There are no keys to the rooms now, only cards.Irsquod used these in the distant past, and almost always had to call the fire brigade to afford me ingress. No such problems this time although, once inside, I couldnrsquot get the lights to come on. I was about to summon a constable when I noticed a wee berth into which fitted the aforementioned card and ndash hey, presto! ndash on came the lights. Whatever will they think of next Dinner didnrsquot go quite so well. The restaurant wasnrsquot open, and the local chippie was shut, so Irsquod to settle for corner shop sandwiches. Still, once Irsquod got my whisky and PG Wodehouse novel out, it wasnrsquot so dferent from being at home, except everything was clean and tidy.Often, when Ito my hovel from a hotel or BB, my heart sinks at the mess. How does it get like this  Sometimes, I spend hours sitting in a chair, wondering why my house is so untidy.Itrsquos then that I start fantasising about staying permanently in a hotel.

Not even the normal hubbub you get in hospitals.Afterwards, I was again walking alone up the incline to the station, on the long, final stretch, past where the tube has doglegged right, glancing down at my paper .I was on my side of the ide, the red side, and when I looked up ahead a tiny figure, at least  metres away, was walking on the same side towards me.I looked down at the ground, checking I was in the right lane, pushed my paper inside my pocket and when I looked up after no more than a second or so the figure had disappeared.

Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to practical provide advice on keeping your birds safe from infection.“Public health advice remains that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Government committed then to help producers in case of severe disruption – now it is time we saw what support will be forthcoming. This week may be just a foretaste of the challenges coming in the new year, deal or no deal, so it is essential that our businesses can have a measure of confidence from the Government.”Shetland MSP, Beatrice Wishart said: “This is an incredibly serious situation. While reasonable public health measures are needed to control the spread of the virus, the government must do all it can to ensure island food exporters can get their perishable goods to market, at what is the busiest time of the year.“Michael Gove told me at a committee session last week that, for seafood exports after Brexit, government #will ensure that, in Kent, we do not have the type of traffic disruption that some have feared#. This disruption does not bode well for the end of the transition period in a just over a week’s time. The UK Government must urgently organise an extension to mitigate economic damage and help our vital food and drink businesses.”Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur said: “Businesses across the Highlands and Islands simply can’t afford to contend with the level of disruption in exports currently being seen. Any delay in exporting perishable goods risks dire consequences for businesses in Orkney, already having to cope with tight deadlines.“At the end of the most challenging of years, further financial turmoil is the last thing small businesses in the islands need heading into . The UK Government’s determination to press ahead with Brexit at any and all cost appears utterly reckless.“The very least that businesses across the Highlands and Islands deserve is support to mitigate the economic impact they face.

No inter-island ferries are operating on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.OIC chief executive John Mundell said: #With no recent cases of COVID- in Orkney — and with strict restrictions on travel in and out of the county due to come into force — we believe this is a proportionate and safe move to make in the interests of equality for all people in our community.“However, we would ask folk travelling on the ferries to keep themselves and our crews safe by following current health and hygiene advice — in just the same way as they have been over many weeks and months. It is also important that folk continue to watch for any further announcements by the Scottish Government.”The news was welcomed by Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur.Constituents had contacted Mr McArthur, concerned at the plans to restrict travel, leading to discussions with Orkney Ferries, OIC and Scottish Ministers.A pleased Mr McArthur said the additional flexibility would come as a great relief to many isles residents and their families.“While additional care certainly needs to be taken, and travel and gatherings should be avoided wherever possible, it’s right that people in Orkney are able to travel within their local authority area in the same way as people in every other part of the country,# said Mr McArthur.“I have been contacted by many constituents over the past  hours, surprised and concerned at the prospect of more robust restrictions being put in place for those living in the isles.

Orkney is an exception to this, and will instead be placed in Level Three.She advised that school holidays across Scotland will be extended to January , after which pupils will resume learning online. It is hope that pupils may be able toto schools physically by January .Ahead of announcing the news that Scotland would be enhancing restrictions nationwide, come Boxing Day, the First Minister said that, while she understood why some areas with a relatively low number of cases may be disappointed by this news, she would direct them to figures showing the rapid increase in cases in the south east of England in just the past few days.#My judgement is,we do nothing or do to little now, then things will get much than they need to be,# Ms Sturgeon said:She added: #I know how harsh this sounds.

Orkney continues to be in the unique position of having very few cases of Covid-, with no new cases reported for a considerable number of weeks.“It is our argument that nurseries and schools should be open as normal and remain so for as long as this remains safe # for the sake of academic progression, for the health and wellbeing of our young people, and for the economic prosperity of our community.“Too many of our vulnerable children and young people continue to be seriously disadvantaged because poor or no connectivity in many parts of Orkney means they do not have access to the internet therefore to remote learning. It means they continue to miss out on so much, which is extremely unfair. Without a fullto school early in January, many working parents will also be disadvantaged by having to provide unplanned childcare.“If we receive special permission from the Scottish Government to fully re-open as originally planned, we will noty families, carers and staff as soon as possible in January with updated information about this. Talks with the Government will resume on Monday January .”Current timetable for schools opening in January The Scottish Government has granted the council an exceptional closure day on Wednesday  January. All schools and nurseries will be closed to allow staff to plan and prepare for the unique arrangements they need to have in place.School transport and the School Meals Service will operate as normal from Thursday  January.From the  January, the children of key workers and vulnerable children should attend school or nursery for face-to-face learning. All other children and young people will be provided with remote learning at home.It is hoped that from Monday  January, nurseries and schools will be open as usual for all children and young people.Halls residents eligible for childcare during the period  to  January should attend their island school.Whilst correct at the time this update was issued, the information provided is subject to change. Please keep an eye on government announcements, the OIC Updates Facebook page and the council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukIn the case of children considered to be vulnerable, there will be no requirement for parents or carers to apply for a place at school or nursery from January . Schools will contact families direct on January  to discuss arrangements. The Scottish Government has instructed local authorities to broaden the definition of vulnerability to ensure that children experiencing any signicant disadvantage which may impact negatively on future attainment are included in this group.If you are a key worker, as defined by the categories below, did not previously apply for childcare but now require it, please complete the application form www.smartsurvey s OIC-Childcare  as soon as possible.Category  – All workerswithout whom there could be a signicant impact on Scotland.Please note that you should not expect to hear whether your child has a place until Wednesday January .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s great as it doesn’t dominate the taste but just melts into and improves the flavour of all types of dishes, and you only need to use a small amount.” Indeed, feedback from a repeat customer confirms this: “I love cooking with your salt and think about its purity and provenance every time.” Meena added, “These kind of comments bring joy to our hearts!”Fellow director, Chris Watts adds, “We have always looked at the business in a holistic way, with eco-credentials at the heart of the business, from production to the packaging design to the end product. We are very proud to be part of the Scottish Food and Drink Industry, which we know will continue to thrive.”Asked how Isle of Skye Sea Salt had been affected by the Covid- pandemic, Meena replied, “Like most businesses, we’ve had a challenging year. Initially, we had to adjust and focus on our producer partners and increasing online custom until our catering and retail customers were also able to re-open in the latter half of the season. The eco-credentials, provenance, texture and taste have all made a dference to repeat orders. Every order matters to us. We are keen to promote the Isle of Skye brand. We would like to say a really big thank you to all our supporters chefs, collaborators, online and local buyers. Our hearts go out to businesses that have put in as much effort as us but perhaps haven’t survived. Hearing about the vaccine, we feel there is light at the end of the tunnel.

However, due to the global pandemic caused by Covid- this has been an even tougher year for them.”Alan said his family sees first-hand the support and specialist care that this charity provides by “how they support and care for my grandson.”“We were so grateful of all that the NI Children’s Hospice does that we as a company decided to advertise the charity on some of our vehicles,” he said.“ It is hoped that as our vehicles drive all over the UK and Ireland that this would further raise the charity’s profile by advertising the NI Children’s Hospice service and help with future donations.”Alan concluded - “I personally believe the work they do is invaluable to families and hope that by advertising their service it will lead to many more donations.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3557598.jpg--.jpg?1608802489000\n","title":"castle tower school receives 200 donation from christian publishing house","story":"PUPILS from Castle Tower School in Ballymena received an early Christmas present in the form of a donation of pound from local Christian publishing house, Timeless Publications.The money was generated from the proceeds of a Coffee Morning and Book Launch earlier this year when authors, Alistair Bates, Shirley Ballentine and Joe Boyd launched their latest manuscripts.At least % of the proceeds from the sale of every book published by Timeless is given to charity and Joe, who has Cerebral Palsy, requested that money from the sale of Trading Mindsets: God, Faith and Disability be awarded to Castle Tower.Joe said: I came through Beechgrove and then Fleming Fulton special schools as they were called back in the s so I understand how important schools like these are for the pupils and parents who benefit from them.I was especially delighted to be able to acknowledge Castle Tower as my nephew, Oscar is currently a pupil there. “It has been wonderful to see how Oscar has grown and developed, thanks in no small measure to the staff of his wonderful school.Alistair Bates added: Its a delight to be part of a team of dedicated local and international Christian authors who want to share their faith and glory God.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye Michael McHughDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFor most people Christmas morning involves relaxing in front of the tree, opening presents and enjoying a mince pie.But a group of intrepid swimmers opted to start the big day with a festive dip.It was C as they entered the sea for a bracing swim in Co Down yesterday.Festive jumpers were peeled off but reindeer and Santa hats remained on as members of a local club walked down the slipway and into the Irish Sea with barely a flinch.A pale winter sun and the whitewashed Donaghadee lighthouse provided the backdrop.Kathleen Monteverde said it was an exhilarating experience, adding: It is something I always admired other people doing and never thought I could do it.I started in February and aiming to go the whole year for the first time.She began sea swimming using a wet suit and that morphed into skin swimming.It definitely wakes you up and gets you ready for the day because Christmas can be very stressful - it is so busy, she added.It is great, you just get grounded and ready for the day.She said it was also a mindful experience: You feel the cold going up every part of you and you just enjoy it.It is really stimulating but it is about the company as well and having new friends.Numbers had been expected to be limited this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing infection rates and pressure on health services.But even with a strict lockdown looming, there was still a cheery atmosphere at the harbour, with one woman dancing in the waves.Jill McClements said her mother was  and had been swimming for  years in Newcastle, Co Down, extolling the benefits in friendship and how good it left her feeling.She added: This is the first year I am swimming through the winter and I think she is really delighted.In fact, I think I am the favourite daughter at the moment.At Portrush, meanwhile, thrill-seekers headed to the beach for a spot of surfing, riding the waves as they came crashing in to the shore.People also hit the seaside in other parts of the UK.At Portobello Beach in Edinburgh, hardy swimmers, some wearing antlers and Santa hats, were seen dashing into the water to splash around despite air temperatures being °C. Even a dog joined in with the fun after chasing its owner into the water.The chilly temperatures followed early morning snowfall in parts of the UK, with the Met Office declaring it a White Christmas. Reports of snow had come in from Leconfield in Humberside and Wattisham in Suffolk as of am on Christmas morning. But the arrival of Storm Bella today will bring downpours and winds of up to -mph in exposed coastal locations.

And the leading lady was also among a host of local stars who brought some festive magic to the streets of Londonderry.It was literally a case of she’s behind you as north west based theatre company Blue Eagle Productions staged a quick-fire version of the fairytale classic in a number of local housing estates.With the well-known panto cast from the Millennium Forum away from their usual venue closed due to the COVID- restrictions, producer director Jonathan Burgess ensured the popular live show would still go on in a new outdoor format apty titled as ‘The Show In Your Street’.The fun and frolics of the traditional Christmas show were instead transported to local communities in the Waterside area of the city for six evenings of street entertainment.The unexpected treat featured the stars of previous local pantomimes with Cinderella played by Rachael O’Connor Andrew Porter as Buttons the Ugly Sisters Keith Lynch and James Lecky Conor O’Kane as Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother Orla Mullan.Thanks to Organisations Emergency Programme funding from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the performances lted spirits and provided some light relief for adults and children alike who are missing out on all the festive shows which usually take place in schools, theatres and community centres during the Christmas and new year period.Blue Eagle Productions producer director Jonathan Burgess was delighted at the response from the local communities where ‘The Show In Your Street’ brightened up a few otherwise uneventful winter evenings for many households as a result of the ongoing restrictions to reduce the transmission of COVID- within the community.Jonathan said: “With so many indoor theatre events cancelled, we wanted to bring some of the magic of a live show to actual audiences in a safe but amusing way. The idea was that we would take the show to the people, travelling around ious locations where they would be able to view it from their windows, gardens or front walls while still maintaining social distance from other households.”“We encouraged people to keep well apart from their neighbours to ensure the health and safety of the community was not compromised and the show could continue as planned. Everyone did exactly what was asked of them and this meant we were able to proceed in the spirit intended.”“By staging the -minute production multiple times over the six consecutive dates, we managed to strike the perfect balance of having an appreciative audience without crowding the area and therefore keeping everyone safe while entertained.”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news cb .ece AUTOCROP w eeeadccd.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"The Show in You Street presentation of Cinderella at Eskaheen View, Derry, by Blue Eagle Productions.

The piece, entitled New Dawn, Renewal, Abundance, was completed by local artist Sara Cunningham-Bell after Dungiven Regeneration Club received council funding for the project. Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council held a consultation with the group, whose members are drawn from dferent backgrounds within the community, to shape the project. “They asked what was signicant about the local area and we came up with artistic ideas,” said Denis McHenry, one of the groups members. “We made our submission and it was scored and then the artists came back with five or six dferent pieces and we were involved in picking one. googletag.cmd.push The hare represents the nearby mountains. “Its an Irish hare, a native species and its representing the Sperrins and then you have the river on the background. Its perfect for a town like Dungiven in a rural setting. “Its very unique as well. Sometimes art can be similar, but this is dferent. Its going to become a talking point.” The sculpture consists of a native Irish hare mounted on a stone podium, with a stainless steel feature behind the hare, and decorated with a number of mots that symbolise dferent aspects of the town. At its unveiling last Thursday, artist Sara Cunningham-Bell told the assembled members of the group it was important the piece was in tune with the character of the local area. googletag.cmd.push “I think for it to be signicant, it needs to listen to where its going and who is going to see it,” she said. “This river element, this stainless steel, is representing our three rivers, which are going around the town of Dungiven and is reflective of the water that reflects the colour around it. “Its reflective of us as we pass by. Its got three names on the front of it New Dawn, Renewal, Abundance. Theyre all positive, dynamic words that are pointing us in the direction of the hare. “This is actually a female hare and the hare is one of Irelands oldest mammals. It was here in the last Ice Age, , years ago, and it has learned to adapt and support its family through huge change.     “The families of Dungiven have also learned to adapt and change and support their families the same way. The hare is symbolic of that. “Weve got this road going past Dungiven, but that wont change how strong we are as a community. The hare is saying we are dynamic, strong, a solid community. The work reflects the artist: Sara Cunningham-Bell is behind the piece. “The community markings are there, etched onto the polished stainless steel. The stone at the bottom is representative of the hidden stones at the bottom of the river beds. “It symbolises something that has weathered over time, but its there, its solid, its strong.” In what has been a dficult year, the community in the town has pulled together and Dungiven Regeneration Club are hoping the sculpture can provide the town with a further lt. “People will be asking who was involved and what it is. There are people from all sorts of backgrounds here,” said Denis McHenry. “Its a good way to get the community together, and its a long time since Dungiven had something like this. Its good to see it.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Through World War , through The Troubles, through Derry City’s Irish League expulsion, greyhound racing has always survived from generation to generation and family to family. Ever since , greyhound racing has been a part of the Brandywell, and it became such a staple of local sport that it was even mentioned in Phil Coulter’s famous anthem – ‘The Town I Loved So Well’ – ‘While their men on the dole played a mothers role, fed the children and then trained the dogs.’ The sport is etched in the city’s history and today the Derry News looks back on the good old days with the men, women, boys and girls who played a part in the sport thriving on their doorsteps. googletag.cmd.push    Cormac McHugh from Stirling, Australia, retains a great fondness for the sport in Derry. “Derry Dog Track has been a massive part of the city for many decades now,” he said. “It has brought a great camaraderie amongst, men, women and children. I’ve had many great nights in Derry and started off some great greyhounds off in Derry. It is also home of the great FARLOE Line which is world-renowned.” Jeff De La Cruz, from Cardf, visited the Brandywell with his family to relive memories with his late father. “My late father enjoyed many a night at the Brandywell when he was serving in Derry in his National Service,” he said. We flew out in  and he loved going to the Brandywell again. He said it was lovely to see greyhound people from both sides of the community enjoying the racing, like it always was.” googletag.cmd.push Those are just a few of the tributes to a sport that remains important in the hearts and minds of countless families in the city and beyond.           --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Through World War , through The Troubles, through Derry City’s Irish League expulsion, greyhound racing has always survived from generation to generation and family to family. Ever since , greyhound racing has been a part of the Brandywell, and it became such a staple of local sport that it was even mentioned in Phil Coulter’s famous anthem – ‘The Town I Loved So Well’ – ‘While their men on the dole played a mothers role, fed the children and then trained the dogs.’ The sport is etched in the city’s history and today the Derry News looks back on the good old days with the men, women, boys and girls who played a part in the sport thriving on their doorsteps. googletag.cmd.push    Cormac McHugh from Stirling, Australia, retains a great fondness for the sport in Derry. “Derry Dog Track has been a massive part of the city for many decades now,” he said. “It has brought a great camaraderie amongst, men, women and children. I’ve had many great nights in Derry and started off some great greyhounds off in Derry. It is also home of the great FARLOE Line which is world-renowned.” Jeff De La Cruz, from Cardf, visited the Brandywell with his family to relive memories with his late father. “My late father enjoyed many a night at the Brandywell when he was serving in Derry in his National Service,” he said. We flew out in  and he loved going to the Brandywell again. He said it was lovely to see greyhound people from both sides of the community enjoying the racing, like it always was.” googletag.cmd.push Those are just a few of the tributes to a sport that remains important in the hearts and minds of countless families in the city and beyond.           --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dormans Bar, on Queen Street, Magherafelt, announced the move via a post on their Facebook page, where they gave details of measures they had taken in an attempt to comply with the regulations. It is with a heavy heart that we must inform you that we cannot cater for our loyal customers today, they said. With the help of our dedicated staff we put huge effort into accommodating our customers last night in a way where we were able to observe and respect the current restrictions. googletag.cmd.push We operated table service, ensuring every customer had a meal and were compliant with track and trace. The premises licensed capacity was reduced by % from pre COVID numbers as directed by our risk assessment. In spite of all of the above measures we have been informed by the PSNI that they did not agree. Online footage appeared to show queues forming outside the premises. Footage appearing to show long queues outside the premises circulated online last night, scenes the bar said were inveitable. We are aware of a video circulating of a queue outside our premises last night in the public carpark. It was somewhat inevitable and we did our best to work with PSNI to control the situation, they said. googletag.cmd.push We had the appropriate signage in place for social distancing and we had extra security staff in place constantly monitoring the queue to highlight the importance of following the guidelines. We are heartbroken and truly feel like the hospitality sector is being discriminated against as we have all seen the queues outside the likes of Tesco and Primark stores as-well as many other business’ as the Christmas rush ensues. The bar has apologised to customers disappointed by the move and said they are currently working with the authorities in an effort to reopen. We are sorry to disappoint our customers today and we would also like to apologise to the small local business’, not least the take aways and taxi drivers who are also going to be adversely affected as a result.     We will close for today and attempt to work with the authorities to agree a way forward. To all our customers who have booked in with us for today we cannot apologise enough. We hope we will be able to welcome you back from tomorrow onwards. Police confirmed a COV prohibition notice had been served to premises in Magherafelt on Saturday night. A spokesperson said: On Saturday,  December police received a number of reports in relation to alleged breaches of Covid  regulations at licensed premises in the Magherafelt area. Police attended and engaged with the management and the premises were closed. A number of persons who were present dispersed from the area. A Covid  prohibition notice has been served. Police will continue to work with the owners of the premises. District Commander,Superintendent Mike Baird, appealed to everyone to play their part in fighting Covid-. A key role for the Police Service of Northern Ireland is to support our public health colleagues and the NI Executive to ensure we all play our part in stopping the spread of the coronavirus and help save lives, he said. “The public will continue to see a visible policing presence, with our officers on the ground across the District. “This is the most serious public health emergency in  years and we would appeal to everyone to continue to play their part in slowing the spread of this deadly virus and helping everyone stay safe and save lives.” Up to December ,  COV prohibition notices had been issued in Mid Ulster, with  relating to commercial premises.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Testing centres across Northern Ireland, including one in Derry, will remain open throughout the festive season and people can book appointments as normal. Contact tracing will also continue to operate during the holiday period. Dr Brid Farrell,from the PHA said: “Both testing and contact tracing will be operational daily throughout the festive period so I would encourage the public to engage with these servicesrequired, no matter what day it is. “The PHA also operates   public health management advice to a range of professional organisations for all reported infectious diseases, including those that occur in a school setting. This service will continue to operate throughout the Christmas period. googletag.cmd.push “For all of us, it’s crucially important thatyou have symptoms, get tested. If you’re contacted by the contact tracing service, follow the advice, and isolateyou’ve tested positive or are a close contact of a positive case. “We all want to enjoy Christmas, but it’s important we enjoy it safely – we need to remember that COVID- remains a very real threat, and we all still have a responsibility to follow the public health measures, get testedwe’re symptomatic and follow the advice of the contact tracing service, eventhey call you on Christmas Day.” Health Minister Robin Swann welcomed the continued focus on testing and contact tracing over the Christmas period and appealed for anyone with symptoms of COVID- to book a test without delay. googletag.cmd.push The Minister said: “The progress made in vaccination for COVID- is welcome, and we look forward with hope to a signicant roll-out of the programme in , but we’re not out of the woods yet. “Until a signicant proportion of the population is vaccinated, the risk from COVID- infection is still very serious, particularly for the most vulnerable in our society, and unless we can greatly reduce the level of infection, our Health and Social Care services will continue to be under intolerable pressure. “Testing is an essential part of the fight against COVID-. If you have symptoms, which are a new continuous cough, or a high temperature, or a change in your sense of taste or smell, do not delay, get a test as soon as you can. It’s vitally important that when waiting for the appointment and when waiting for your test results, you and everyone in your household must self-isolate. You could have the virus and be passing it on to others.”     Booking a test is straightforward – just visitwww.nhs.uk ask-for-a- coronavirus-test complete the online form, and you’ll be offered a test at your nearest fixed or mobile testing unit. If you have questions about a test youve booked or are having trouble booking a test, you can call . Dr Farrell continued: “I would also like to reassure the public that there is enough testing capacity in Northern Ireland for those who need it. We have four fixed drive-through test sites in Belfast, Derry Londonderry, Craigavon and Enniskillen. “There are also five fixed walk-through test sites, enabling those who do not drive with rapid access to testing on foot. “In addition, Mobile Test Units operate across Northern Ireland and are short-term testing sites that are mobilised in response to need and  or to provide additional testing capacity locally.” For full details on all of the test sites in Northern Ireland and more about booking a test, visitwww.pha.site cvtesting    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The park occupies a large area behind the Creggan and Rosemount areas of the city. It is home to two reservoirs which are used for a range of water-based activities. However, local councillors believe there is great potential for the further development of the park and they have asked council officers to prepare a report on what can be done. This follows recent discussions over flood risks which have been identied at the Creggan reservoirs. The Derry News recently uncovered information which identied the local reservoirs as ‘high risk’. googletag.cmd.push A flood inundation map shows that in the event of reservoir failure, areas as far away as the Strand Road and Buncrana Road would be impacted. At present it is known that the flood risk associated with the reservoirs will affect developments at Fort George, a community centre and social housing in the Glen area, the A Buncrana Road, possible Magee expansion and Ardnashee School. In addition, private development at the former Arntz Belting site falls within the flood inundation zone. As a result of the flooding issues raised at Creggan Country Park, the local council has proposed the setting up of a management partnership at Creggan reservoirs. googletag.cmd.push The council recently agreed to liaise with central government departments to prepare a ‘detailed business case’ to seek the necessary capital and revenue finances. The council said it will also continue dialogue with Creggan Country Park Enterprises Ltdand explore the possibility of the council with CCPEL, taking on the joint role of Reservoir Manager. The issues with Creggan Country Park were again discussed at the councils recent monthly meeting. Speaking at the meeting, People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said that while talks were underway about the future of the Creggan park, he believed it was an opportunity to do more to make the best of the great potential of the park.     He said there were a lot of areas of the park which were not currently being utilised. Cllr Harkin proposed that the council look at creating a masterplan to develop the country park to its full potential for the benefit and enjoyment of people living nearby and within the wider council area. The proposal was supported unanimously by other councillors.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After an incredible end to the  season, which saw him battling for race wins, Australian Ben Currie has re-signed for the team and will be looking to repeat that form when the  Championship gets underway at Oulton Park next May. Joining Currie will be Northern Irish rookie Eunan McGlinchey, who s to the Bennetts BSB paddock after a year competing in the World Supersport  Championship. Although it will be his first season in the Supersport class, the young rider is no stranger to Kawasaki, having won the  British Junior Supersport Championship before finishing fourth in the National Superstock  class in  on a ZX-R. googletag.cmd.push We were really pleased to be able to keep Ben onboard for another year. It was a challenging season with the bike in  and it was tough for Ben coming off the Superbike back to the Supersport class, but towards the end he started to gel with the bike and proved at the last round he is still a huge contender for the Championship, saidTeam Owner Michael De Bidaph. “Alongside him we have managed to sign the young and very talented rider Eunan, which were super excited about and cant wait to start working with him. We have a strong history with supporting young up and coming riders from Northern Ireland so we are pleased to continue that tradition and hopefully we can help springboard Eunan further in his career. googletag.cmd.push Ross Burridge, Head of Marketing  Racing Department at Kawasaki UK, added: “We have worked with both Ben and Eunan for a number of years within Team Green, so to have them both now forming our official Supersport team in the UK is a dream come true.” “The Gearlink Kawasaki team are synonymous with the Supersport class, and despite coming tantalisingly close on numerous occasions, have never managed to take the title in this class, so we are as desperate as they are to see that become a reality in . This year has been very tricky for everyone, so fingers crossed we can all arrive at round one in May with a full crowd and witness what is always some of the closest racing in the BSB series.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago. Her husband called around almost at once to see me, gave me this for you. How he knew yoursquod be here is beyond a mystery.rsquoUncle Will handed Jim a small box. He opened it. To his surprise it was a engagement ring, silver with a small amber jewel at its centre. Jim focused his eyes and read the inscription lsquoTo M.K, Saul .rsquo Uncle Will popped a bun into his mouth. lsquoYour young ladyrsquos called Mary Kane rsquo lsquoMaureenrsquos maiden name was Keenan, She married her husband back in, let me think...rsquo Jim closed the little box. lsquoAt Saul Church, Christmas ,rsquo he replied. His uncle was amazed. Jim had his ring.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever.

People wanted to show their support for frontline health staffThat is because a lot of bad things have happened.So, for the holiday season, here are some positive ways of looking at big events.. Covid- has lasted longer than most of us expected and there is now a worrying upswing in cases.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But perhaps it has been a dress rehearsal for a far worse future pandemic. The billionaire computer tycoon Bill Gates has been warning for years about pandemics. Now one has struck. It is unclear whether the death rate from Covid is %or closer to half that .% . That is a tragedy for those affected and in absolute terms a huge number of people .But some pandemics have had fatality rates of % of more.Most nations were woefully unprepared on everything from handwash to personal protection equipment to ventilators. We were ignorant of perils such as people breathing over others or shaking hands. Now every child old enough to remember things , say aged five or above, will know for the rest of their lives that some diseases can strike quickly, and spread easily.. We have been reminded of the fact that while people are selfish, we also act communally in a time of a crisis. During this pandemic, people wanted to protect the health service. The tendency to rush to GPs or AE over minor health matters evaporated. People also wanted to show support for frontline staff.Prior to this crisis western societies had become so comfortable and insulated from daily challenges that it would have been reasonable to wonderthis communal spirit still existed. We found that it does.Most people will observe restrictions for the greater good of society.. Covid has made society more aware of social evils such as mental health problems and loneliness. We have also become more mindful of the need for homes to have outside access. Fewer flats will be built without at least a balcony now, because fewer people will buy one.. Just when the world needed technology such as video calls, such advances became widely available.Ten years ago News Letter staff could not and would not have worked from home. Now we can write directly on to a page from home, and talk to colleagues by video conference, yet prior to Covid we rarely did. Many types of businesses are doing the same. Home working is not longer taboo, and seen as a bit lazy.There are pros and cons to both office working and home working. The latter can be lonely for people living alone or unbearable for people sharing a house with a noisy family. A mix of home and office working is probably the future. This will make le easier for people who still have to commute. Evenonly half of workers can work from home, andsuch people do so only on average % of the time, that will mean % fewer commuterson a typical day. It will make living in cities less necessary and should help rebalance house prices between town and country, and might help to rejuvenate a less urban society such as Northern Ireland. . Technology will help alleviate the problems above, such as loneliness. My family’s Christmas plans were heavily curtailed due to new travel and Covid advice, but yesterday I talked to some people by Skype , including a friend who was alone. Such calls can rejuvenate us almost as much as meeting people does.. The environment is becoming a higher priority. This should make it harder to build houses where you please, and lead to growing pressure big polluting nations such as China.There will be innovations in everything from planes that emit less to biodegradable plastics. The vast, and growing, global population might yet live in a cleaner world.. Things are becoming safer.The  year trend towards fewer major wars might continue. Roads, which have also become safer in the last  years, will become more so, via ‘smart vehicles’ that spot dangers.. Brexit. Whether you are fan or a foe of it, most people will be relieved that the UK and EU have pulled back from the brink of no deal.Despite the NI protocol, a horror to unionists, and despite Boris Johnson’s Irish Sea border pledges having turned to dust, he uttered an uplting line on Christmas Eve: “Although we have left the EU, this country will remain culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically, geologically attached to Europe.”It reminded me of the earliest Belfast News Letters of the s: full of news from Ulster, from all Ireland, Scotland, London, America, and above all from Europe. Each edition is packed with despatches from Spain, France, Holland, Germany, Italy, Russia and Turkey.The world seemed full of optimism then, It is all the better now. It will probably be still better  years into the future.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: A sense of optimism after the darkest point of the year is past——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Primary schools in particular, there is no rationale to close them.\"We have to take in account the fact that evidence doesnrsquot show signicant harm we can reduce or avoid by closing them.\"What we do know is that it causes real harm to children and their prospects.\"It is also the direct impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children by closing schools.\"While first minister Mark Drakeford said: ldquoIf I thought that those young people would genuinely be at home, genuinely self-isolating, genuinely creating that period before Christmas to keep them safe, Id be attracted to the idea.\"Im afraid the risks are that that simply wouldnt happen, that those children would be doing riskier things than they would in school. Better for them to be in school.\"But there was pressure from teaching unions for a sht in position.The National Association of Headteachers Cymruwrote to the minister for education, Kirsty Williams, to call for the closure of schools ahead of the Christmas holiday.They said: ldquoParents will undoubtedly vote with their feet and children will be kept at home.\"That choice will not be afforded to school staffschool leaders are not supported in closing school sites.\"No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with local authorities making their own decisions based on local circumstances. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We usually have between  and  cars coming through on a normal Saturday, that, coupled with the raffle I’m hoping to raise pound for Diabetes UK NI.Charities really need our support right now and I know any money raised will be put to good use to support people locally living with diabetes.Those taking part in the raffle will get a chance to win a set of new alloy wheels, a set of new coilovers and a car care hamper.Tina McCrossan, national director of Diabetes UK NI, praised Matthew ahead of his fundraiser.She said: This is Matthew’s third time raising money for us and we appreciate all his fundraising efforts, especially as it can be dficult to organise an event under the current circumstances. He knows only too well the toll that living with diabetes can take on a person. Without fundraisers, such as Matthew, we wouldn’t be able to help support local people living with diabetes and fight for better services for them. Thank you to all involved.”Diabetes is a condition where there is too much glucose in the blood because the body cannot use it properly. If not managed well, both type  and type  diabetes can lead to devastating complications. With the right treatment, knowledge and support people living with diabetes can lead a long, full and healthy le.

The Minister said: “My main priority has always been to protect our children’s education, mental health and well-being. I believe that this can best be achieved through face-to-face learning and social engagement in schools. “I am mindful of the impact the pandemic is having on our children and young people, particularly those who are vulnerable and from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have a high number of vulnerable children in Northern Ireland, for many of these pupils school is a safe haven and closing schools will immediately deprive them of this safe space. “That is why I have decided that it is in the best interests of all pupils for schools to open in the first week of January so that their education is not disrupted any further. “I want to again thank school leaders, teachers and staff who have done tremendous work, under very dficult circumstances, to keep schools safe. “I know that they will continue to reinforce departmental guidance, including the appropriate wearing of masks within schools and on school transport. “For my part, I will consider what further steps can be taken to help and support schools and will continue to seek the views of principals, school staff and pupils on this issue. “Finally, I want to wish principals, school staff, pupils and everyone who works in education a happy Christmas. The New Year will bring challenges but by continuing to work together we can get through this.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fecbefad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbedeafa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1608539461488.jpg--christmas_bubbling_reduced_to_one_day.jpg?160853946100","title":"christmas bubbling reduced to one day ","story":"THE Executive has taken the decision to limit the arrangements for people to come together over Christmas. Christmas bubbling will now be reduced to one day only on a date between December  and  to ensure flexibility for those working on Christmas Day to choose an alternative day that suits best. At last nights extraordinary Executive meeting, Ministers discussed the progression of the pandemic and were updated by the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor on the emergence and rapid spread of a iant strain of the virus. A statement after the meeting readL The safest place for everyone to spend Christmas is in their own home and people are strongly advised to stay at home for Christmas. Those who feel they need to meet with their bubble should keep it as small as possible, as close to home as possible and keep the visit short. Follow public health advice rigorously. Keep your contacts to an absolute minimum keep your distance wear a face covering and wash your hands. The Executive is urging everyone to travel onlyit is absolutely necessary. Travel is not permitted in or out of Tier  areas in England. Restrictions apply in other tier areas. Everyone should comply with all travel restrictions in place for each region and check the guidance at both the point of departure and destination. The Executive also discussed the issue of restricting travel and Ministers agreed to consider this further when they next meet. In relation to schools, Health and Education officials continue to liaise closely to consider how schools can operate as safely as possible. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, the Executive will continue to keep all matters under review, the statement added.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fecbefad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbedeafa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1608569304946.jpg--swann__follow_the_three_wise_moves_this_christmas.jpg?160856930400","title":"swann follow the three wise moves this christmas ","story":",\"image\":,\"description\":\"HEALTH Minister Robin Swann has urged everyone across Northern Ireland to keep taking the simple steps that prevent the spread of COVID-.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

As Christmas Day approaches, public health advice has been summarised into “Three Wise Moves”. The Minister said: We must remain vigilant about the threat from COVID-. The virus does not take time off. By strictly following public health advice, we can help reduce the risk to ourselves and others. “The emergence of a new strain of the virus has underlined the need to keep up our guard at all times. We underestimate this virus at our peril.” The Three Wise Moves are: Remember the basics. Keep contacts to a minimum. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands, wear a face covering. We’ve heard this advice countless times this year. But it’s just as relevant and just as important as it ever was. This is how we protect ourselves every day. Be risk aware. Particular settings are known to help COVID- spread: crowded places, close-contact settings especially where people have close conversations, confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Remember over Christmas that social distancing can slip in familiar surroundings and familiar company. Watch out for old habits creeping back in. This cannot be a normal festive season. If in doubt, walk away. If any situation makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, remove yourself from it. Put safety first and err on the side of caution. That’s particularly important in the next few days ahead of the lockdown, when shops and hospitality will still be open. Just because we can do something, it doesn’t mean we have to. No set of regulations can cover every part of le or every activity. We all have to do our own risk assessments and make our own decisions on how best to keep each other safe.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fecbefad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbedeafa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
