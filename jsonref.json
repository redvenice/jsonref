[{"url":null,"title":"Are Englands coronavirus cases creeping up","story":"Share this article In this respect, it is essential that people try to adhere as much as practically possible to existing guidelines, namely, use of face masks, maintaining social distancing, and working from home wherever possible.\u0027The growth rate reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day and, as the number of infections decreases, it is a way of keeping track of the virus. If it is greater than zero, and therefore positive, then the disease will grow, and if the growth rate is less than zero, then the disease will shrink.  Meanwhile, an interactive map which highlights coronavirus deaths by postcode in England and Wales reveals people in the North West were dying from coronavirus at more than double the rate of those in London in June. The map, which uses Office for National Statistics data, shows that one in 20 fatalities in the capital last month were caused by Covid-19, down from a staggering one in two at the height of the crisis in April.But in the North West, where several Lancashire towns are being kept under review for potential local lockdowns amid rising cases, one in eight deaths were attributed to the virus in June, down from more than one in three at the peak. The death rates were nine Covid-19 fatalities per 100,000 people in the North West and 3.1 per 100,000 in London. Despite seemingly having shut out the virus, London has still suffered the highest Covid-19 death rate of any area in the UK due to how hard it was hit by the disease early on in the crisis. The capital recorded 141.8 Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people between March and June, which is significantly higher than the 88 deaths per 100,000 average seen across England and Wales. The North West has been the second worst-hit area in the UK, recording 108.9 deaths per capita, closely followed by the North East (104.9) and West Midlands (100.2).Nine of the 10 local areas with the highest virus death rates in the UK are London boroughs, with Brent suffering 216.6 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Newham (201.6) and Haringey (185.1).   Middlesbrough (178 deaths per 100,000), Hertsmere in Hertfordshire (166.7) and Salford, Manchester, (166.2) have suffered the three highest death rates outside of London as the epidemic continues to bombard the north.  But all corners of the country have seen a decline in death rates since May, with fatalities plummeting by four-fifths thanks to the strict lockdown that was enforced on March 24. The greatest decrease in deaths was observed in London, where the mortality rate fell by 96.7 per cent. A separate report has added further weight to a trend throughout the outbreak showing that death rates in poorer areas are significantly higher than in wealthy postcodes. In the poorest, there have been an average 139 fatalities per 100,000 people, up from 63 per 100,000 in the richest areas.

Now it has more than 3,000 active coronavirus cases and Melbourne is in lockdown. What went wrong?Less than a month ago, Australia was the envy of much of the world. With daily new coronavirus cases in the single digits, it was feted as part of a group of “first mover” nations - countries like Taiwan, Singapore and New Zealand that acted decisively to quash coronavirus.In mid-June, after three months of tight restrictions and differing levels of lockdown, life was not quite back to normal, but as politicians liked to stress, it was almost Covid-normal.Restaurants, gyms and beaches across the country opened again, and in the southern state of Victoria residents were awaiting the day when premier Daniel Andrews would say they could “get on the beers” and return to the pub.Travel was also back on the cards. There was talk of a bubble between Australia and New Zealand, and interstate border restrictions were on the verge of being eased.But then, as a sunny autumn rolled into winter, infections began slowly rising in Melbourne.Just weeks later, the country has more than 3,000 active cases and daily new case numbers that are almost as high as the UK - with less than a third of the population. Five million residents of Melbourne have been thrown into their second lockdown, with no real sense of when it might end. Face masks are mandatory. Police patrol the Victorian state border. And the death toll is climbing. So what went wrong?On 19 June, at a routine press conference, Victoria’s deputy chief medical officer Annaliese van Diemen announced that seven cases had been linked to security guards working at the Stamford Plaza hotel in Melbourne, where travellers were held under Australia’s mandatory 14-day quarantine rule for international arrivals. The group were believed to have breached social distancing rules while socialising.Andrews said the source of the transmission could have been as fleeting as sharing a cigarette lighter. He warned the country was facing a “wicked enemy”. Day by day the cases continued to rise, until there were dozens linked to two hotels.A judicial inquiry into the outbreak this week heard that many if not all of the thousands of new cases in June and July could be linked back to the quarantine hotel outbreaks.The inquiry will be focused on the state government’s decision to use private security contractors, who in turn used sub-contractors, some with reportedly as little as five minutes in training, while in other states, police were on guard.Initially, the authorities launched a testing blitz on hotspots and issued a stay-at-home order – later beefed up to a police-enforced lockdown - for 3,000 residents of nine Melbourne public housing towers.But the cases kept coming. On 7 July Victoria recorded 191 new coronavirus cases, enough to prompt Andrews to announce a city-wide lockdown for at least six weeks.“I know a lot of people aren’t scared because this feels like something happening to other people in other parts of the world,” Andrews said. “But you should be scared of this. I’m scared of this. We all should be.”Now, over two weeks since stage three lockdown commenced, there are 4,213 new cases of coronavirus reported in Victoria alone, with 30 deaths. A total of 201 patients are in hospital, with 41 in intensive care.Australia hit a new record of 484 cases in one day on Wednesday. Melbourne residents now must wear a mask when outside home, or face a $200 fine.On Friday, six more deaths were recorded, and 300 new cases. Andrews said the army would be deployed to knock on the doors of those positive cases who had not answered the phone to contact tracers.This week, Andrews revealed nine in 10 people who had symptoms before getting tested in Victoria did not isolate before their test, and more than half did not isolate while waiting for their results. Many of them continued to work because they needed the money. But Andrews said a debate on the insecure work for many of those affected could be had later.The return of Covid-19 has hit harder than the first wave. Michael, a healthcare worker in Brunswick in Melbourne’s inner north, said it felt like every minor decision in his life held great importance, and that was exhausting.“It’s like you never get a chance to really recharge your battery, there’s always something worrying on the news,” he said. “I hate it.”And the outbreak is spreading across the country. The state of New South Wales restricted entry for people from Victoria, dramatically closing the border between Australia’s two most populous states for the first time since the 1919 flu pandemic. But it wasn’t enough to stop an outbreak linked to the southern state spreading through a popular hotel on an arterial road, and resulting in dozens of new cases at locations across metropolitan Sydney and beyond.So far New South Wales has resisted returning to a harder lockdown, with case numbers much lower than Victoria, and more success in tracing cases to known outbreaks. On Thursday the government announced the nation’s biggest deficit since the second world war, reaching $86bn (£48bn) in the last financial year, and forecast to blow out to $184bn in 2020-21.The numbers of new cases in Victoria are stabilising, but victory is a long way away.Andrews warned: “We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that even with stability, that will mean some people die, that will mean that some people are gravely ill, and it will mean based on recent international evidence that some people will not shake this like a common cold, they will have lasting impacts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720257605dd919e70078b77c9fceaa39c2fd77a2/0_200_5993_3595/master/5993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a27cd18fc5ee2563b32ba542c66a1ce","title":"i cannot wait england gym goers and swimmers react to reopenings coronavirus","story":"After months of coronavirus hibernation, people can start to return to normalityThe closure of gyms and imposition of lockdown measures dictating that people could only exercise outside of their homes by jogging or cycling wreaked havoc with workout routines across England.But with the reopening of indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports halls on Saturday, following more than four months of hibernation, many people’s lives will be able to continue to edge back to normal.Mason will be eagerly heading back to his gym in Malvern as soon as possible after sorely missing being able to swim and use the squat rack.Perhaps even more so, he has missed socialising with fellow gym-goers, although he is also slightly apprehensive because of the absence of a proper coronavirus contact tracing system.Mason exercised in his local park most days after lockdown began but he found it increasingly difficult to motivate himself because “there is only so much variation you can achieve without equipment” and he did not want to “shell out” on sets of weights.“A pool adds so much variety to workouts,” he added. “Not just to the muscles exercised but to the entire experience of being in contact with the world.”Mackenzie is also excited to return to her gym at the earliest opportunity, after leading what she described as a rather sedentary existence in recent months despite taking up horseriding again.“Mental health has been one of the biggest casualties of this pandemic and I know that swimming, exercising on cardio machines and using free weights helps me to manage mine,” she said.“I can’t afford to buy the equipment and machines myself and I am recovering from an ankle injury, which means that I cannot currently run, and the gym and pool have been incredibly important for my physical rehab, too.”She has been assured by the efforts of her gym, which was used by a local food bank during its closure, to keep its members updated with developments.“Of course I’ve got concerns but everything I’ve heard from my gym shows they’re taking it very seriously and are putting all the guidelines into place to ensure we can return safely,” she said.“I cannot wait, it’s a little bit of normality, but if I go there and it doesn’t look great I might reconsider.”Bullock is planning to do cardiovascular exercise on Saturday, weights on Sunday and swimming on Monday, after pre-booking a maximum three sessions. But he is frustrated it has taken this long to sanction the reopening of the gyms.“While an obvious need existed to close gyms, pools and sports halls during the initial several weeks of the lockdown, it is absurd that they have remained closed for a period in excess of four months.”A keen cyclist, he has been riding up to 200 miles a week, along with hundreds of sit-ups, press-ups and star jumps at home to keep fit. But because of the measures taken by his gym, he will still have to do part of his routine at home.“We’re only going to be allowed to use the gym and pool for 45 minutes in total, which is more than a nuisance,” he said.“Its a very short time. But it’s better than nothing. Still, I’ll be speaking to people on Saturday and we’ll try to persuade them to let us use it for an hour and a half.”Some people, such as Burgess, remain anxious. “I have just cancelled my gym membership,” she said on Wednesday, after it became active again following the lockdown period when it was frozen.While her concerns have eased over the virus, which she found “very scary” at the beginning of the pandemic since her husband has an underlying heart condition, she believes that a return to the gym would currently be premature for her. Perhaps within a few months she may feel it is the right time, she said.“I was mainly using it for yoga and fitness classes but I just don’t feel ready to be in that sort of space with no windows or access to open air yet. It would just feel very claustrophobic and sterile.”Burgess has throughout lockdown continued with her own yoga practice of 40-minute sessions around five times a week either in her living room or her garden, plus an hour’s walk.“I’m probably as fit as I’ve ever been in my life,” she added. “But it is harder without a teacher there to observe and correct, and it’s just not the same without the social aspect – practising with others and chatting after class. It’s a pity not to be having that.”Robinson also cancelled his gym membership, at the beginning of lockdown, but does not intend to return at any stage after repurposing his bedroom into a personal workout space by erecting a calisthenics station.“I definitely won’t be going back,” he said. “I just don’t feel like the gym any more, I’ve been drawn to other stuff during lockdown. Plus, I turned my lockdown prison into a gym and a yoga studio.“Not having access to gym equipment and weights has forced me to do bodyweight workouts and I’ve become much stronger than I’ve ever been from lifting barbells.”Plus, he saves on the costs of the gym, after an initial outlay on equipment, which he said cost him the equivalent of three months of gym fees.“I’m just going to keep adding to what I’ve got here,” he said, conceding that he has fears over what the vibe might be like in his old gym.“I imagine it might be a bit weird and potentially hostile. People have different hygiene standards, some breathe more deeply and sweat more than others. I do miss the sauna though.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a97376a7e62cc6c99fe1ade68ac1ab6d2ad8a090/0_109_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a78713b64153b645c1bebbb4c29750ab","title":"labour hmrc investigate sports direct pay minium wage guardian investigation","story":"Move comes after  inquiry suggests firm may be paying below minimum wage Labour is to ask HMRC to investigate pay levels at Sports Direct, after expert analysis of a  undercover investigation suggested the company could be paying below the minimum wage.The move by Andy McDonald, the shadow secretary of state for employment rights, comes after the  returned to the company’s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, five years after a first undercover investigation exposed how workers at the site were being paid less than the national minimum wage.“Sadly, the underpayment of the minimum wage is a widespread problem. Almost 1 million people received less than the legal level at the beginning of the last financial year. The government must end its complacency on the issue and step up its enforcement of the national minimum wage to give workers the dignity and respect they deserve.”The latest minimum wage concerns at Sports Direct have emerged after the  exposed in 2015 how the retailer was breaching minimum wage law at its warehouse, which resulted in workers receiving about £1m in back pay and Ashley being hauled in front of a parliamentary select committee.On Thursday, the  published a report having placed an undercover reporter inside the same facility during two weeks in late June and early July.The reporter recorded how warehouse staff at the group, which has been rebranded as Frasers Group, were unable to leave the building during their 30-minute unpaid breaks – a practice some employment law experts say should count as paid working time and, if correct, would push Shirebrook’s, in effect, hourly wage rates below the legal minimum of £8.72 to about £8.20.The law says workers are entitled to spend rest breaks away from their workstation if they have one, and breaks do not generally count as working time and therefore do not have to be paid.However, legal experts say that is only the case if a worker is able to spend the break how he or she wishes.Zoe Lagadec, the principal at Mulberry’s employment law solicitors, told the : “If the workers are not able to use their unpaid rest break freely and for their own purposes, then this time should be deemed working time and should be paid. These workers cannot be said to have taken rest away from their place of work if they are prohibited from leaving the warehouse during their only break during the working day.“Given that the workers are paid only three pence above the national minimum wage, this unpaid period of working time would breach the NMW regulations as the rate would fall below it for the whole relevant period.”Frasers Group said its warehouse workers did not have to be paid for the breaks and that the business had “no rule preventing staff leaving the warehouse during a rest break”.’s undercover reporter asked three separate direct supervisors if he could leave the warehouse during his daily break. All three said this was impossible and that the break should be spent in a staff canteen or on the smoking terrace.An HMRC spokesperson said: “Paying the national minimum wage is not optional – it is the law. Failing to pay workers the correct NMW can result in significant fines, being publicly named, and for the most serious offences, criminal prosecution.“We will continue to target employers who flout the rules, ensuring workers receive the wages they are legally entitled to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aecd4271b2d9e281087cd36bf3780878feb727a1/0_0_5037_3023/master/5037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17a0476a4896f6d8259d635548ba5011","title":"public leisure centres england remain shut funds dry up covid lockdown finances","story":"Future of many council-owned sites hangs in balance as covid lockdown tips finances into redApproximately a third of England’s public leisure centres will remain closed on Saturday as a widespread picture of financial distress among community leisure operators overshadows the long-awaited reopening of gyms and indoor swimming pools.While privately owned chains such as PureGym, David Lloyd and Virgin Active are eager to proceed with opening plans, the charitable trusts behind the country’s 2,116 council-owned sites, are being circumspect as coronavirus restrictions tip their finances into the red.Jane Parish, the chief executive of Sencio, which runs three leisure centres and a golf course in Kent, said the future of its facilities was hanging in the balance after it ran out of cash during the quarantine period.“We’ve been losing £100,000 a week of income but have still been incurring costs maintaining our buildings,” she said. “We’ve got no reserves left whatsoever.”Parish said the need to limit visitor numbers meant Sencio would be making a loss when it opens its centres on 3 August.Sencio has 11,500 members but its gyms and pools are popular with over-70s, some of whom were reluctant to return yet. It will take until early 2021 for income to reach even two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels, she predicts and is applying for a £700,000 emergency loan to tide it over.“We applied for a business interruption loan with our bank but didn’t get it because they wanted security, which our council wouldn’t give us,” said Parish. “I employ 343 staff. That’s a lot of staff and livelihoods could be in jeopardy.”She said “we won’t survive” if the loan request was later declined.The UK has about 7,200 gyms and leisure centres, with approximately two-thirds run privately and the rest by councils or operators on their behalf.Before the pandemic 10.4 million people had memberships but some of the large chains have reported losing up to a fifth of their clientele as Britons reined in spending during lockdown.After a frustrating delay – gyms had hoped to reopen alongside England’s pubs and hotels – popular chains such as PureGym, David Lloyd and Virgin Active are champing at the bit despite the financial implications of half empty gyms, smaller exercise classes and expensive cleaning regimes. A date is yet to be set for gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools in Scotland and Wales to open, while facilities in Northern Ireland were allowed to open on 10 July.The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “Given the huge benefits exercise has for physical and mental health, I know people across the country can’t wait to get back to the gym.“But it’s vital that users feel safe. That’s why we have worked hard with the sector to make sure they have the guidance they need to put strict safety measures in place.”“Fitness is a successful growth business but this has been an enormous shock,” Earlam said. “We have survived four months of closure and we will be fine, providing people come back come back in normal numbers, even if it takes us a while to build back the volume we have lost.”The shift to working from home is also creating opportunities for the upmarket chain, with its spacious centres and free wifi. Several companies have inquired about corporate memberships whereby staff could base themselves at a David Lloyd club.However, there is a concern that nearly half of Britain’s public leisure centres will not be able to stay the course, meaning even those that open their doors in the coming days could be forced to close again.“We have acute cashflow issues and are totally and utterly dependent on support from a council facing its own challenges,” said Chris Rushton, the chief executive of Active Tameside, which runs eight leisure centres in Greater Manchester. “We will open on a vastly restricted capacity and lose money as the furlough scheme winds down.”Rushton added: “Swathes of our sector are at risk. Not everything will reopen, and not everything that opens will be the same as it was previously. We are a sector that is delivering untold health and social impact and that is what is in danger here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba558f9dbec4f414993610194da89378e456ca6/31_0_4260_2557/master/4260.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c6a4ff343eda59c7bd3977522a585e1e","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

What did they expect to happen?If only they had known. If only there had been some kind of clue. A recent precedent from which they might have learned a thing or two. A well-documented and much-traduced pandemic-unfriendly, massed gathering of jubilant football fans outside an Anfield-sized, Anfield-shaped football stadium called Anfield, for example. If only.Then maybe, just maybe, the decision-makers at Premier League HQ would have seen incontrovertible evidence that might have helped them to decide upon doing the decent thing. To realise that, in the interests of public health during a global pandemic, staging a trophy presentation inside an Anfield-sized, Anfield-shaped football stadium called Anfield may very well lead to identical scenes.Contrary to the hoary old saw about football without fans being nothing, we have learned in recent weeks that, while far from perfect, it is sometimes marginally better than no football at all. By contrast, trophy handovers without fans, specifically the kind conducted by a couple of men wearing surgical masks, really are nothing if not weird and fecklessly irresponsible on the part of those who gave the go-ahead for them to take place. At some point while looping his bit of PPE kit around his ears, did it not occur to the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, that what he was about to do alongside Kenny Dalglish was a terrible idea?He did not need the evidence of the ribald crowd scenes outside Anfield on the night Liverpool’s players won the league in absentia to know a fair old throng of locals would convene when their heroes turned up to collect the silverware. He had it anyway but chose to ignore it, while at Elland Road similar scenes of health-endangering public jubilation unfolded under the banner of the notoriously hapless blazers who run the Football League.In Leeds it was worse, the club everyone used to love to hate but now quite likes having parked a stationary open-top bus outside Elland Road, all the better for their triumphant players to commune with an alarming number of socially undistanced and overjoyed fans who had been repeatedly urged to stay away because – checks official club statement – it would “assist dispersal should a crowd congregate at Elland Road”. No, really. They wrote that.Both sets of fans deserve some sympathy. They have endured long and painful spells in their own particular purgatories and in the case of the former, who in all honesty can blame them for flying in the face of government guidelines and the law to celebrate yet again? These supporters have suffered a fabled 30-year title drought during which the only Premier League trophy they saw presented at Anfield was immediately whisked away on the Blackburn team bus. They are entitled and should be encouraged to enjoy the ceremony that officially marked its conclusion. It is their enablers who deserve our bah-humbuggish opprobrium.While those gathered outside Anfield were having an undeniably good time in the company of like-minded iniduals basking in their team being presented with the Premier League trophy, they would probably have had even more fun if they could have actually seen the moment Jordan Henderson hoisted it skywards in the flesh. Another good reason, perhaps, why the Premier League could have considered postponing their presentation until the occasion of the big knees-up Jürgen Klopp has assured Liverpool supporters they will all be able to enjoy together “when this bullshit virus is gone”.It is perhaps also worth noting Klopp’s mooted party would almost certainly take place a whole lot sooner rather than later if the brains trust at the Premier League and their Football League counterparts had resisted the urge to stage trophy presentations for the benefit of TV cameras that were always going to prompt the kind of illegal mass gatherings in which any bullshit virus worth its salt will inevitably thrive. We have not yet experienced a potentially devastating second wave of infections, but there is no guarantee they are not coming.

In terms of those all important optics, Wednesday night’s festivities in Liverpool and Leeds were anything but a good look for the administrators of the leagues both teams won.But what about the beaches? Eh? And the parks? Why do football and those who follow it invariably find themselves in the firing line when so many others are equally culpable of further endangering public health? They are fair questions and ones worth asking if you subscribe to the bizarre but apparently widely held notion that football fans only like football, beach-goers only like sun, sea and sand, and never the twain shall meet.Well, guess what? A lot of folk have a variety of different interests, including football and beach-going, so it is hardly a massive leap to suggest the intersection of the particular Venn diagram in which both sets feature is decidedly large. While those gathered outside Anfield and Elland Road are undeniably football fans, they are also people some of whom can’t be trusted and who wouldn’t be human if they didn’t feel the urge to celebrate the end of a difficult and emotionally draining job exceptionally well done by their respective teams.

The country has registered more than 360,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 41,000 fatalities. Its death toll recently passed those in Spain, France and Italy and it is fast approaching that of the United Kingdom.After a short, non-obligatory quarantine, Mexico has already started to reopen its economy even though cases are still accumulating and the death toll racing to new records.Public health experts say the strategy has left Mexico flying blind. Instead of testing, the country initially employed mathematical modeling, based on samples from 475 clinics around the country.López-Cervantes said that system did not provide information which was granular enough to make decisions at a local level. In May, the government announced an ambitious plan under which 324 “municipalities of hope” – which supposedly lacked coronavirus cases – would be allowed to reopen.But an analysis by the thinktank México ¿Cómo Vamos? found that two-thirds of the municipalities opened without performing a single test. Most of the municipalities subsequently suffered increased rates of infection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f90c28cfe48acf550056d4651c61983b813039/0_31_2754_1652/master/2754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0738f512e4f6b0fd341619e6218ca15e","title":"uk reputation after dfid merger in safe hands under raab says trevelyan","story":"Outgoing international development secretary says Britain’s ‘world superpower’ status will remain after merger with FCO, despite fierce criticismsBritain’s status as a world superpower in development is in “safe hands” under Dominic Raab, according to the international development secretary, as she prepares to leave her post.In an interview with the , Anne-Marie Trevelyan expressed sadness at leaving the Department for International Development (DfID), whose work is “truly impactful” and “doing good”, she said. But she said she has seen passion and enthusiasm in the foreign secretary towards helping developing countries become stronger.Raab will be in sole charge of the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) when DfID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office merge and Trevelyan leaves her cabinet post in September. Boris Johnson’s announcement last month of the merging of the Whitehall departments has been widely criticised, including by three former prime ministers who predicted it would mean “less respect for the UK overseas”.Trevelyan, speaking from the Isle of Wight on what is likely to be her last trip as development secretary, said: “It’s always sad. Being the secretary of state is an all-consuming role and especially in a department that is doing good. It doesn’t get more interesting, more challenging or more rewarding to be able to make change.”Citing the UK’s £1.65bn pledge to Gavi, the vaccine alliance, as an example of DfID’s influence, Trevelyan said she would be “very sad” to no longer be doing that type of work.“The convening power that I was able to draw on to ensure that this organisation has five years of funding to vaccinate and save the lives of millions of children … Those sorts of things … are truly impactful, so yes, I’ll be very sad not to be doing that,” she said.“Because that’s what it should be. It shouldn’t be the continuous drip of aid, without outcome. It should be helping them to no longer need us. To get it right, countries can just be partners through trade and culture, equal partners.”She was confident Raab would be a safe pair of hands.“I tease him I say I’ll sit on the back benches and quietly cheer him on. We are considered a world superpower in international development terms. It will rest with him.”Asked if she was disappointed not to be asked to head up the new department, Trevelyan said: “It’s the PM’s choice and I look forward to a few weeks off to catch up with some sleep.”Trevelyan said it had been tough to cut the aid budget by £2.9bn, but she had worked “line by line” to prioritise key areas, such as women and girls, education and projects to tackle the climate crisis.The development secretary was on the Isle of Wight this week to visit Micron Group, which is providing pesticide spraying equipment to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization to tackle the locust plague that is devastating thousands of hectares of crops across Africa and Asia. She announced £18m of new money in response to the crisis.Trevelyan said Micron Group was providing “exactly the spirt of technical engineering and support” needed to get ahead of the locust swarm.“But unless other countries also step up and act now, this crisis will spread and cause even more devastation,” she said.Trevelyan was accompanied on her visit by Bob Seely, MP for the Isle of Wight, whose plan to close DfID as part of a vision for a post-Brexit “global Britain” was backed by the prime minister last year.Seely, a Tory member of the foreign affairs select committee, said he believed critics of the merger would be “proved wrong and we will emerge from this with an enhanced overseas foreign policy with the aid element and how we support people in other parts of the world as a critical part of it”.His argument for a merged department was that Britain could do more good by integrating.Seely’s paper said the UK should be free to set its own aid spending, unconstrained by criteria set by external organisations, and that the department’s purpose should be expanded from poverty reduction to include “the nation’s overall strategic goals”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7271739f81ac95dbceb4ce743de875febab2/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e066539534c562929b4a93722df26833","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy. Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

I am not one of those who has been hankering for a return to pub life, visualising what that first sip of lager from a glass will be like, as if that is a completely unattainable aspiration at home.I am in favour, however, of being able to bring an evening to a close at a moment of your choosing, something that is not possible if you invite people to your house. I find myself wishing for some sort of social convention that allows the ringing of a bell or the blowing of a horn that signals an immediate end to the evening, with no explanation required. The reason could be absolutely anything: you’re feeling sleepy, a bit drunk, or one of the guests has said, “All lives matter.” I quite like the idea of doing it mid-sentence, or even ringing the bell in the first five minutes, just to save everyone a wasted evening.I was a bit wary about suggesting the pub to friends, as people have fallen into two groups, broadly speaking: the first are chomping at the bit, because civil liberties have been compromised by an illness that hasn’t affected anyone they know, and so possibly doesn’t exist and the second cannot believe that pubs have been reopened, and believe that anyone who goes is doing so because they wilfully want to bring down population numbers.I fall somewhere between the two camps. But I was still nervous about telling people I was planning to go, for fear of being accused of wanting their nan dead. Similarly, I was apprehensive about going to a pub full of hardcore virus deniers holding banners with slogans such as: “I have my Corona in a bottle.”I had to prebook, and we were limited to a maximum of six people, but it was a lot easier than I had been led to believe. I had heard stories of one-hour time limits, and having to inform the staff of what drinks you wanted before you arrived, and exactly how long you were going to take to finish them. The truth is, there is a complete lack of consistency around how strict pubs are being, which is probably bad news in terms of Covid-19 management – unless we somehow discover that the virus is more chilled in Crawley.Once we arrived at the pub, we were able to take in exactly how the lockdown has been affecting us all, in a way that a Zoom call can’t convey. It had been so long since I had seen the bottom halves of any of my friends. Some of them had rushed to get their hair cut the second hairdressers opened, and others had decided we have been shackled to the restrictions of regular haircuts for far too long and were moving into a new era of being more relaxed about their appearance. I, for one, am fully in favour of these kind of epiphanies, as long as I don’t have to hear about them.We sat outside and ordered at the door, after which the drinks were brought to us. We had to get used to the fact that every time one of us went to order a drink we were treated as if this was the first time it had ever happened but I think it’s pretty shitty to complain about the service of a place that is opening in such challenging times.All in all, a great evening was had by all, with the exception of a brief moment when one of my friends started talking about how making face masks compulsory was oppressive. If I’d had a bell, I would have rung it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995dfb0fc179ba7598841430dcb5d3440ff87922/0_203_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=73e663e19204bfb452d6a8d7988f6cad","title":"shine on from catwalks to tiktok lip gloss is back from the 90s","story":"Slick lips may be a novelty for Generation Z, but for those who remember the glosses of yesteryear, is anything different this time around?As a teenager in the 90s, lip gloss was boss.I was never without a couple of Lancôme Juicy Tubes rolling around in my high school backpack, I smeared on Clinique Chubby Sticks for that shiny je ne sais quoi before first dates and to this day the sweet vanilla scent of M.A.C. Lipglass takes me back to my Year 12 formal.As the early aughts rolled around, my love affair with lip gloss continued. From Paris and Britney to Lindsay, Nicole and Jessica, no celebrity worth their Motorola flip phone fronted the paparazzi without a slick of high-shine lip lacquer. As I scrolled their misdemeanours (oops! They did it again!) on the internet at home, I too was smearing my smackers with slick layers of gloop that smelled like bubble gum and had the consistency of margarine.But when my twenties came around, I kissed lip gloss goodbye. I moved on to lipstick, favouring the bold pigments, maturity and sophistication it conveyed, compared with the innocence of gloss. I was also sick of its fly-catching abilities and the cloying scent of watermelon.Too sticky, messy and tricky to reapply were some of the biggest problems us lip gloss addicts faced, making way for matte, long-lasting lipsticks. As my friend Rebecca said when I told her I was writing this story: “Lip gloss is fake news.”But it’s now making a shiny new comeback. Celebrities like Ariana Grande have slicked lips to rival Paris or Lindsey (Grande’s range for M.A.C Cosmetics includes a mauve lipglass), Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty lip gloss range sold out entirely eight times within three months of its initial release, and high-shine lips showed up on the runways of fashion brands including Balmain and Chanel at Paris Fashion Week in March.Beauty’s obsession with anything that evokes a healthy glow is also fuelling the trend. Full lips signal youth and vitality. And they’re just about the only part of you that’s visible while sheltering in place – whether you’re lip-synching from home on TikTok or video calling a Tinder date.But lip gloss is not just for those who don’t remember the 90s. “New and improved” formulas claim to do everything from hydrating and treating lips to plumping and protecting them, trying to lure in a generation who can still taste the watermelon from the first time around. In the spirit of becoming a #glossguineapig, I reverted to my teenage years and tried some.I started with the self-appointed queen of the lustrous new arrivals, the Wet Lip Oil Gloss by US clean beauty brand Kosas ($43, from Mecca) – star of 8,600 beauty YouTube videos and counting. It comes in five shades, from Malibu (almost Barbie pink in the tube, much more natural on the lips) to Fruit Juice (um, did somebody say watermelon?) and Jaws (vivid cherry) in a cool rectangular tube with a swimming pool-blue lid that has a little Bauhaus styling about it, if I’m not mistaken. The multi-tasking treatment promises to plump and hydrate while providing a sassy slick of colour.It is smooth as silk to dab on, with a pleasingly plump doe-foot applicator. I did find it needed to be reapplied after an hour or two – the consistency is quite thin – but the colour payoff is superb and it’s super comfortable to boot.The big news in the world of lip gloss (I know you’re on the edge of your seat) is the hybrid lip gloss-lipstick, as championed by Ilia (another clean beauty brand) and Jouer from Los Angeles. Both swatch on with a sheer wash of pigment that can be built up in intensity, and the Jouer Lip Enhancer Shine Balm ($29 from Mecca) has the added bonus of a subtle vanilla scent that recalls my M.A.C Lipglass days of yore. This time around, however, their silky textures prevent the whiplash I constantly suffered when my ruler-straight hair (thank you, 90s straightening irons!) got caught in the tacky, cement-like formulas I was constantly lavishing on my lips pre-internet.For truly eye-popping colours, the recently released Mecca Max Gloss Boss comes in 15 medium-coverage hues ranging from deep magenta to vivid coral at $18 a pop.With these watery formulas there’s still a hint of my adolescent memories – lip gloss dribbling down my chin like a melted Paddle Pop – but hey, nobody said looking good was easy.Go-To’s Pinky-Nudey Lips! ($17, exclamation point included) also has a good not-too-pink-not-too-almond colour. The tinted balm from the company founded by former beauty writer Zoe Foster Blake has an SPF of only 15, so it’s not really going to do the sun protection job for long, but its colour will complement just about any makeup look or skin tone.I would also recommend the rose and nude shades of Mecca Cosmetica’s Lip De-Luscious Glide ($30). With an SPF of 15 in a pleasingly minimal magnetised bullet, the two mega-glossy and hydrating formulas work well with daytime and evening makeup.The plethora of new formulas, colours and finishes mean there probably is a lip gloss out there to suit most tastes now – and with less of that margarine feeling. I may have traded my backpack for a handbag, but it looks like there’ll still be a few tubes of gloss rolling around in there.

The most enduring example is Jolene, where Dolly Parton pleads with an auburn-haired, green-eyed mistress not to toy with her lover any further. It’s a time-honoured tale that south London’s Raye name-checks, updates and shakes firmly by the gingham-clad shoulders on her new single, Natalie Don’t.Although pop has long prided itself on its willingness to uplift other women – see Destiny’s Child, Katy Perry in Firework-mode and Taylor Swift eagerly recruiting new members of her squad for proof – there is one notable exception when it comes to not criticising your sisters, and that’s when one of them is trying to steal your man.  In 2018, Stormzy donned his best fluffy pink Stetson to pick apart Jolene’s troubling narrative on Twitter, nailing the reasons why the 46-year-old song still resonates harder than a Dear Deidre letter: because, although we feel for Dolly, and we all know the real wrong’ un in this situation is the man, we also can’t quite shake the feeling we all know a Jolene. “Kinda sad actually, wish Dolly had more self-love and confidence or the strength to just leave my man cah it ain’t really Jolene’s fault,” wrote Stormzy, “but then again Jolene knows exactly what she’s doing the lil jezzy.”While Dolly’s desperate way of trying to bat off Jolene is by killing her with kindness and reminding her that she’s so fine she can have her pick of small mountain-town hunks, Raye takes a stauncher approach to getting shot of the other woman. “When you bend over like that  You know his eyes gon’ follow,” she sighs over moody Blade Runner synths, swapping Parton’s indelible sadness for a more straight-up “don’t be a dick, hun” attitude. “Natalie, please feel bad  Don’t text back, leave my man,” reasons Raye, not unreasonably.Natalie Don’t’s sassy roots can be found in Katy B and Jessie Ware’s 2012 2-step tale of cheating, Aaliyah, the two women trading bars that suggest that this boyfriend-stealer should watch her back: “With every move you make  You know you’ve got him transfixed  But you can’t get past me, Aaliyah.”But whether it’s Dolly, Raye, Katy B or Jessie Ware’s heartache we’re dealing with, there’s a simple solution to such flagrant adultery. Rather than hoping the third wheel will eventually roll out of the way, calmly follow the advice in Carrie Underwood’s acceptably aggy 2005 anthem Before He Cheats: dump him and then smash up his car. Easy.

Barnier claimed the UK was effectively excluding European fleets from key stocks of fish in a move that risked destroying the bloc’s fishing industry.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship.

Downing Street has so far appeared reluctant to respond to Barnier’s pressure, insisting its rulebook is wholly independent from the EU now the country has left the bloc.EU sources said there was concern in Brussels that interest in striking a deal was waning in London but that an agreement in September remained the most likely outcome given the economic damage of failure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517ba601fbd185e89a836425864983b26a0289e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5123e53c6b3194408405d797cdece4e","title":"public sector workers in england share your thoughts about the new pay rise","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, doctors and other public sector workers about their thoughts on the pay increaseAlmost 900,000 doctors, police, teachers and other public sector workers in England will receive above-inflation pay rises to reflect the “vital contribution” they make.Labour and trade unions welcomed the move, announced by the Treasury, but warned that the increases would not make up for lost incomes under the previous public sector pay freeze.

Dettori will set out against two opponents from Aidan O’Brien’s stable in Ireland trying to paint a picture that does his beloved partner justice.There will probably be tears to complement the usual flying dismount if Enable gets the job done and so becomes the first horse to win the King George three times. There are usually tears from her rider when Enable wins these days, perhaps because Dettori knows that every victory could be the last in their four hugely successful seasons together. And all through that time, a sense has grown that when Enable leaves the stage her rider may decide that the time is right to do the same.Before Enable came along, Dettori’s highest tally of Group One wins on an inidual horse was the five he registered on both Fantastic Light and Daylami, around the turn of the century and in the glory years of the Godolphin operation. Enable has already provided Dettori with as many successes at the highest level as the pair of them put together. Saturday’s King George would be an 11th Group One for what has been an unbroken partnership since Dettori took over for Enable’s third career start in the Cheshire Oaks in May 2017. That would also be one more Group One success than Tom Queally enjoyed in the same colours of Prince Khalid Abdullah aboard the incomparable Frankel.But if it arrives, it will have been quite a long time in coming, because Enable’s 10th Group One win was as long ago as August 2019, in the Yorkshire Oaks. An emotional Dettori said he was “crying with happiness” after an easy victory at 1-4 to mark what was expected to be Enable’s last appearance on a British racecourse.No one thought she would be lining up for an attempt to win a record third King George in 11 months’ time. Then again, no one thought they would be racing in front of empty grandstands, either.The unprecedented third win in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe which was expected to send Enable off into retirement at Prince Khalid’s stud slipped through their grasp, as Waldgeist ran her down at Longchamp. Her owner, to everyone’s delight but Dettori’s more than anyone, then decided to try to make it three out of four in Paris in October 2020. Enable then produced a slightly sub-par run behind Ghaiyyath in the Eclipse just under three weeks ago after nine months away from the track.But the track, trip and going are perfect on Saturday and Gosden is sure that Enable will be at, or close to, her peak. If she fails to justify a starting price of around 1-2 for the third race in a row, there are likely to be only two plausible reasons why. One is that, at six years of age, her brilliance is starting to wane. The other is pilot error, in what seems sure to be a game of four-dimensional chess from the first stride to the last.The first would be unpleasant enough for Dettori to contemplate. The second would be unthinkable for the finest big-race rider of the past 30 years. Anthony Van Dyck is a late non-runner, but O’Brien’s two remaining contenders are a complete contrast in running styles, with an out-and-out stayer in Sovereign and a speed horse in Japan. Dettori must find an ideal middle way to beat them both. If he can, the most successful and emotionally charged partnership of Dettori’s career will be refreshed before a return to Longchamp in October, when a crowd of at least 5,000 should be in attendance to feed Dettori’s sense of theatre and give the moment the intensity it will deserve. If he can’t, who knows?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a585f450dc899ba449d4981f82f891bcb1edf01/288_408_3346_2008/master/3346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c40bc9afe2e57925b4842d39cf57be7","title":"sebastian coe steve ovett rivalry forty years on moscow olympics interview","story":"Forty years on from a pair of middle-distance classics at the Moscow Olympics, Coe recalls complaining telegrams, Daley Thompson’s psychology and his opinion on the boycottPrecisely 40 years since the greatest two-act drama in British sporting history played out at the Moscow Olympics, Sebastian Coe still recalls every sensation in panoramic 4D: the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain. Especially the pain.“In the back of our minds we knew that in order to come home with at least something, we were probably going to have to demolish 10 years of hard, unremitting slog in each other’s lives,” Coe says, smiling, as his mind races back to a time of high intrigue, political boycotts and – of course – those two thunderous encounters over 800m and 1500m with his arch-rival Steve Ovett. “I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.”In truth there wasn’t much else for the country to be cheery about during the dank, drizzly summer of 1980. England’s football team had come home early from the European Championship. The cricket team were losing against West Indies, again. Unemployment was at a 44-year high of 1.9 million. But in Coe and Ovett, Britain undoubtedly had the two greatest middle-distance runners in the world. And after years of avoiding each other they were suddenly squaring off twice over six days. The stakes, as they both knew, couldn’t have been much higher.Long before Brexit, Coe and Ovett split the nation down the middle. You were either for one or the other: there was no middle ground, no compromise, no safe space. The 24-year-old Ovett, the son of a market trader, was seen as blue-collar and aloof, while the 23-year-old Coe, more middle-class and media-friendly. Both were hugely popular, though. Ovett had won the BBC’s Sport Personality of the Year award in 1978. Coe, having broken three world records in 41 days after graduating in 1979, snatched it off him a year later.In fact just about the only thing that everyone agreed on was that Coe, as the reigning world record holder, was the piping hot favourite over 800m – while Ovett, who had not lost over 1500m since 1977, was the man to beat over the longer distance. Only it didn’t turn out that way. Far from it.Coe had been imperious on the track over the previous two summers, but he was about to learn that chasing times was very different to hunting after Olympic gold medals. During the first lap of the 800m final he was repeatedly bumped and blocked, strong-armed and shunted back, an assault that began on the first bend when the East German Andreas Busse deliberately kept him out wide. With the race more like a game of dodgems, Coe was unable to rev up towards his top-end speed until Ovett had flown clear to take gold.However Coe was also the author of his own misfortune, repeatedly running down blind alleys and thus rendering impotent his talent. As Hugh McIlvanney sagely put it in the Observer: “Coe looked like a man who had been stabbed in the back, and then found that the knife was in his own hand.”Coe was so disgusted that when Ovett offered him his outstretched palm on the rostrum he reacted, in Clive James’s immortal words, “as if he’d just been handed a turd”. His father, coach and mentor, Peter was even blunter. At the post-race press conference he used the rudest four-letter word to describe his son’s run.“I think I lost that race before I stepped on the track,” says Coe. “It was just a suffusion of inexperience and just not controlling my own head in the 24 hours leading up to the race. I found myself in very alien territory. Normally the world can be crashing around my feet, as occasionally it does, and I still sleep. That was the first and only time that I’ve ever had a problem. Then at breakfast I was putting milk on my cornflakes when I dropped the jug. I felt very out of sync. Championships racing is just so totally different.”Coe now believes the East Germans deliberately used team tactics to try to stop him and Ovett. “But I don’t think in their team talk beforehand they figured out that Steve was going to muscle his way through,” he says with a laugh. “And good luck to him, he did. He wasn’t intimidated.”The following morning Coe was buried in bed, not wanting to lift his head from his sheets when the Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson marched into his room. “‘Come on, you’re getting up,’” Coe recalls him saying. “I said something lame like: ‘What’s the weather like out there?’ And as he ripped open the curtains he said: ‘It all looks a bit silver to me.’ It was the Daley school of psychotherapy.”Two things kept Coe going: the knowledge that he couldn’t surely run as badly again – and the fear that if he did, people would question his character. He also had help from unusual directions. Two days after what he considered his humiliation in the 800m, he was brooding in the Olympic village when his father brought in a telegram from England. It was signed by a Mrs Mullory, and said simply: “Get your bloody finger out, Coe, I’ve got money on you.” The Coes never found out who she was but they decided she was right.Meanwhile the Observer’s athletics correspondent Chris Brasher, a 3,000m steeplechase gold medallist at the 1956 Games, and the Australian Ron Clarke, who took 10,000m bronze at the 1964 Games, decided it would be good for the sport if Coe won the 1500m. So, they sent him a letter outlining the tactics that could help him to win gold. “Relax on the pace, move into position and strike – remembering that he who strikes first is generally the victor,” they told him. “The only person that can beat you is yourself.”It meant that when the bell tolled for Coe in the 1500m final he was ready. Having steadily wound up the pace after a dawdling first couple of laps, he struck for home as he entered the straight. Ovett, whose electric acceleration had been dulled by the sustained pressure of Coe’s speed, searched for fifth gear but found only third and had to settle for bronze behind the East German Jürgen Straub.Coe’s face – two parts exhilaration, one part sweet relief – made the front pages of papers across the globe, while Ovett was left shaking his head. But in hindsight, Coe wonders whether his old rival had subconsciously switched off after winning gold in the 800m.“In the call room before the 1500m I remember Steve saying: ‘Can you imagine what this would be worth in Atlantic City?’ and also telling me: ‘When this is all over it would be nice to sit down and have a drink.’ It wasn’t that I was particularly not up for that. I just couldn’t believe that anybody was at that moment talking to me. I just grunted and went back into my own little zone.”Afterwards Coe did not hit the bright lights of Moscow, preferring instead to have a quiet couple of drinks with teammates. “We had a guy called Boris who sat with us in the relaxation area,” says Coe. “He’d got a paperback covered in brown wrapping which he was reading while obviously listening to our conversations. I remember Brendan Foster asking him where the nearest nightclub was. He didn’t even take his eyes off the book. He just said: ‘Helsinki.’”Of course history could have turned out very differently if Britain had expected to join the Americans, Canadians and West Germans in boycotting the Games in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Coe, then a rising star in the Conservative party, was one of the more prominent voices calling for Britain to go to Moscow – something not everyone was happy about.“I actually ended up with a swastika being painted on the front door of the garage of my house in the middle of that debate,” says Coe, who has been the president of World Athletics since 2015. “But at the same time that we were being told that we shouldn’t go to the Games, pipe deals were being signed with BP and Russia, the Bolshoi ballet had arrived in London, and it just seemed a rather disproportionate response to target sport.”Incidentally, a few years ago Coe and Ovett, who sadly only raced seven times in 17 years, met over dinner and found they had a lot more in common than they had thought back in their heydays. Yet, inevitably, the same one-upmanship they had felt while chasing each other’s world records had not completely gone away.“We were chatting about the buildup to Moscow and in a rare moment of candour I told him that on a wintry Christmas Day of 1979 I’d done a run from the Peak District, 13 miles uphill into Sheffield,” says Coe. “I got back, had my Christmas lunch, sat down to watch the 800th screening of The Dam Busters and I remember feeling vaguely uneasy. I knew suddenly what it was. I sat there thinking: ‘I bet he’s out training again.’ So compulsively, I went upstairs, put my kit on, ran another five miles.”There is a Pinteresque pause. “When I told Steve that story he laughed,” adds Coe, with a twinkle in his eye. “And then he said: ‘Did you only go out twice that day?’ That was years afterwards, yet we were both still in the mindset where we couldn’t let it just rest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5abba159594cb1990a0e0558b1ca4d6e286d3f10/0_18_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5344b764e7b0a5e4e4181956f0505088","title":"sliding home baseball in colour in pictures","story":"As the 2020 season finally gets under way, we take a look back in time, courtesy of the work of artist Mark Truelove and his fantastic colorised vintage baseball photographs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ad2c360d4c3c1f9bb5024eca3a2d0e09d1fec6/75_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=458230545ccad223097f1f4907ae5fdc","title":"tiny dancers review national youth theatre isley lynn","story":"Available online Collaborating remotely during lockdown, National Youth Theatre players deliver an intriguing mix of sketches by Isley Lynn with restless verveIt’ll come as no surprise that Tiny Dancers, a collection of sketches devised during lockdown, is all about the struggle to connect. Written by Isley Lynn and performed by the National Youth Theatre’s Playing Up company, Tiny Dancers reveals a young generation isolated, frustrated and often just very, very sad. We watch two lovers share a dinner (and disastrous fight) over the internet a young woman talks to a long dead relative somehow contained in cyberspace, and an astronaut tries to make contact from out of space. This vibrant mix never merges into a satisfying whole but there’s an intensity of emotion in here, and a powerful desire simply to be heard, that’s undeniably potent.There’s a general air of restlessness and entrapment to many of the sketches but, while lockdown is mentioned explicitly a few times, the time zone of Tiny Dancers is all over the place. A few of the sketches have a futuristic sci-fi feel to them and are the least successful of the lot, often hinging on an element of surprise that winds up feeling laboured.The seemingly simple sketches are the most complex and powerful of the bunch. Kc Gardiner instantly captivates as a young woman, frozen with fear outside a party she cannot bring herself to join. In another scene, a young man (Mars Sams) calls his hospitalised brother (Jonathan Price) and tries desperately to console him. Milli Bhatia directs the sequence with visual flair: we initially see the brothers as two separate floating heads but, as the conversation continues, the two begin to mirror each other’s actions until they are almost, tantalising, touching each other across the ide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c15da4c12af6370237c55562eef03df37af3873/720_452_4009_2406/master/4009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7aa3f8205d3f25be39180cd9a558054","title":"garmin down how to get activities on strava ride swim walk","story":"Garmin servers are offline but you can still share your runs, rides, swims and walks with Strava.

The author and cultural commentator Roxane Gay described the decision as “weird, counterproductive and stupid. It diminishes the effort to actually end racism. It’s just so dumb.” The author Sathnam Sanghera echoed this sentiment, describing the “panic-erasing” of British television programmes such as The Mighty Boosh as “idiotic”, arguing that it would “make the deep concern behind BLM seem like political correctness”.However, despite the unpopularity of such removals among many people of colour, rather than, say, adding a content warning as has been done with Gone With the Wind, the idea of “ironic racism” was once again at the forefront of the cultural conversation. Actors and comedians performing racist tropes from a “liberal” perspective seemed more problematic than ever, and the idea that a creator cannot be racist if their work is made ironically, is naive at best and dangerous at worst. The comedian Gina Yashere recently posted a video on Instagram to denounce that particular defence, making clear that these racist depictions are taken as face-value racist entertainment by many: “What happens is these white actors and white creators bringing back blackface pretend it’s ironic: ‘Oh, it’s just characters, I just want to play characters.’ You’re making a fool of black people for your own audiences, because you know these shows are not made for us, they’re made for white people.”The stagecraft of ironic racism is one that invites a nominally well-educated and bourgeois audience to ridicule and belittle the apparently inherent racism of less well-educated, working-class and socially marginalised groups. This allows comedians and actors to “safely” perform absurd racist tropes through the malicious deception of an actually racist audience, therefore creating distance between artist and artwork. The logic follows that the scriptwriter, producer or actor cannot be a “racist” or participating in “racism” themselves if their work is being used to draw out the racism of a sub-class of citizens, an uneducated constituency who are the only people who could be truly capable of racism.In the US, the comics Tina Fey, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman have found themselves in the line of fire for performances which many believe perpetuate racism via “meta” disparagement. Episodes from Fey’s NBC comedy 30 Rock that featured four incidents of characters in blackface have been permanently pulled from circulation, inspiring broader scrutiny of her reliance on ironic racism. Her depiction of Asian characters in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Mean Girls was also criticised by the likes of Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos, who pointed out a recurring theme: “The underlying ‘joke’ is that they’re hypersexual and looking for green cardscan’t speak English.”Similarly, Little Britain was once again critiqued for its strains of classism, misogyny and homophobia as well as racism. Marjorie Dawes, the overbearing organiser of the Fat Fighters weight-loss class who repeatedly and intentionally misunderstands the accent of Indian character Meera, and ridicules other members of the group for their weight, is an example of at least two forms of prejudice. For many, it was now clear that the distance between Matt Lucas, who portrays Dawes, and his colleague David Walliams – both educated, middle class and white – was uncomfortably far from their creations. Often this was even presented as them “making light” of the out-of-touch, traditionalist pensioners such as Walliams’s character Maggie Blackmoor, who projectile vomits when she eats food made by a homosexual or ethnic minority, serving as a superficial pastiche of other quaint television icons such Keeping Up Appearances’ Hyacinth Bucket.But, for many, the joke never moved beyond replicating racism and homophobia. Clive Nwonka, a fellow in film studies at LSE, described this kind of comedy to me as “hyper-racial contrivance”. “Performers will defend their racist portrayals, or their mimicking and mockery of black and Asian iniduals by insisting that the characterisation is so hyper-contrived and unrealistic that the audience, which crucially is primarily white, will somehow recognise the absurdity and irony of the characterisation,” he says. The idea might be, therefore, for viewers to “confront their own prejudices and racialised thinking”, but the reality is that many will still take such portrayals at face value.Indeed, a sense of haughtiness from liberal audiences seems key to understanding why “ironic racism” has had the foothold it has in popular culture. In his 2006 piece The Heyday of Snobbery in The New York Times, columnist David Brooks writes of us entering “the era of mass condescension”, whereby “cultural entrepreneurs” have enabled us to “look down at our mental, social and spiritual inferiors”. His criticism of Sacha Baron Cohen’s 2006 comedy film Borat is particularly evergreen having described Baron Cohen’s franchise as often dependent on “an explosively funny rube-baiting session orchestrated by a hilarious bully”, 14 years later Baron Cohen still secures his cultural cachet through baiting and caricaturing what liberal, bourgeois audiences consider to be the unfashionable, stupid and obnoxious face of racism – all the while giving oxygen to abominable views.Last month, Baron Cohen “pranked” the far-right March for Our Rights 3 rally in Olympia, Washington, disguising himself as a country singer and encouraging the crowd to sing along enthusiastically to a bluegrass tune with obscene lyrics. These lyrics ranged from patent racism (“Obama, what we gonna do? Inject him with the Wuhan flu, “WHO, what we gonna do? Chop ’em up like the Saudis do”) to conspiracy theories about coronavirus being a “hoax” tied to 5G.As many have observed, the prank was a real-life pastiche of an outrageous segment from Baron Cohen’s own series Da Ali G Show, which, in 2004, featured the character Borat performing In My Country There is Problem, otherwise known as “Throw the Jew Down the Well”, with the stated aim being to expose the bigotry of the performers’ audience. As Baron Cohen is himself Jewish, one may be inclined to pardon this particular song as the self-parody minorities often make towards their own ethnic and cultural groups. However, this performance exists within the context of Borat being used in the presentation of Kazakhstan as exceptionally intolerant and “backwards”, and it is overwhelmingly this specific trope that the comedy is extracted from. His portrayal culminated in the government of Kazakhstan threatenening legal action against Baron Cohen after he hosted the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon in character.In 2020 – particularly considering the often obsequiously pious mode of liberal self-reflection and “anti-racism” in light of Black Lives Matter 2.0 – Baron Cohen’s stunts simply don’t land like they used to. It was foreseen: his unauthorised appearance as Ali G at the 2016 Oscars, apparently a physical commentary on the racial politics surrounding the awards show, which had reached a fever pitch with #OscarsSoWhite. As Emma Brockes commented, the trope is exhausted and simply serves to “gratify the comedian’s intellectual vanity” – although she observed that the stunt appeared to be better received in Britain than in the US. While 2016 seemed to be a turning point, criticisms of Ali G have been long-term and consistent, even if quietly marginalised in the 00s cultural renaissance of disparaging comedy. It is not true that everyone once found these performances funny, but they have simply now reached their expiration date. The black actor and comedian Curtis Walker described Ali G as “offensive” 20 years ago, saying that Baron Cohen is “dishing out all the cliches and stereotypical language. I find it quite degrading and sad that this is what catches people’s attention. I don’t like the concept of a white guy playing a black guy anyway, and when he is playing a stupid stereotype it is even worse.”Defenders of Ali G often falsely claim that the depiction does not amount to blackface because it does not feature the physical blackening of the skin. However, as Walker says, it is the embodiment of black stereotypes and the cliches of dress and language, from gangster chains to his misappropriation of Jamaican patois – “wagwaan” and “big up yaself” are regular catchphrases of the character.Although blackface has been a dominant, and for many inappropriate, talking point in recent months, there are many unresolved, and potentially more worrying, areas of racism that still exist on TV and in culture. Earlier this year, a new British sitcom, Kate \u0026amp Koji, debuted on ITV, which drew its comedic appeal from the interactions of a traditionalist white, working-class seaside cafe owner and an asylum-seeking doctor “from Africa” who speaks in a thick, non-specific accent. The sitcom has been previously described in the  as “a show so distasteful and dated that watching it is like looking into a time-capsule montage of Britain’s finest moments of racial prejudice”, while the Independent called it “agitprop”.Critical engagement with the racism underlying film and TV is a start, but scrutinising the liberal attitudes that allowed, and still allow, “ironic racism” to flourish is another challenge, as middle-class viewers continue to enjoy the entertainment created by a perceived distance between them and the “real racists”. But it is not the people they disparage who have presided over or are responsible for the entertainment that they are now having to publicly and embarrassingly backtrack on. As Nwonka says, the “racist character which exists outside of racism” is, at its heart, a flawed premise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43676c231f5643615c7f4d30bef5479d513a6b3e/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e841dcee616945f8b64a3ca4dd1da965","title":"us china mike pompeo america first","story":"Beijing is flexing its muscles on multiple fronts but Trump’s retreat from world leadership leaves it ill-placed to helm a fightbackThe confrontation between the US and China is gathering pace with each passing week. In the past few days, the Chinese consulate in Houston has been shuttered amid allegations it was a spy hub, and the US mission in the south-western city of Chengdu was closed in retaliation, on similar grounds.The FBI has started arresting Chinese researchers at US universities with suspected links to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), one of whom temporarily took refuge in the consulate in San Francisco, before surrendering.US academics and businessmen are being put under greater scrutiny for ties to Beijing and have been warned to come clean about them under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.The tougher legal moves have been accompanied by a concerted set of speeches assailing China by the Trump administration’s major national security and foreign policy officials, culminating in an address on Thursday by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, declaring: “The free world must triumph over this new tyranny.”Pompeo travelled to Yorba Linda, California, home of the Richard Nixon presidential library, to declare that the Republican president’s historic opening to China in 1972 had begun an exercise in failure in east-west detente.“The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,” Pompeo said. “The truth is that our policies – and those of other free nations – resurrected China’s failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that fed it.”Some of the grand geopolitical language can be put down to the importance of anti-China sentiment in Donald Trump’s bid to salvage his presidency in the November election. And some of it is inspired by Pompeo’s own efforts, increasingly at the expense of his day job, to position himself for a presidential run in 2024.But much of what Pompeo had to say will have global resonance thanks to Beijing’s rising aggression on multiple fronts around the globe. At the same time as rounding up more than a million Muslim Uighurs in internment camps, the regime has quashed the liberties enjoyed by Hong Kong, taken over disputed atolls, reefs and shoals in the South China Sea and turned them into concrete redoubts, and conducted a dangerous land grab on its border with India.Pompeo argued that combatting the grip of the Chinese Communist party “is the mission of our time”, a declaration likely to get heads nodding in large parts of Asia and the Pacific at least. But his claim, in his next breath, that “America is perfectly positioned to lead it” will ring hollow among many of Washington’s bewildered allies.In their eyes, China has expanded in a vacuum left by the US retreat under the Trump administration into “America First” jingoism and unilateralism.One of Trump’s first foreign policy moves was to pull the US out of negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership which was designed as an economic coalition to prevent China being able to dictate the terms of trade in the 21st century. US allies in the region went ahead anyway but it was severely weakened by the absence of the US administration, which sought instead to unpick existing trade arrangements with its partners.Similarly, the US effort to persuade China to join arms control negotiations would carry more weight on the world stage if the Trump administration had not walked out on three arms control agreements to date and is apparently in the process of jettisoning a fourth, the New Start agreement limiting US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons.The abrupt US departure from the World Health Organization in the midst of a pandemic, accompanied by a campaign of unsubstantiated allegations against its officials led by Pompeo, is also often cited by diplomats posted to Washington as an example of the US abdicating its global leadership role.The failure of governance evident in the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic – which has left the US as the biggest, most enduring hotspot, and Americans banned from travelling to much of the world – has also made it hard for US diplomats to cajole foreign governments into a common cause against China, without drawing pained smiles.The same could be said for the spectacle of unidentified and seemingly unaccountable paramilitary units making arrests in Portland. In terms of scale, it could not be more different from the mass incarceration of the Uighurs, but it is not a good look for a nation seeking to reclaim the mantle of leadership of the free world.It is a stroke of luck for US diplomacy that, at a time when it is at its weakest when trying to recruit allies, China is doing much of the job on its behalf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db97b0657e4169296fc834b13d821f3bdf3f469b/0_0_4823_2894/master/4823.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e32d4246fbbe4cd5cdf7ce17fd7c1d8d","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

It was the greatest dream of our youth,” Erdoğan said before the reopening. “It was the yearning of our people and it has been accomplished.”Outside, in Sultanahmet Square, about 350,000 people joined the president in worship. Many had arrived on buses from all over the country the night before, camping on the square overnight. Hundreds of excited people pushed past police crowd control lines on Friday morning, eager to be a part of the historic occasion.“I’m very very happy,” said Abdulazim Gassama, a theology student from Mali living in Turkey. “African Muslims know about the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople and Byzantium. This is important for Islam.”In neighbouring Greece, scenes of an opposite nature unfolded: bells tolled and flags flew at half-mast at hundreds of churches across the country in protest at the move, and Orthodox church leaders held vigils describing Friday as a “day of mourning”.The Unesco-listed Hagia Sophia (Divine Wisdom), known in Turkish as Ayasofya, was completed in AD537 by the Byzantine emperor Justinian. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in AD1453 Sultan Mehmet II converted it into an imperial mosque, adding four minarets around the building’s grand central dome.Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the secular founder of the Turkish Republic, turned the Hagia Sophia into a museum in 1934 in a symbolic break with the past, but Turkish Islamists and nationalists have campaigned for decades to restore its Muslim heritage.A Turkish court paved the way for the Hagia Sophia’s newest chapter after it ruled unanimously this month to annul Atatürk’s decision. Erdoğan. who has championed Islamic values during his 17 years in office, signed a presidential order turning the site back into a mosque almost immediately.The move appears to be designed to please his ruling Justice and Development party’s conservative voter base as the government struggles to shore up popular support amid a burgeoning economic crisis.Leading opposition figures have for the most part refused to engage in Turkey’s latest polarising political issue, either ignoring the Hagia Sophia decision or offering muted support.Internationally, however, the monument’s rebirth as a mosque has been greeted with dismay, drawing criticism from the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Pope Francis and several Orthodox church leaders around the world.The Hagia Sophia has also further strained relations between Ankara and Athens, which are at a low ebb over migrant flows and oil and gas drilling rights in the Mediterranean.“Today is a difficult day ... a shadow hangs over us with the transformation of Hagia Sophia into a mosque, something that genuinely shocks Christians all over the world and not only Greeks,” the Greek government spokesperson, Stelios Petsas, said in an interview with private channel Open TV.“We have warned for some time that this will create an unbridgeable gap between Turkey and the Christian world.”Erdoğan has brushed off the international criticism, claiming the Hagia Sophia’s future is an issue of national sovereignty – a favourite topic for the populist president.Osman Tarhan, a mechanic, was among the crowds singing and waving Turkish flags outside the 1,500-year-old building on Friday.“I see the condemnation from the Christian world as meaningless. Muslims prayed inside for five centuries, and there are a lot of churches converted from mosques in Spain. These things happen,” the 45-year-old said.“The story of the Hagia Sophia mosque didn’t end in the 1930s. That was only a break, and now it is a mosque again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0948a9770d92e4c44dca2cf2adeb3eaf00c755c/0_69_2065_1239/master/2065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2c3f9b2d55b52401b29190ff40e595","title":"hungarian journalists resign en masse after claims of political interference","story":"Firing of editor-in-chief at Hungary’s biggest independent news outlet sparks protestThe editorial board and dozens of journalists at Hungary’s biggest independent news outlet have resigned, two days after its editor-in-chief was fired amid claims of political interference.More than 70 of roughly 90 editorial staff at index.hu, including all the desk editors, walked out of the newsroom on Friday after submitting their resignations in the wake of Szabolcs Dull’s dismissal earlier this week.“A red line was crossed,” said deputy editor Veronika Munk, of the decision to resign.The departing journalists published an open letter on the outlet’s website in Hungarian and English. “The editorial board deemed that the conditions for independent operation are no longer in place and have initiated the termination of their employment,” it said.Munk, who has worked for the outlet for 18 years since joining as an intern while still a student, said many journalists were in tears as they left the newsroom for the last time on Friday.Index was considered the last major independent outlet in Hungary, which is ranked the second worst country in the EU for media freedom by Reporters Without Borders. During the past decade of rule by the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the media landscape has gradually contracted, as numerous outlets were bought out by pro-government figures or closed down.Speaking on a visit to Portugal on Friday, Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said claims that government interference was behind the turmoil at Index were “untrue accusations”, while the company’s chief executive László Bodolai has insisted that there is no external interference in the outlet’s editorial line.Munk said the editorial staff had asked Bodolai to reinstate Dull in a number of meetings in recent days. “He repeatedly said no. He said it’s a personal decision but I don’t think it’s the real reason,” she said.A pro-government businessman acquired a stake in Index’s holding company earlier this year, and a month ago the website sent out a warning to followers that its editorial independence was at risk. “Index is a mighty fortress that they want to blow up,” said Dull, in a farewell speech to the newsroom after his firing on Wednesday.Having taken the difficult decision to leave their jobs in a global economic downturn and in Hungary’s bleak environment for independent media, the former Index journalists are already thinking about how they could reconstitute the project.“We are starting to think about what can happen next. We don’t have a complete plan but we would like to stay together. We know it’s going to be really hard in this media environment in Hungary,” Munk said.The situation at Index comes in the same week that Orbán was able to water down plans by a number of EU countries to link the future disbursal of EU funds to rule of law conditions, and drew criticism from some European politicians.“I expressed big concerns about the situation in media in general in Hungary, and also specifically the situation in Index,” Věra Jourová, the vice president of the European Commission, said on Thursday.A protest march in support of media freedom was planned for Friday evening in Budapest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85534623deb5c9d8eb9c98a7a872b9ff028bef6d/0_0_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd554296e175f8845e2861854eba3890","title":"being heard how frontline health workers are recording history in real time","story":"History has shown that health workers’ stories are vitally important.

But all are expected to be supremely useful.Dr Dan Strachan, senior technical advisor at the Nossal Institute, says we’ve only recently understood the importance of consulting frontline health workers during crises – those who are not involved in policy making but who have a unique insight into what’s really happening in the thick of it.“In the past, the experiences and insights of health workers in epidemics have only been captured after the event,” he says. “But the recent Ebola outbreaks in Africa have showed us how testimony from health workers is key to shaping local response.”Public health experts analysing the Ebola outbreaks saw how ground staff understood the community’s healthcare needs within logistical, historical and social contexts. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, they could demystify why clinics full of foreigners in PPE suits were taking locals away to die.Dr Oliver Johnson, co-author of Getting to Zero: A Doctor and a Diplomat on the Ebola Frontline, says local health workers are the most important asset in the medical response to an infectious disease outbreak, whether that be Ebola or coronavirus.Epidemics are uncertain, he says, and there are huge variations between health facilities in terms of infrastructure, equipment and available staff, which can change daily.“The only way to maintain safety and good patient care is to continuously adapt guidelines to the context. Frontline health workers are the best people, in fact the only people, in a position to do this, so supporting and empowering them is vital.”If history has shown us the importance of listening to local health workers, modern technology allows us to effectively capture their stories.The worldwide rollout of the Health Worker Voices channel has begun in countries where English is widely spoken – with pick-up already in Australia, the UK, Canada and India. There are plans to extend to non-English speaking countries as the project gains traction.Data will be analysed by country, type of worker and theme of response, with key lessons collated and reported. Eventually, says Strachan, we will have an incredible trove of tales with immense historical value.“We’ve had a erse response. Some have put themselves in the shoes of people seeking care, others have talked about the logistical challenges such as the supply of PPE. Others have warned of the huge pressure emerging on the system.“We’ll be able to review the stories against the local pandemic trajectory and compare findings across different settings over time. The analytic opportunities are endless.”In the years to come, when researchers delve in and tease out the lessons, they’ll hear Nick*, a 40-year-old urban doctor, venting about meetings cancelled by social distancing measures.“It was hard for a lot of us … Things were changing so quickly. We all had to find our own sources of information,” he tells the channel.Occupational therapist Sally*, 34, struggled to connect to her patients by video. Some, she no longer saw at all.“One of the main concerns and challenges, I think for many in my situation, is what’s happening with those clients who are harder to reach,” she says.As coronavirus cases surge in Victoria, Melbourne-based emergency physician Dr Stephen Parnis believes the Health Worker Voices project “is incredibly timely”.“Every single person, with no exception, is affected by this pandemic and health workers are front and centre … One of the most important things to do here is share stories so that we can learn from each other,” he says.“Storytelling is the foundation upon which medicine is built.”Parnis, former vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, describes the channel as “a wonderful tool” for health workers.“It has the potential to empower and support a lot of people through this crisis and will enable us to learn during and after the event what we can do better.”Strachan hopes plenty more health workers will come forward to share their tales, from those in intensive care wards to community and aged care workers and those in disability services.“All stories are important – it is the perspective of the health worker about what is happening right now, next week, next month and later on that counts.”At its heart, Health Worker Voices also acts as an outlet. It ensures health workers, nearly drowned out by the chaos of pandemic, are being heard.The importance of this cannot be overstated, says Johnson.“If we fail to do this, if we leave staff feeling ignored and abandoned, then that’s a recipe for low morale and increased psychological trauma that will do real harm not only to them, but to patients and the response as a whole.”The voice of one 26-year-old mental health professional seems to perfectly encapsulate the uncertainty so many health workers are experiencing.“Yeah, just a prevailing mood of nerves and anxiety,” Richard* tells the channel. “One of the screens in the waiting room has been converted into a display that alternates between puppies and an aquarium and things like that …“Some of the staff were finding that they needed something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/422580cda5691a2ccad10f5eac0650476f4403f8/0_37_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c27ed3120a545a7054d0c0a7112ea1","title":"coronavirus live news us cases top 4m as who chief chides pompeo for untrue claims","story":"Biggest increases were from the US, Brazil, India and South Africa, according to the World Health OrganizationGood morning, Josh Taylor with you reporting from Melbourne for the coronavirus live blog for today. This is the latest on the situation in Australia.As Australia wakes on Saturday morning, the focus will again be on the southern state of Victoria, which now accounts for the majority of cases of coronavirus and Covid-19 deaths in Australia.On Friday Victoria reported 300 new cases of coronavirus, and seven deaths. There are warnings the number of deaths could increase substantially over the coming days. The number of new cases appears to be stabilising, but no one is taking it for granted, and the next few days will be crucial to see if Victoria has again flattened the curve.Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has warned those waiting for test results will be door-knocked by the Army if they fail to answer calls from health officials.In New South Wales, the outbreak seems to be getting under control, with less than 10 cases reported on Friday. NSW Health issued a warning late on Friday evening after a woman in her 40s tested positive after she had attended church services in Bankstown and Fairfield between 16 and 18 July.These are the locations, and they’ve warned people should isolate if they were there around the same time and have symptoms:Brazil has registered an additional 1,156 deaths over the last 24 hours and another 55,891 confirmed cases, the health ministry has said. The South American nation has now registered 85,238 deaths and 2,343,366 total confirmed cases.Footage of Niagara Falls tour boats highlights the stark differences in physical distancing between Canadian and US-managed companies.The Canadian tour company Hornblower Niagara Cruises’s ships can carry up to 700 people but Ontario’s strict rules have permitted them to carry only six passengers at a time.Here’s a summary of the latest developments:The mayor of Mexico City has warned of a possible resurgence of cases in the sprawling capital in the coming months, noting that hospitalisations have been on the rise in recent days.Reuters reports that Mexico City and its surrounding areas, home to more than 20 million people, have been the epicentre of the country’s epidemic after infections were first detected in late February. Cases began to level off in mid-June, but authorities now fear that downward trend could reverse.The mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said hospitalisations have increased in the last five days. At this rate, she cautioned, hospitalisation levels by October could exceed those registered in June, at the height of the pandemic. “It is important to recognise that, if we do not change the trend, there could be exponential growth” in cases, she said.Mexico City’s government began relaxing lockdown measures on 15 June, leading to the reopening of the dense and bustling historical centre, along with shopping centres and restaurants. In addition, thousands of factory workers have returned to their jobs.  Mexico reported 8,438 new cases on Thursday, its greatest single-day increase, bringing the total number of infections to 370,712. The country, which has the fourth highest death toll of any country, has registered 41,908 fatalities.Here are some more details on the latest WHO figures:The organisation reported 69,641 new cases in the United States, 67,860 in Brazil, 49,310 in India and 13,104 in South Africa. The largest increases in new deaths were 3,876 in Peru, 1,284 in Brazil, 1,074 in the United States, 790 in Mexico and 740 in India.  Peru recently reviewed its Covid-19 data and in one day increased its total death toll by 3,000 to a total of over 17,000 fatalities.On 17 July, India became the third country in the world to record more than 1 million cases, behind only the United States and Brazil. Epidemiologists say India is still likely months from hitting its peak.Cases in Brazil crossed the 2 million mark on 16 July, doubling in less than a month as the country adds nearly 40,000 new cases a day. A patchwork of state and city responses has held up poorly in Brazil, in the absence of a tightly coordinated policy from the federal government.The United States, which is the world’s worst-hit country with more than 4 million cases, has also tried to curb the outbreak at the state and local level, with only limited success.The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported the greatest single-day increase in global cases yet seen, with the total rising by 284,196 in 24 hours.The biggest increases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa, according to a daily report. Deaths rose by 9,753, the biggest one-day increase since a record high of 9,797 deaths on 30 April.Previously, the greatest increase recorded by the WHO was 259,848 on 18 July. Deaths have been averaging 5,000 a day in July, up from an average of 4,600 a day in June.The lockdown imposed upon Chile’s capital is to be gradually lifted from Tuesday 28 July, the country’s health minister Enrique Paris has announced.  He said people living in the less populous and wealthier eastern suburbs of the capital will be allowed to gather in small groups and leave their homes without the police permissions previously required during weekdays and outside night-time curfew hours.France’s health ministry has recorded 1,130 new cases in the past 24 hours signalling that the rate of infection is accelerating again after the government eased lockdown restrictions. It was the second consecutive day that the daily number of new cases exceeded 1,000.The ministry said the figures showed the need for people to show discipline by limiting unnecessary exposure and respecting hygiene rules.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday reported 4,024,492 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 72,219 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 1,113 to 143,868.The CDC reported its tally of cases of Covid-19 as of 4pm ET on 23 July versus its previous report a day earlier.The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by inidual statesHundreds of Nicaraguans are stuck in limbo between Costa Rica and Nicaragua after their homeland refused to allow them back without proof that they are not infected with the coronavirus, authorities said on Friday.Nicaraguans have been exiting Costa Rica since Wednesday through the border post of Penas Blancas but about 300 are now stranded, having been barred from entering Nicaragua by its government, Costa Rica’s immigration department said.Managua is demanding that the Nicaraguans, who are waiting for the impasse to end by the side of a road, show proof that they have taken a coronavirus test in the last 72 hours.“They are stranded at the Penas Blancas border post, on the Nicaraguan side,” Costa Rica’s Migration Directorate said in a statement.One Nicaraguan human rights organisation put the number of Nicaraguans caught between countries at about 500. Nicaragua’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Those trapped were not using an official agreement between Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica to repatriate Nicaraguan citizens through Costa Rica in isolation on buses, according to Raquel Vargas, Costa Rica’s migration chief.So far some 800 Nicaraguans have been repatriated this way in July.France is advising its citizens not to travel to the northeastern Spanish region of Catalonia in order to help contain the spread of Covid-19, Reuters reports.The country’s prime minister, Jean Castex said on Friday that the government would strengthen controls at France’s borders in the hope of better containing the pandemic, with people arriving from some countries being subject to compulsory testing.Nearly 8,000 cases have been diagnosed in Catalonia over the past 14 days – accounting for almost half of the 16,410 detected across Spain.Catalonia’s public health secretary, Josep Maria Argimon, said the situation in and around Barcelona was “at a critical moment” and called on people to heed the regional government’s request not to leave their homes unless strictly necessary.Meanwhile, Norway has said it will reimpose a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain from Saturday after a surge in coronavirus cases there.However, the government also said it would ease restrictions on people coming from more counties of Sweden, according to Reuters.Residents of the European Union, European Economic Area or Schengen countries with fewer than 20 confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last two weeks are able to enter Norway without being required to go into self-quarantine. A 103-year-old man has recovered from coronavirus in Pakistan to become one of the oldest survivors of the disease in the world, beating the odds in a country with a weak healthcare system, his relatives and doctors said.Aziz Abdul Alim, a resident of a village in the mountainous northern district of Chitral, was released last week from an emergency response centre after testing positive in early July.“We were worried for him given his age, but he wasn’t worried at all,” Alim’s son Sohail Ahmed told Reuters on the phone from his village, close to Pakistan’s border with China and Afghanistan.Ahmed quoted his father as saying that he had been through a lot in life and the coronavirus did not scare him. He did however, not like being in isolation.A carpenter until his 70s, Alim has outlived three wives and nine sons and daughters, said Ahmed, who is himself in his 50s.Alim also had to be provided with moral and psychological support during his isolation and treatment, Dr Sardar Nawaz, a senior medical officer at the Aga Khan Health Service emergency centre told Reuters on Friday.The makeshift centre was set up in a girls’ hostel just weeks before Alim was brought in and is the only one equipped to deal with Covid-19 patients for miles.Pakistan has registered more than 270,000 cases of the disease and 5,763 deaths. Though the number of people testing positive has dropped over the last month, government officials fear there could be another rise during the Muslim religious festival of Eid al-Adha, which falls on 1 August."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312836.1595611655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"school reopening plans to be unveiled on monday says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA plan to  reopen schools to all pupils on a full-time basis will be published next Monday. Photograph: iStockA comprehensive plan to fully reopen schools to all pupils on a full-time basis will be announced next Monday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed. \u0026nbspHe was speaking following a briefing from the Minister for Education, Norma Foley, and senior officials at the Department of Education on Friday morning.Mr Martin said a major financial package will be unveiled along with detailed guidance for schools to assist them with fully reopening in a “robust and resilient way”.“The objective is that schools reopen fully and keep everyone safe. The full plans will be outlined on Monday. They are by nature comprehensive. It’s a holistic plan, involving everyone in the school community, ranging from curriculum to teacher supply and supports, right across the board,” Mr Martin said.The Taoiseach said he wanted to give confidence and hope to parents that extensive planning had gone into the reopening plans.‘High-risk’Mr Martin confirmed that special measures will be in place for “high-risk” or immuno-compromised students and teachers who cannot return to the classroom.He declined to comment in more detail ahead of Monday’s announcement.Ms Foley added that her number one objective is the “full and safe” reopening of schools.In response to questions over the lack of clarity or detailed guidelines, Ms Foley insisted that “clarity takes time” and said her department was taking a team approach to reopening schools in consultation with the wider school community.She paid tribute to teachers, schools and students’ representatives whose contributions and observations have informed the plan.While physical distancing rules advise that one-metre distancing is required between pupils in most circumstances, Minister of State for Special Education Josepha Madigan said this should not form any obstacle to the full return of special schools or classes.“Our aim is to support all schools so that they can re-open in the autumn. This involves recognising the additional challenges faced by special schools and schools with special classes, in terms of cleaning, social distancing, and the health vulnerability of the students,” Ms Madigan said.Both ministers confirmed that the “July stimulus” package announced earlier this week includes €75 million in grant aid to fund school reconfiguration work to assist with reopening in August.These works may include reconfiguration of classroom space, adapting storage facilities, altering desk layouts, adapting toilet areas and other types of work. The grant will be paid directly to eligible schools during the month of August.The plans to be announced on Monday, meanwhile, are understood to include funds for additional substitution cover, structural alterations to classrooms and to improve bathrooms for hand-washing, along with daily cleaning and hygiene routines.AbsencesEnhanced supervision and substitution will be needed to cover an expected increase in absences of teachers and special needs assistants in light of official guidance that states teachers with any symptoms should stay away from the classroom.Detailed guidelines will be issued to schools next week with templates on safe classroom layouts and protocols for a Covid-19 outbreak.Large quantities of hand sanitiser and personal protective equipment are being contracted centrally and will be distributed to schools.Responding to the Taoiseach’s comments, Sinn Féin’s education spokesman Donnchadh O’Laoghaire said schools, teachers and parents are “still in the dark” over school reopening plans.“We need certainty and assurances that school will return at the end of August – dragging this out is causing real concern,” he said.Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin also criticised a lack of clarity to date which, he said, was feeding into anxiety on the part of parents and students."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Minister wants local authorities to re-orientate streets towards pedestrians, cyclists and public transportIreland is set to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps by 2030Gas could start to leak as oceans warm, a prospect researchers said was \u0026lsquoincredibly concerning\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to start"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe State’s political ethics watchdog has called for legislation to close a loophole that means potential misconduct of Oireachtas members cannot be investigated after they leave their roles. Currently the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) commission can investigate breaches of ethics rules by office holders, such as Ministers and Ministers of State, even after they have left their positions. Complaints about backbench TDs and Senators can be investigated by the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, or the Dáil Members’ Interests Committee, but not after they have left office. Sherry Perreault, head of ethics and lobbying regulation at Sipo, said this was a significant “lacuna” in the legislation. The commission’s annual report, published on Friday, called for this loophole to be addressed by the Government. “There have been a few instances where it has come up and the commission has been precluded from looking at it,” Ms Perreault said. Given powersShe said Sipo did not have a preference for whether it was the commission or the Oireachtas that was given powers to investigate former TDs and senators.The commission’s report said it had received several queries in 2019 about whether the conduct of a former Oireachtas member could be investigated. Last year former Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy was at the centre of a controversy over his non-attendance at Leinster House, while claiming a Dáil salary and expenses.He resigned his Dáil seat in December 2019 and took up a position with the European Commission in Brussels, having spent much of the previous two years working with the European People’s Party, to which Fine Gael is affiliated.Following the controversy both Sipo and the Dáil Members’ Interests Committee indicated they had no powers to investigate Mr Murphy, as he was no longer a TD. The commission’s annual report said it was “unsatisfactory that one category of public officials should not be accountable once they have left office, while others can still be called to account”.It called for legislation to address the “anomaly” and ensure all former public officials could be subject to inquiries over their past conduct, “notwithstanding their departure from their previous positions”.Ms Perreault said while she would not comment on inidual cases, the commission had seen a number of cases in recent years in which they had been powerless to open inquiries into former backbench members. Ms Perreault said an overhaul of existing ethics legislation was “long overdue and” and welcomed commitments by the Government to set up an electoral commission. The commission’s report also highlighted shortcomings with the current code of conduct for office holders. ‘Undesirable’Ministers were advised that holding paid company directorships while in office was “undesirable”, which the commission said was “insufficient”.”The rules should be strengthened to ensure office holders resign from any directorships “to avoid both real and perceived conflicts of interest with their duties”, it said. The report also noted some political parties operate in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, with different limits around political donations in the two jurisdictions. There was “nothing illegal” about the practice, but given the different ethics regimes it could have the effect of “benefiting or disadvantaging a party”, the report said.The commission recommended any electoral commission set up explore this matter further.

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area.

That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet.

It remained so until 1935.Then, the Ottoman Empire fell, and in its wake rose Mustafa Kemal Attaturk, with his vision for a secular Turkey. Attaturk designated the building a museum, open to all faiths an artefact of Turkey’s religious and cultural ersity.The religious struggle for Turkey’s most famous building was over, or so many thought.For 86 years, Hagia Sophia was the jewel in Turkey’s tourism industry and a Unesco World Heritage Site. Christians and Muslims from across the world could visit, though there was no organised worship.That status quo was upended earlier this month when President Erdogan decreed the building would once again open its doors for prayers as a mosque.Conservatives in the country had long pursued the change, it too played well with Mr Erdogan’s nationalist and religious base, but outside of Turkey, it has drawn fierce criticism.Christians across the world voiced their anger, and Pope Francis said he was “pained” by the decision, and was urged to intervene by Greece’s president.In a response criticised as flippant, Mr Erdogan invited him to the opening. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also urged the Turkish president not to go through with it, while others went further.Archbishop leronymous, the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, called it an “unholy act of defiling”, and held a day of mourning in churches across Greece on Friday. Cultural and antiquities experts also expressed dismay. Among them Unesco, the UN’s cultural agency, which said it “deeply regrets the decision” made “without prior discussion”.Ahead of the prayers, drapes were hung to hide ornate mosaics of the Virgin Mary and the archangel Gabriel, and dark green carpets personally chosen by Mr Erdogan were spread across the stone floor.Turkish wool was chosen over fire-retardant wool from New Zealand favoured by experts. Mr Erdogan’s decision has animated his political base.Thousands from the fiercely loyal Turkish diaspora in Europe booked flights home to attend, whilst an army of loyal analysts and political figures stood ready to shoot down any critics of the decision.The change at Hagia Sophia comes as Turkey also goes to war with social media companies.Mr Erdogan\u0027s government is going ahead with proposed measures to block social media sites if they fail to comply with strict new regulations, and a draft bill was approved by Turkey\u0027s justice commission on Friday.Critics of Mr Erdogan’s increasingly religious rule have described re-branding Hagia Sophia as yet another wound in secular Turkey Ataturk built almost a century ago, yet for others, the building is an expression of the Turkey of the 21st century.Some worshippers inside justified the change by pointing to Europe’s complicated history with Muslim places of worship.“Have you been to Spain? Have you seen the Mosques turned into Churches in Cordoba”, said Ozgur Gun, 40 who had travelled from Urfa, almost 1000 kilometres away on the border with Syria.“It was built as a place of worship. Christians are welcome to visit, of course, but they cannot pray here.“This is about what it means to be Turkish, and what it means to be a Muslim.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive calories pints bottles wine govts obesity strategy","story":"A crackdown on alcohol is at the heart of the Government’s obesity strategy, with plans for calorie labels on pints of beer and bottles of wine.Ministers hope to persuade overweight Britons to slim down by alerting them to the “hidden calories” in boozy lifestyles, with 10 per cent of calories now consumed in alcoholic drinks.Boris Johnson is set to announce a slew of measures aimed at slimming down Britain’s waistlines, after becoming convinced that his own excess weight was the reason he ended up fighting for his life from Covid-19. Britain is the second-fattest nation in Europe, behind only Malta, with more than a third of children overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, along with two in three adults. The new strategy aims to persuade Britons to make changes in their lifestyles, amid concern that daily habits have deteriorated during lockdown.One Government source said: “It is about looking at the hidden calories, and alerting people to things they might do unwittingly, such as drinking four or five pints, without realising that is more calories than they would consume in a meal.”Mr Johnson is understood to have become increasingly keen to take firm action on obesity, despite concern from retailers that the costs of some of the changes could cripple the hospitality industry when it is at its most fragile.In total, 28 per cent of adults in England are now obese, almost twice as many as in 1993.A report by Public Health England (PHE) on Friday revealed that men aged 40 who are obese, meaning a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more, can expect to cut their lives short by more than four years. Obese women of the same age will lose three and a half years. Men who are severely obese (a Body Mass Index of 40 or more) can expect to lose almost a decade, while women lose eight years.The research also shows that obesity increases the risk of dying from Covid-19 by 40 per cent, while a BMI of 40 or more increases the risk by 90 per cent. Researchers said excess fat can affect the respiratory system and is likely to affect inflammatory and immune function.  The research shows that just being overweight (a BMI of 25 or more) increases the risk of admission to intensive care with Covid-19 by 50 per cent, with the danger increasing as much as four-fold at a BMI of 40.Health campaigners welcomed the direction of the Government’s policies.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, called for changes to be introduced quickly, in a bid to tackle a growing crisis. He said:  “They will all be keenly fought by commercial interests, just as they have been for the last twenty years as obesity rates have been rising.”The food and drinks industry expressed deep concern. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK hospitality, said putting precise calorie counts on menus which change regularly would cost businesses around £40,000 each time they changed.She said: “At this point in time, imposing those mandatory costs on the industry will just cripple it while it is going through a very fragile recovery. Now is not the time to be imposing further regulatory and cost burdens.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive top private school had culture inflating predicted","story":"Governors at one of Britain’s top private schools were informed about “an issue” with predicted grades in 2018, The  can disclose, as a cache of documents lays bare the extent of its culture of predicted grade inflation.Sevenoaks School in Kent had a policy of increasing the predicted grades of its lowest-performing students in order to help them to secure offers from good universities, according to papers which date back nearly two years.The school – whose former students include the actor Daniel Day-Lewis and Lord Evans of Weardale, the former head of MI5 - also boosted the grade predictions of some better-performing students in order that they were eligible for courses that might have otherwise been out of reach.The practice could have given students at the £38,700-a-year boarding school an unfair advantage over university applicants from schools which took a more stringent approach to grade prediction.UCAS - the organisation which handles university applications in the UK - states on its website that predicted grades should not be “influenced by university of college entry requirements or behaviours”.The predicted grade inflation at Sevenoaks was even laid out in the teachers’ handbook and in the minutes of staff meetings.Documents seen by The  now show that the school governors were also informed about an “issue” with predicted grades at least 18 months ago, but that the practice remained enshrined in the teachers’ handbook until this year.“Predicted grades continue to be an issue – even being taken to governors”, minutes of a 2018 meeting of heads of department state.The papers also reveal that the prestigious boarding school only inflated grades for students applying to UK universities, and not those in America because “US universities do expect students to achieve their predicted grades”.For pupils applying for courses in the UK, the school told teachers that requests to increase the grades of low performing students are “usually accommodated” if doing so “opens up many more courses”.Staff were also advised that the school “may accommodate” requests to inflate the predicted grades of students who wanted “to apply to a course with the requirement above the prediction”, according to minutes of the 2018 meeting.On Friday night, the school refuted any suggestion that it unfairly exaggerates UCAS predictions, and said that it has made changes to its staff handbook following a review by the school governors, “so there can be no doubt that the School follows UCAS principles”.Most students accepted to universities based on inflated grade predictions would still be required to attain certain grades before entry.However, in some cases those pupils who fell short of the requirements could have a higher chance of being allowed onto the course anyway than if they had simply approached through clearing.Tom Richmond, founder of the education thinktank EDSK, said: It\u0027s all about opening doors...from a university perspective, with the student they are already in contact with through the normal application process, it is much easier to say, \u0027Well, you only missed it by one grade or two grades or three grades\u0027 instead of waiting for another wave of applications through the clearing process.Mary Curnock Cook, the former chief executive of UCAS, said it is “understandable” for schools to present their students in the most optimistic light, but that “it’s embarrassing for Sevenoaks that deliberately overpredicting students’ grades is in writing in their guidelines”.But whilst the culture of predicted grade inflation may have unfairly boosted the chances of many past Sevenoaks pupils – this year, the coronavirus pandemic meant that teachers were responsible for assessing students’ final grades for the first time.Sevenoaks uses the International Baccalaureate system rather than A-levels, and submitted a set of predicted grades to the International Baccalaureate Organisation in February – before the pandemic took hold.There is no suggestion that these predictions were inflated.In a carefully-worded letter to staff sent in April, shortly after the public exams were cancelled, the school warned teachers that they would have to be prepared to defend the gap between any predictions sent to UCAS and those sent to the exam board.“These differences are because it’s a different exercise and they are generated at a different time, but this process is not well understood and…you may be asked to explain the rationale.”The school has already been questioned over the practice of inflating predicted grades for university admissions by the Charity Commission.A Sevenoaks spokesperson said: “We are confident in the integrity of our processes and refute any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate UCAS or other predictions. We have been in contact with UCAS and are confident in that our processes are in line with their guidelines. All UCAS predicted grades are based on what is realistic and achievable for the pupils, in line with UCAS’s guidelines which make clear that predicted grades should be “aspirational but achievable””. There is no suggestion that Mr Day-Lewis or Lord Evans benefitted from having their predicted grades exaggerated.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gyms could struggle reopen fitness fanatics stick lockdown routines","story":"Gyms could struggle to reopen as fitness fanatics opt to stick to their lockdown routines, businesses said.Fitness centres can reopen from tomorrow, but Huw Edwards, chief executive of UKactive, the trade body, warned that financial pressures mean that could be difficult for some.Glen Hall, of Parkwood Leisure, which runs 80 local authority gyms said it was inevitable that some people will have started working out at home and that it could take a year or more for gym membership numbers to recover. He said Parkwood’s membership list has reduced by 21 per cent.Anthony Franklin, founder of gym-booking app Fibodo, said: “There is a risk that some gym-goers have now formed new exercise habits, and have started running, taking online fitness classes and booking PT sessions in the park, during lockdown meaning they are in no rush to return to the gym. “Their new work from home routine also means they no longer pass the gym on their commute to and from the workplace, with figures suggesting lots have since cancelled their memberships.”Mr Hall said that social distancing also made opening some gyms unviable. He added: “We have a gym that is a 25 station gym and with guidance that becomes eight stations. It is impossible to offer something that stacks up from a commercial perspective.”However, he added: “What we offer is more than just equipment. It’s also the sense of community and the opportunity to interact with someone else.”Research by UKactive showed that 87 per cent of gym members planned to return as soon as their centre reopened.Mr Edwards said that millions of people have been missing their local gyms but that some facilities would be unable to reopen because of the financial pressures of Covid-19.He added: “Physical activity has a central role to play in our nation’s recovery and our gyms and leisure facilities are needed more than ever to strengthen our resilience to Covid-19, as well as the underlying health conditions that have made this virus so deadly.”Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said in parliament earlier this week that he is working with the Culture Secretary to see what further support could be provided to privately run leisure centres.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lutons mayor broke lockdown rules towns coronavirus infections","story":"The mayor of Luton flouted lockdown rules shortly before the town was declared a coronavirus hotspot, the Daily  can disclose.Footage obtained by this newspaper shows Cllr Tahir Malik attending a packed garden party with at least twelve other men, in breach of social distancing rules.Luton Borough Council have launched an investigation into the actions of the mayor and two other senior Labour councillors pictured at the gathering on Tuesday evening.Two days later, Public Health England (PHE) upgraded Luton to an ‘area of intervention’ in response to a flare-up in Covid-19 cases. Health bosses are concerned about infection rates among the town’s large South Asian community, with people living on two terraced streets told to get tested.A series of photographs and videos shows Cllr Malik, who was appointed mayor of Luton in May last year, at the garden party.With a mask tucked under his chin, the mayor is seen laughing and eating with other prominent members of the community including two other Labour councillors, a doctor and a local imam. A video of the event posted on social media was captioned: “A wonderful evening with friends”.According to government rules updated in July, no more than six people or two households can gather outside. At least twelve men including Cllr Malik can be seen sitting closely together in the pictures.During the pandemic Cllr Malik has repeatedly urged Luton’s Muslim community to follow government guidelines “for their own and loved ones’ safety”, including staying at home during the Eid festival.In April he wrote an open letter praising volunteers and emergency services, adding: “Social distancing is very important in our fight against the virus.”However, on Thursday he retweeted a post suggesting the recent spike in Luton had been caused by “false tests”.In Luton, the rate actually fell to 24.8 cases per 100,000 in the week to July 20 from 31.8 the previous week, although Luton Borough Council said it had agreed with Government officials that gyms, pools, and other leisure facilities will not reopen as planned on July 25.Hazel Simmons, the council leader, said: Please pass these important messages on to your family and friends and if you can, stay at home.”Just 47 per cent of potentially-infected people in Luton were successfully contacted by the NHS Track and Trace system since its launch on May 28, amid concern that a language barrier is hampering success rates. Around a fifth of the population do not speak English as a first language, statistics show.As well as Luton, PHE has upgraded Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire to an area of intervention after 122 new cases were recorded in the seven days to July 20.NHS Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding said there were particular concerns about coronavirus spreading in South Asian communities in England.We are all learning what makes different communities, different professions, different parts of the country more vulnerable, she told the BBC.There are a mix of things, and certainly we are seeing a very high prevalence in the South Asian community across the country.All this comes after the mayor of Leicester, another coronavirus hotspot, was caught flouting the rules by visiting his girlfriend at the height of lockdown.Sir Peter Soulsby apologised in June for an “error of judgement”  after neighbours photographed him halfway up a ladder at his partner’s home.Cllr Malik did not respond to requests for comment.A spokesman for Luton Borough Council said: “The council has received complaints concerning the alleged conduct of three councillors.

This is all about reducing the harm that they do, not about them doing good.”A month later the project was announced and a LinkedIn post by Shell described offsets as “a vital part of tackling climate change” and something that allowed people to have a “positive impact”.Shell have denied that they were involved in greenwashing and said that they have “invested billions” in low carbon technologies. A spokesperson said: “We agree that action is needed now on climate change, so we fully support the Paris Agreement and the need for society to transition to a lower-carbon future. We’re committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs.”Simon Hodgson, FLS Chief Executive, said that he valued “the free and frank exchange of views amongst staff” but in the “long haul” of reducing carbon emissions “partnership working is essential”. “No one has the perfect, complete solution for the whole problem of tackling climate change but there are many smaller steps, including enabling more people and organisations to help us plant more trees in Scotland, that can be taken towards arriving at that solution. This is one of them for Forestry and Land Scotland,” he said.It is the second time that the Scottish Government has taken an investment from a major oil company to plant trees, after a £10million donation from BP in 2009.Emails show that FLS discussed the potential for other carbon offsetting projects on land that they own.Mel Evans, senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: Tree planting is crucial to fighting climate change, but Shell’s offsetting is merely a hollow gesture while it continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels - actively making the climate emergency worse.“Companies like Shell, BP, airlines and other high carbon pollution-creating industries want to use offsetting to continue business as usual, and that is a con. We can’t ignore the reality – we must cut carbon emissions, not accept false remedies like offsetting.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pc andrew harper case alleged jury tampering referred attorney","story":"The widow of Pc Andrew Harper said she was shocked and appalled after a jury cleared three teenagers of his barbaric murder on Friday, but convicted them of the lesser charge of manslaughter.The trio, who had sat laughing and smirking throughout the trial, were convicted amid allegations of jury intimidation and following the bizarre dismissal of one female juror who was seen repeatedly smiling at the killers during the judge’s summing up.A former policing minister said he was referring the trial to the Attorney General over fears that the jury may have been tampered with while Lord Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, suggested a retrial should have been ordered.Sir Paul Stephenson, the former politan Police Commissioner, said on Friday night he had deep concern.In an emotional statement outside the Old Bailey, Lissie Harper, who had only been married for four weeks when her “incredible, selfless and heroic” husband was dragged for more than a mile behind a car to his death last August, said: “Standing here, before all of you, I honestly thought I would be addressing you following a very different verdict... I am, for the second time in the space of one year, utterly shocked and appalled.The decisions made in these courts, by strangers, will never change the outcome that had already come to us. For many, many agonising months, we had hoped that justice would come in some way for Andrew.”Pc Harper’s killers – Henry Long, 19, and Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18 – hugged each other when the verdict was announced. During two trials – the first was abandoned in March as a result of the coronavirus lockdown – the gang from a travellers\u0027 community in Berkshire had been seen laughing in the dock.Even when Pc Harper\u0027s body was compared to a deer carcass after being dragged for more than a mile down country lanes in Berkshire, Bowers, Long and Cole continued smirking.The police officer had tried to intervene when he caught the gang stealing a quad bike. He became entangled in the tow rope attached to Long’s car and dragged to his death. The killers were traced to the Four Houses Corner travellers\u0027 site in Berkshire. Mrs Harper said that she and her family had put our faith in the justice system... to ensure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes and added but in reality, they make no difference to the heart-wrenching pain I will continue to feel for the rest of my life.Mrs Harper described his death at the age of 28 as brutal and senseless  and said she was immensely disappointed with the verdict.She paid tribute to a beautiful, loving human being and said: I now have my own life sentence to bear and believe me when I say it will be a much more painful, soul-destroying and treacherous journey than anyone facing a meagre number of years in prison will experience.Following the verdicts, it can now be disclosed that the judge, Mr Justice Edis, brought the first trial to a temporary halt over an alleged potential plot to intimidate jurors.An unidentified person in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom was seen pointing at jurors and the judge ordered extra security measures to protect the jury.Without ulging details, he said police had received information that an attempt is being considered by associates of the defendants to intimidate the jury.Then last Friday  July 17, towards the end of the second trial, an overly friendly juror was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the defendants in the dock and continually smiling at them. On being alerted to the incident, Mr Justice Edis said: She must have been compelled by some strong motive to have behaved as she did in this court under the observation of so many. It was both overt and covert at the time, which is remarkable behaviour.The female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining 11 men and women began deliberating on their verdicts.The disclosures caused alarm on Friday. Mike Penning, former policing and justice minister, said he would be writing to the Attorney General Suella Braverman to ask her to investigate.The one thing a jury should be  is completely detached in any shape or form from the people that are being tried. Clearly, the judge had concerns otherwise he would not have discharged the juror.”Lord Blunkett said: It throws considerable doubt on whether the whole of the jury should have been stood down and a retrial required. The verdict also raises issues that I think the law commission should lack in respect of the definition of murder because although it might not be premeditated, it was murder.Richard Benyon, the former Conservative MP for Newbury, whose land is close to the scene killing, said: To see this brutal killing result in such a verdict will cause incredulity in this part of Berkshire.The Attorney General and the Ministry of Justice both declined to comment.    All three of the defendants had denied murder although Long, the ringleader who was driving the saloon car dragging the body, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter.They will be sentenced next Friday but although still facing life for manslaughter are likely to serve far less prison time than if convicted of murder.The officer who led the investigation said the killers had showed no remorse and that their friends and relatives sought to frustrate his investigation.Detective Superintendent Stuart Blaik said: The fact he was a police officer and one of our own of course, it\u0027s paid a huge toll on all of us.”He said it was the defendants\u0027 criminality in stealing a quad bike that put them on course to meet Pc Harper and his colleague Pc Andrew Shaw, with catastrophic consequences.Mr Blaik said: Despite having worked a long shift already they responded to that, and tragically Andrew has paid the ultimate price for that.”The defendants had shown no remorse or helped police piece together what happened, he said, adding: They had every opportunity to do that and it was a conscious decision by them not to assist police from the very outset, all the way through, and even during the trial.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"retail therapy thing past shoppers face mask up friday","story":"A Friday afternoon in July should be the perfect excuse for a day of retail therapy. In lockdown, many will have missed spending the occasional day meandering in and out of shops with a friend, stopping for lunch and then again for coffee or an early glass of wine. But as shoppers arrived at stores today — with the government’s new policy on mask-wearing in full flow — it’s clear the days of leisurely shopping trips are no more. Every shopper is now required to wear a face covering or risk being fined on the spot. At Westfield shopping centre in west London, security guards sporadically stop people not wearing masks, many of whom remain uncertain about the new restrictions.Meanwhile, some shoppers are leaving ahead of schedule, unable to endure the stifling face coverings for long.Julie Piper, 48, says she had anticipated coming for the entire day with her 15-year-old daughter Lila and a friend just as she used to, but found having to wear a face mask too “claustrophobic” to bear.“I don’t think we’ll be here as long as we usually would be,” she says. “Usually we’d spend a good few hours here and really browse and eat and stuff. But I want to get out as soon as I can.”“Normally you come and spend the day, you stop for a coffee. But I don’t think I’d do it again, I wouldn’t rush back, this is terrible.”Being forced to keep her mask on makes the whole experience feel rather less like retail therapy, she says. “It’s not relaxing. You don’t feel you can just meander around and have a shop. You’ve got to do what you need to do and go.”As the centre fills up, some visitors manage to avoid being chastised. Lee Lock, 33, says he won’t be wearing a mask as he doesn’t believe they are necessary. What will he do if stopped and ask to wear one? Leave. But, he says: ’No one’s asked me to.”Josh Addison, 29, says he’ll only wear one if specifically asked to or if there is a “consequence” like the threat of a fine. “The guys at the front today were like ‘have you got a mask?’ And I said no, and they said ‘oh no it’s ok, just asking’. So that greeting alone tells me it’s optional.”Many shoppers simply hadn’t realised the rules on masks had changed. Sozan Jasser, 37, only thought to put her mask in her handbag this morning after a friend called to say she’d been threatened with a fine in her local petrol station. “Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t have been wearing one right now,” she says, adding that she is leaving early as the mask is making her feel faint.“It gives me anxiety, I feel suffocated, I feel strangled, I don\u0027t like it. I didn’t know you had to wear one today and right now I’m ready to go.“I’m not spending as long as I would have if I wasn’t having to wear this.”Not everyone is obliged to wear a mask. Kaz Mohamed, 35, wears a lanyard around his neck stating he is exempt for medical reasons. He has breathing difficulties exacerbated by wearing a mask but finds he has to defend his right not to wear one constantly. “I have to explain myself all the time.”One man holding a mask to his mouth as he walks around explains to a security guard that it broke on the train here. Nicholas Jackson, 62, says: “That’s the last thing I needed. When I got on the platform I sat down to put it on and it broke. I’ve been holding it on on the train all the way here.”Mr Jackson bought one as soon as he arrived so as to avoid further questions. “It’s not a great thing for me because I’ve got respiratory problems, but we’ll persevere.”Walking around the shopping centre, it’s easy to see why people are perplexed by the new rules, which seem to apply in some areas but not others.In some shops, including Topshop, LK Bennett and Marks and Spencer, staff are not required to wear face coverings even though customers are.And while shoppers must keep their faces covered even on the large, airy concourse, it seems they are not required to wear one when they stop at a coffee shop or if walking around having bite to eat.Many feel the new policy is a case of too little too late.As one shopper says. “It’s a bit of a contradiction the whole way through really. I’m just doing it because I have to.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden remains face mask free world","story":"Masks may only have been mandatory in British shops since yesterday, and British airports for a couple of months, but what I saw as I arrived in Sweden this past week already felt oddly transgressive, almost indecent.At no point on the journey does anyone tell you that you can remove your face mask, so when we landed in Stockholm, my fellow passengers on the quarter-full SAS flight from Heathrow kept them on up the gangway and into the airport terminal. Then you notice that the customs officers aren’t wearing them as they check your passport, nor the airport staff swooshing around on silent scooters, but you keep it on just in case.

In Sweden, it’s a mask-free world.In central Stockholm the restaurants and shops are busy, even if less busy than they might normally be there’s a table-service-only rule, so many bars have queues of patient Swedes outside to avoid any overcrowding inside. The outside watering holes of Stureplan and along the waterfront at Strandvägen are positively booming.There’s nothing reckless or denialist about the atmosphere here nor anything of the grim experiment-gone-wrong that much of the international media would have you believe about a country which did not impose a national lockdown.People are behaving responsibly, social distancing where possible, but determined to continue the serious business of living their lives. In the warm sunshine of a Stockholm evening, I got a sense of a people for whom unencumbered enjoyment of their brief summer — those precious moments of beauty and levity and warmth on the skin — is not a “nice-to-have” that should be surrendered on an uncertain cautionary principle. It is something closer to a human right.I interviewed the architect of Sweden’s Covid-19 policy, Anders Tegnell, for UnHerd’s LockdownTV.It’s fair to say he’s feeling chipper — suntanned, back from his own summer break, and looking at a set of coronavirus figures that are going rapidly in the right direction. Case numbers, having first surged as they massively increased testing, are now coming down dramatically admissions into ICU are now so low that for two days last week there were none at all (the first time that’s happened since early March) and deaths with Covid-19, despite being counted more stringently than almost anywhere in the world, are down to lower levels than ever since the peak.The uncomfortable fact remains that Sweden has had a much higher total mortality per capita than its Scandinavian neighbours (although still under that of the UK), but Tegnell insists that that was mainly the result of poor shielding of care homes, not their lack of lockdown. They’ve improved that and are now seeing the results. Certainly, whatever they are doing now seems to be working — and that doesn’t include wearing masks.Tegnell makes no secret of the fact that he is baffled by other countries’ rush to mandate face masks. “The evidence base for using masks in society is still very weak,” he tells me – despite lots of countries now mandating them in different ways “we haven’t seen any new evidence coming up, which is a little bit surprising I can say.” He believes that masks may be counter-productive as people then forget social distancing and even go out when they are ill, which ends up increasing the spread of the disease. And most importantly, things are going perfectly well without them. “At a time like right now, when we have extremely few admissions into hospitals and the total number of cases is rapidly falling, it is not the time to introduce something else.”All of which, of course, could be said of the UK as well.As a half-Swede I’ve been paying anxious attention to their more laissez-faire response to Covid-19. It seems fair to grant Tegnell his request of deferring full judgement until a year from now, once we know how other countries fare in the autumn and spring. But whatever the final outcome, there is something about the atmosphere of the discussion in Sweden that I wish we had a bit more of in the UK.Decisions are taken entirely by the health agency with almost no involvement from politicians, which lowers the temperature from the outset. Anders Tegnell is a physician and technocrat with no voters to please or polls to fret about. The prime minister has been keeping a distinctly low profile on the issue.There’s also a Swedish bloody-mindedness that in other scenarios can be maddening but in this context is a breath of fresh air. They will stick to their plan, make decisions based on their reading of the evidence, and not bow to social media furores or international condemnation, whether from their Nordic neighbours or the New York Times (who recently dubbed Sweden “the world’s cautionary tale”). At a time of such widespread insecurity and finger-pointing it feels like an oasis of calm.Most of all there’s a clarity about those aspects of life that are worth defending, even in the midst of a global pandemic. Swedish children have not missed a single day of education and they have protected the open society they cherish.Perhaps a culture’s readiness to change on a sixpence to a “new normal” is inversely correlated to their affection for, and confidence in, the “old normal.” The Swedes like their way of life, and are enviably reluctant to give it up.Freddie Sayers is executive editor of UnherdMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz english town now has highest coronavirus","story":"Following the week that the Queen\u0027s granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, secretly tied the knot, it\u0027s time test your knowledge on the last seven days of current affairs. It\u0027s been a promising week in Britain\u0027s search for a coronavirus vaccine, but which British university is leading the way with the success of recent human trials? In the world of sport, Dom Sibley reached his second test century, but how long did it take him to register his 100 runs against the West Indies? If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters closely you will have come across all of the answers to this week\u0027s quiz.

However, a rise in infections may be slower to emerge due to a lower prevalence of the virus in society.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyExperts on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) consider the R number a vitally important measure in tracking the spread of the virus.They have said the government’s goal should be to keep the value below one, leading to a fall in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths.If the R value is one, each person infected with the virus passes it on to one other person, meaning the prevalence of the virus in society will remain at the same level.However, if the value is two, each person carrying the virus transmits it to two people, leading to exponential spread.If the value falls below one, the prevalence of the virus in society begins to diminish over time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The R number is 0.8-1.0.In London, the growth rate is between -5 and 1 per cent, compared to between -3 and 2 per cent last week. The capital has an R value of 0.8-1.0.The Midlands has a growth rate of -5 per cent to zero, compared to -5 to minus -1 per cent last week. Its R value is 0.7-1.0.In the northeast and Yorkshire, the growth rate is between -4 per cent to zero, up from between -5 to -1 per cent last week. Its R number is 0.8-1.0.The northwest has a growth rate of -5 to -1 per cent, a change from -6 to -1 per cent, and an R value of 0.7-1.0.The growth rate in the southeast is at -3 to 1 per cent, compared with -4 per cent to zero last week. The R value in the region is 0.8-1.0.In the southwest, the growth rate changed from between -6 and 2 per cent last week to between -5 and 2 per cent. Its R value is 0.7-1.0.Across England however, the growth rate remains unchanged at between -4 per cent and zero, while the R value is 0.8-1.0.The Government Office for Science and Sage say in some regions the low case numbers andor a high degree of variability in transmission across the region means the estimates are insufficiently robust to inform policy decisions.Separate figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed an estimated 27,700 people were infected by coronavirus in the community, outside hospitals and care homes, in the week ending 19 July, an increase of 1,100 on last week’s numbers.Last month, Sir Patrick Vallance, England’s chief scientific adviser, said the country was approaching the point where the R number would no longer be a useful measure for reproduction as the smaller number of cases would mean local outbreaks could give a skewed impression.Epidemiologists have also stressed that estimates of R, which rely on predicting human behaviour as well as the ability of a virus to transmit, are imperfect and are constantly under revision.In March, the World Health Organisation said the coronavirus had a R value between 2 and 2.5, in a population with no immunity or social distancing measures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has faced continual delays trying to get the current-generation chips on sale already.The latest delay means that its 7nm chips – using even smaller architecture than the current 10nm chips – will not be available until 2022, because of a problem with manufacturing them, Intel said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut it indicated during its otherwise positive results that it had identified the problem and was working to fix it.Intel had hoped that it could make up for some of the delays with the 10mm chips, which had to be pushed back by two years due to repeated delays, by keeping to time with its 7mm designs.Apple buys Intel 5G modem business, dropping major hint at new iPhoneBut the new sixth month delay means that the chips will not be available until 2022, with full production not available until the following year.The company may be forced to have some of them produced by external manufacturers as part of contingency plans, it suggested. Intel is somewhat unusual among chip makers in that it both designs and manufactures its chips, before selling them to other companies to include in their own computers.While customers generally don\u0027t buy the chips themselves, such delays can lead to consumer devices being pushed back too – or not appearing at all.Some Apple computers are thought to have already been delayed or changed as a result of Intel\u0027s chips not becoming available, for instance.

The pop star collaborated with a number of her “musical heroes” for the record, including her frequent songwriting partner and co-producer Jack Antonoff, plus The National’s Aaron Dessner, and Bon Iver. Upon the album’s release, Swift shared a prologue of sorts explaining her thoughts and feelings surrounding the album. The prologue will also feature in packaging for CD and vinyl versions of Folklore.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRead the prologue in full below:“It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.Alanis Morissette’s Such Pretty Forks in the Road is a career bestTaylor Swift fans think Karlie Kloss dropped a Folklore Easter Egg “Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of “let’s run away” and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.“Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn’t his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.“A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone’s secrets written in the sky for all to behold.“In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I’ve told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.“Now it’s up to you to pass them down.”Swift’s album has received critical claim in early reviews. The Independent gave it four stars and called it a “near-perfect album”, praising Swift’s songwriting as “exquisite, piano-based poetry”.Read the full review here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine LaGarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the sight of Mr Erdogan leading the prayer stunned observers, with some describing it as yet another blow to Turkey\u0027s secular republican system. In practice what we’ve seen here is the fusion of religious leadership and political leadership, said Kadri Gursel, an analyst in Istanbul. It is the transgressing of borders between the political and religious leadership, and the embodiment of the two in one person. It’s a historical moment no one can deny it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Mr Erdogan\u0027s recitation, the head of Turkey\u0027s religious affairs ministry, Ali Erbas, took to the pulpit to deliver a sermon which touched on themes of Muslim victimisation. What could be more crestfallen than a mosque, the minarets of which are silent, the garden of which is deserted, the dome of which is mute, and the garden of which is lonely? he said. Due to the hostility to Islam that rises each passing day, there are mosques in various parts of the world today that are attacked, closed by force, and even bombed and destroyed, he said. Hundreds of millions of Muslims are facing oppression... We as believers who regard the meaning of Hagia Sophia as a lofty cause and sacred entrustment need to work to ensure that compassion, tolerance, peace, tranquillity, and benevolence prevail all around the world.Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia had been officially a museum until two weeks ago when Mr Erdogan redesignated it a Muslim house of worship following a court decision. The move was controversial, potentially damaging an institution that was seen as a symbol of interfaith harmony between Muslims and Christians and a nod to the secular legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey. But the move proved popular among supporters of Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party as well as strident Turkish nationalists. Hundreds of pious Turks could be seen rushing towards the Hagia Sophia to take part in Friday’s ceremony, some chanting “God is great”.The enduring fight for the Hagia SophiaIstanbul’s iconic Hagia Sophia to be turned back into mosqueThe debate over the future of Hagia Sophia explains modern TurkeyErdogan recites Islamic prayer at Hagia Sophia triggering outcry Turkish media reported thousands of worshippers arriving from around the country to witness the prayers, with officials beseeching potential visitors to stay away from the area to avoid overcrowding around the leafy square and ancient quarters near the Hagia Sophia amid the coronavirus pandemic. Turkey continues to report hundreds of new infections daily, adding to a total caseload approaching a quarter of a million. The Hagia Sophia, considered among the most cherished masterpieces of Byzantine-era architecture, was converted into a mosque following the 16th-century Ottoman conquest of the city that was then Constantinople. Its status as a museum has long irked pious Turks alienated by the country’s secularist governments.

The parenthesis of the last century when we were doomed with defeats is closed.”Turkish pro-government voices mocked opposition leaders for not attending the prayer ceremony. But Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), said that he was not invited. Kemal Kılıcdaroglu, chairman of the CHP, rejected an invitation to attend the ceremony. Mr Gursel described the ceremony, which coincided with the anniversary of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne that outlined the contours of modern Turkey, as a political move intended to rejuvenate the AKP\u0027s base of supporters at a time of multiple overlapping crises. We see today an Erdogan exhausted and deprived of instruments offering him better positioning and better terrain to generate legitimacy, he said. Turkey\u0027s economy is in shambles. The future is grim. Its foreign policy is in crisis, Its society is in crisis. Mr Erdogan is out of capacity to solve any of the existing crises.Turkish officials have said the Hagia Sophia, a major tourism draw, would continue to be open to visitors of all faiths, and that entrance fees would be lifted. For prayer services, Turkish religious authorities have covered up Christian religious icons showing human imagery considered idolatrous in the Sunni sect of Islam. There are, however, plans to allow them to be visible except for during five daily prayer times. Turquoise prayer rugs have also been installed as part of an ongoing renovation.  Some historical preservationists have expressed concern. “It appears that the authorities have chosen to instal a (presumably retractable) curtain mechanism to conceal the mosaics of Virgin and Child on the apse, and the Archangel Gabriel,” wrote Washington-based Turkey scholar Tugba Tanyeri-Erdemir, voicing concern about the mere two-week period used to prepare the building for prayers.“The choice of materials for the curtain is crucial. Is the fabric concealing Hagia Sophia\u0027s mosaics fire retardant? Is it evaluated for pest control and dust accumulation?” she wrote on Twitter. “When we are dealing with ancient buildings we need to carefully assess all risk factors.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Vladimir Putin has awarded the rank of major general to Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov – a man who has been linked to the killing, torture and disappearance of hundreds.   Mr Kadyrov, who published the new honour on his social media pages on Thursday, said the Russian president had called him personally to read out the executive order.“It is a high distinction that I value highly,” he wrote. “I’m the president’s loyal solider, and ready to carry out any order on any continent he wishes.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe move comes less than three days after the US State Department announced the blacklisting the controversial strongman and his family. On Monday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the sanctions were the result of “numerous gross violations of human rights dating back more than a decade”.Thursday’s development appeared to be a direct response to the US snub, and was trailed two days ago when foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova first responded to the US move. “It will be difficult to respond reciprocally, but we will think up something,” she said.  Mr Kadyrov’s own response fell much in line with his brand. In a message on Telegram – his Instagram, and Facebook accounts have been suspended – he posted a picture of himself brandishing two guns. “Pompeo, we accept the fight!” the caption read. “What comes next will be more interesting.” Since assuming power from his assassinated father in 2004, the tiger-loving strongman has ruled Chechnya as a personal fiefdom. He enjoys autonomy unrivalled among any other regional leader – the result of a grand security bargain to keep order following two bloody wars with Moscow. Chechen leader denies gay massacre saying ‘such people do not exist’The strongman has used the deal to deliver personal riches and a regime of terror, with critics frequently disappearing in mysterious circumstances. Mr Kadyrov is understood to have supported several waves of repressions of LGBT+ people beginning in 2017. At least three men have died, with dozens missing, and hundreds more reporting torture. Russian authorities have refused to investigate the evidence, or open a criminal case. Igor Kochetkov, whose Russian LGBT Network led the frontline emergency effort to evacuate at-risk citizens, said the honour underlined the Kremlin’s attitude to human rights abuse. “The authorities are showing they don’t want to investigate Kadyrov’s crimes,” Mr Kochetkov told The Independent. “The award of military titles and honours tells him everything he needs to know.”  No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

US Central Command said that two F-15 fighter jets approached the Mahan Air flight to conduct a “standard” visual inspection at a “safe distance” of 1,000 metres.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have no interest in escalation, but we will do all that is necessary to protect Israeli citizens.”Shortly after the blast on Friday morning, the IDF said that it was ”elevating its readiness to defend Israel’s northern border from all enemy threats with changes to troop deployment and enhanced field intelligence activity in the area”.Shortly after its retaliatory strikes, the IDF tweeted: We hold the Syrian regime responsible and will respond to any violation of Israeli sovereignty.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK. The largest  employ , people.But let’s not forget they need us too.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right now the range of possibilities is from very early success through to we never get a vaccine against COVID-. What weve got with the Oxford result is clear proof that that vaccine produces a really good immune response in humans. It is very encouraging indeed. Im now cautiously optimistic that this vaccine may work. Were taking those financial risks to run the programmes as fast as we can. Weve already managed to secure  million doses of future supply of the Oxford vaccine.My best estimates are thatthis continues to run with the success that we have had so far, it would not be unreasonable to think that we will be getting some doses of that vaccine this side of Christmas. The UK has also signed deals for options on two other vaccines. When you get to the point where youve got a vaccine concept thats reasonable, then the success rate is typically about ten per cent. And what that tells you is that, to be sure that youre going to get a vaccine, you need multiple shots on goal. You’ve got to back more than one horse, and the UK Government is doing that. We are expecting to host five or six big vaccine trials in the UK in the autumn and yesterday we launched a website to allow the public to register their interest to take part in the trial. We are hoping to have , people per trial, so up to , participants. We’re not looking just for -year-olds, but people from a range of backgrounds and comorbidities. Im a glass half full man.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet. Without the tolerance bit.A last-breath act of motherly concern that was perhaps down to the phenomenon known as “hysterical strength” – where human beings suddenly find an extreme power in a le-or-death situation.Either way, how heartbreaking that she couldn’t also save herself.THIS is the cover of Sports Illustrated’s  “swimsuit” issue.Or, in the case of Jasmine Sanders, centre, three strategically placed pieces of dental floss.Doubt she’d hear them from LA anyway.GHISLAINE Maxwell broke down in tears while appearing via video link in a New York court.Reportedly, this was because she was denied bail.

And so, consequently, we have gravitated towards the nostalgic food brands that remind us of that time.Though it has to be said that The Bloke’s Heinz Mushroom And Bacon Toast Topper he purchased back in  is a step too far and remains untouched.He was stopped by Border Force teams.Either that or, just like the rest of us, he hired it for an hour and, a few minutes in, drted aimlessly after becoming paralysed with boredom.ONLINE dating frauds have soared by  per cent as con artists exploit loneliness in lockdown then ask to borrow money.The most vulnerable targets were women aged  to .With this in mind, here is my cut-out-and-keep guide to hopefully minimise the chances of this happening to you. If he tells you he’s a spy then he almost certainly isn’t.If he says he’s an airline pilot, only believe it when you see him sitting in a cockpit in full unorm.If he claims all his money is “stuck in Panama”, he’s penniless and after your cash.And finally,he goes incommunicado for several days and claims his phone broke, he’s probably been away with his we and four kids.You have been warned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And hotly anticipated family holidays have had to be cancelled because of worries over passport delays.Yesterday, Boris Johnson and his cabinet met in person for the first time in months to set an example that it’s safe to go back to work. But civil servants are still nowhere to be seen.They need to get all hands back on deck and be thankful that, unlike countless others, they still have jobs to go back to.PUBS and restaurants might be open again, but their problems are far from over.As head of the National Time Out campaign Jonathan Downey explains, hundreds of small businesses are closing their doors for the last time just as punters cautiously start to .Why  Because despite being forbidden from making money during lockdown, publicans and bar owners are now expected to cough up their rental payments — ­in full — to their landlords.We know there’s no quick fix.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering.

And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job.

He orders a double chicken parmo.For those of you not from Teesside, here’s what a parmo, pictured, is. A breast of chicken hammered flat. Then coated in bread- crumbs and deep fried. Then smothered in creamy bechamel sauce. And then with loads of Red Leicester on top of that.You eat it with chips and it’s , calories.

Yup, amigo, it’s the dreaded “second spike” we’ve all been worried about.But people from the UK can still travel to Spain unhindered. And Spaniards can travel here without restriction.The Government says it will look at inidual countries and,need be, take them off the “air-bridge” list. Here’s my suggestion, Boris. Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris. Keep us safe.THE BBC will not rest until all the statues of Winston Churchill are torn down and his memory besmirched.Earlier this week the corporation broadcast a semi-literate tirade of abuse about Churchill’s “racism” and supposed brutality towards Indians.It was by a woman called Yogita Limaye. There was no discussion about the matter. Churchill was a racist, and that’s that. Also he caused the deaths of three million people in Bengal through a famine in .As it happens, the famine was caused by a tropical cyclone. These pieces were not “news” and so should not have been on The Ten O’Clock News. Andthey were to appear anywhere they should have been balanced. They were not balanced.Another case of the BBC virtue- signalling its wokeness. And infuriating viewers and listeners for whom Churchill remains rather more of a hero than does Yogita Limaye.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the pandemic worsened and HMS Bubble restrictions were imposed.They have enjoyed being side by side again and exercised together with only a handful of staff disturbing their peace.But the Queen has continued to work and received her red boxes containing official documents from the Government.And royal sources have described how her spirits were buoyed by last week’s wedding of her granddaughter Beatrice, , and property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, , which was the kind of close-knit affair the monarch has always enjoyed.  It was the first time she had seen members of her family since March. Now aides are hastily trying to arrange more family reunions when the Duke and the Queen extend their time together for their annual summer stay at Balmoral in Scotland next month.With Harry and Meghan in LA and Andrew facing questions over Epstein, sources revealed the Queen has also taken great pride in William and Kate spearheading the fam- ily’s res- ponse to the Covid crisis.The “Iron Duke” — who spent four nights in hospital over Christmas as a precautionary measure for what Palace officials called a “pre-existing condition” — is delighted to be leading from the front.Invigorated by isolation, he looked back to his best in photos at Beatrice and Edo’s surprise wedding at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park.Then he briefly stepped out of retirement on Wednesday to hand over his role as Commander-in-Chief of The Rles regiment to the Duchess of Cornwall.And he surprised everyone by walking down four steps and making a wisecrack to LCpl Colin Streetin.He asked the soldierhe was keeping fit and they both had a chuckle when bugler Colin replied: “Are you trying to say I am fat ” It is the sort of cheeky humour that Philip has become associated with during his many decades of public service.The duke was a dashing naval captain when he met the young Princess Elizabeth before the Second World War.They traded letters during the conflict and smitten Philip kept a photo of the future Queen.Philip and Elizabeth married in November  at Westminster Abbey. The duke gave up his Navy career when Elizabeth was crowned in .At her coronation, he pledged to “become your liege man of le and limb”. But he reportedly struggled to play second fiddle and was accused of affairs during their fledgling marriage, which have never been proven.A storyline In TV drama The Crown, featuring Philip having a fling with a Russian ballet dancer, was dismissed as fiction.At the couple’s th wedding anniversary in , the Queen said: “He has, quite simply, been my strength and my stay all these years.”After the duke retired three years ago, having clocked up , solo engagements since , the Queen spent weekdays at Buckingham Palace with a heavy workload before spending weekends on her own at Windsor Castle.Insiders say the duke was happy reading, painting and staying active and regularly spoke with the Queen on the telephone. Dickie Arbiter, former Buckingham Palace spokesman, said: “They get on very well. He has been at Sandringham becausehe stays in London and Windsor there is not a lot for him to do.”But after their Balmoral break they will have spent seven months by each other’s side — and aides are now working to keep them together.Traditionally at their Scottish home the Queen and Prince Philip have been hands-on and famously in charge of a family barbecue.The couple also welcome friends and family to the estate, although this year meetings will take place outdoors.They will travel together with a new HMS Bubble of up to  loyal staff.And no doubt the Queen and Prince Philip will be looking forward to spending as much time together as they can.Her Majesty and Prince Philip looked delighted and relaxed when photographed a socially-distanced gap from Beatrice and Edo last Friday.Their surprise wedding was only the second occasion the Queen had mixed with people outside her HMS Bubble.It signalled a carefully arranged end to her four-month-long isolation at Windsor Castle.The intimate and private ceremony had between  and  guests, allowing the Queen to see her family for the first time since March.Without the pomp and fanfare of previous royal weddings, which had taken months and years to arrange, there was very little stress involved.Instead, the Queen and duke, aided by staff, made themselves look immaculate and were chauffeur-driven the three miles to All Saints Chapel.Spending only  minutes at the Covid-secure ceremony meant they had enough time to see their granddaughter marry and greet sorely-missed family, including scandal-hit Prince Andrew.Beatrice and Edo also cheered the Queen by picking a date and chapel where she could attend before heading off to Balmoral next month.If the wedding had been much later then preparations for the August trip to the Scottish Highlands would be in full swing.And it meant she could still be back at Windsor Castle in time to hand a knighthood to Captain Tom Moore.Aides believe it was an easing back into engagements and social le for the Queen and duke.Plans are now under way to attempt more family reunions at Balmoral.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Officers will be there to help storesneeded - but only as a last resort, as we simply do not have the resources.Many supermarkets and cafes have already said they will not enforce the new measures.Asda, Sainsburys and Costa Coffee have said it is not their responsibility to ‘police customers. Sainsburys said while it is asking everyone to continue “playing their part” in helping to keep shoppers safe by following the rules, “our colleagues will not be responsible for enforcing them”. Asda said it will “strongly encourage customers to wear a face covering,” but added: “It is the responsibility of the relevant authorities to police and enforce the new rules.”Costa Coffee said it would “not be challenging customers who enter our stores without a mask since they may have a legitimate reason as to why they are unable to wear one”.Tesco will be selling face coverings at the entrance and Waitrose said staff would be at the doors to remind customers of the requirement.But customers will be “required” to wear a face covering in Greggs.To add to the problems, some police forces have also said they wont be enforcing the wearing of masks in shops. Devon and Cornwall police became the first force in the UK to admit officers will not respond to calls about shoppers refusing to wear masks. Thames Valley police have also announced the same. And Met chief Dame Cressida Dick said she hopes people will be “shamed” into wearing face coverings rather than having to be fined.She said cops would only intervene “as a last resort” orcustomers become “aggressive”. The PM’s spokesman said shopkeepers should only “escalate” matters to policecustomers refuse to wear a mask or leave their store.He added: “The overwhelming majority of the public can be trusted to follow the rules without any need for enforcement action.”It has already been compulsory for travellers to wear a mask on public transport since June , .Asda strongly encourages customers to wear a face covering, but staff will not be policing customers.Sainsburys staff will not challenge anybody without a mask in store.Tesco says customers will be required to wear face coverings while shopping, but people will not be refused entry without one.Aldi customers will need to wear a face covering to enter any store from July .Waitrose says it is not for supermarkets to enforce the wearing of face coverings but staff will be at store entrances to remind shoppers of the new laws.Lidl shoppers will not be turned away for not wearing a covering as the supermarket says it is the responsibility of the inidual.Co-op staff will also not be imposing the new rules on shoppers as the supermarket says it is for the police to enforce.Marks  Spencer staff will not enforce the wearing of face masks but will be manning store entrances to provide polite reminders and encouragement to do so.Iceland says it trusts customers to adhere to the rules around mandatory face coverings and to shop in a safe and responsible way, so will not be refusing entry to those not wearing a mask.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess. Finding all the mixtapes I made for girlfriends who’d just left me, and reliving the sadness to the accompaniment of Phil Collins.DAVID BECKHAM wishes to build a pond in his back garden, which is good news for insects, birds and wildle in general, but apparently it’s not such good news for his neighbours, who say there are already too many ponds in the area so another is not neededToo many ponds  I think what they meant to say is: “We are bitter and so twisted with jealousy that we want to make Mr Beckham’s le as miserable as ours have turned out to be.”OVER the past few years, cigarette sales in Britain have plummeted by million a month.Experts are struggling to understand why there has been such a massive fall and why it happened so quickly.Some say the health warnings are being effective. Some say it’s the cost. Some say it’s the ban on smoking indoors.I, however, know exactly what’s ­responsible.Exactly three years ago this week, the world’s heaviest smoker quit.

It is by Jimmy McGovern, who wrote Cracker, Hillsborough and The Street.As part of our Time For Change campaign, Stuart Lawrence, brother of murdered teen Stephen Lawrence, saw a preview. He tells Alison Maloney his reaction, and his hopes for the future . . .ONE of the hardest things to do,  years on from my brother Stephen’s death, is to imagine what his le would have been likehe had lived.So watching the drama Anthony — which imagines the unlived le of murdered teenager Anthony Walker — was incredibly emotional for me.Like Stephen, Anthony was just  when he was killed in an unprovoked racist attack in . Like Stephen, he was a bright, ambitious young man from a quiet family who just wanted to go about their lives.Like Stephen, he wasn’t the aggressor. He was just trying to do a decent thing, walking his girlfriend and friend to the bus stop, when he was senselessly attacked and lost his le in a Liverpool park.The new BBC drama, written by Jimmy McGovern at the request of Anthony’s mother Gee Walker, starts six years after the horric attack and imagines Anthony as a lawyer, married with a daughter.From there it works backwards to the tragic day he was taken, on July ,  years ago, and the unusual structure makes it even more heart- wrenching because it shows the possibilities lost in that moment.I feel great respect for the family, who have been brave enough to look through that lens of what could have happenedAnthony was allowed another six years on this planet.People ask me what Stephen would be like now, at , and I find those questions hard because I don’t want to think about what could have been.It’s like tormenting yourself because you go down a path of possibilities that can never come true.Anthony had just done his A levels and wanted to become a civil rights lawyer when he died. Stephen wanted to be an architect.Would he have been a great architect  Would he have been a husband and father What would our relationship be like now Stephen was two years older than me and was a typical big brother — a great role model, great friend, and annoyingly good at everything.He set the bar high for me and I’m still trying to live up to that and be the best person I can possibly be. In turn, I try to be the same for my younger sister, Georgina.It’s heartbreaking that families have to experience the loss of a young le in their prime, when they’re just about to go off and make a dference in the world.But this drama sends an incredibly important message about what happens when a young le is lost.Anthony saves his best friend’s le, after finding him sleeping on the streets, and him not being there meant that that intervention wouldn’t have happened.And who knows what his daughter would have gone on to do, after seeing the great work that her father did  That’s what happens when a young le is snuffed out.You will never knowthat was the one person in the world who could have solved global warming, poverty, the world’s famine. You will never discover where that person’s journey would have taken them. By the time Anthony was killed,  years after Stephen, I had been teaching for two years and I had hoped that things were getting better.His death came as a massive shock, because it echoed so many characteristics of what happened to Stephen, so I was all too aware of the impact this would have on his family and siblings.It was a reminder that, while many mindsets had moved forward, some people’s attitudes hadn’t changed.I get a lot of hatred on social media, people saying that somehow we are using Stephen’s death for personal gain, but I always say to people, ‘Walk a mile in my shoes’.I would much rather not be talking about these issues, but have a normal le and still have my brother.When I want advice, I can go to my parents, but I should also be able to go to my older brother and I don’t have that.For me, that’s a massive gap in my le and leaves me with a sense of loneliness that never goes away. Right now,  years after Anthony’s death, racism is still as big a problem as it was then, with social media acting as a breeding ground.Just today, on my own feeds, there is abusive language, hysteria and  truths about my brother and who he was as a person.ON the evening of July , , Anthony Walker, his girlfriend Louise Thompson and cousin Marcus Binns were waiting to catch a bus in Huyton, Liverpool.After spotting them, Michael Barton, then , began hurling racist abuse so they walked away, to cut through a park to another bus stop.Fellow attacker Paul Taylor, then , told Barton he had “lost face” and the pair launched their vicious attack.Louise and Marcus ran for help but Anthony was fatally wounded when Taylor hit him in the head with an ice pick. He died in hospital a few hours later.In the days that followed, Barton, brother of footballer Joey, and Taylor fled to Amsterdam. Joey, then  and at Manchester City, issued appeals for them toand hand themselves in, calling the crime “horric” and “senseless”.He said he had not been brought up with his brother and his “side of the family” were “sickened” by the death of a “kind, decent young man”. He said in one plea to his brother: “Do this for the Walker family so they can mourn Anthony and because you know it is the right thing to do.”The killers flew back to the UK on August  and were arrested at Liverpool airport.In December  they were convicted of murder and sentenced to le, with a minimum of  years and eight months for Taylor and  years and eight months for Barton. Lord Justice Leveson said the cousins had perpetrated a “terrying ambush” and a “racist attack of a type poisonous to any civilised society”.Earlier this month, a -year-old was arrested for racially abusing Crystal Palace footballer Wilfried Zaha, so we need to get better at stamping this out.Education is a big part of it, and I have been calling for an element of citizenship, taught from reception to when schoolkids leave at , because with skills and knowledge they can really understand how they fit into the world we live in today. I also think we need to hold some adults to account because, as teachers, we can provide the education but they are more influenced by their parents and the adults who support them.So I can spend all day telling them the right thing to do but they go home and hear something .I am a father and,my nine-year-old son was a teenager, like most parents I would be fearful when he went out because the kne crime and violence out there is crazy.But I try to be as hopeful and open-minded as possible because,it’s all doom and gloom, what’s the point of it all  We might as well give up and say, ‘Our kids are always going to have to face this’.I believe we can make a dference over the next ten years. We’ve got to try to keep on pushing the narrative of equality for everyone because,we don’t, nothing will change.That’s why I took part in The Sun’s recent Time For Change QA, along with Anthony Joshua, Trevor Phillips, Patrick Hutchinson and Katharine Birbalsingh, because it’s an issue we need to keep discussing.The Black Lives Matter movement, after the death of George Floyd in the US, was a great way to start the conversation and, this time, it feels like it has a worldwide momentum, rather than being an isolated case in America or in the UK.Anthony, this powerful drama, is another way to add to the crucial conversation.As a family, through the Stephen Lawrence Foundation, we have tried to make Stephen’s legacy a change for the good.Yes, a terrible tragedy happened to us as a family but in light of that we have been able to go forth and change people’s minds and attitudes and provide le experiences, and opportunities.Similarly, Anthony’s mum Gee carries on her son’s legacy with the Anthony Walker Foundation.She visits schools and does work-shops to show people the implications of one rash moment in time and how it can affect you and your le, and other people’s lives as well.She spreads messages of racial harmony and I know she’s out there doing great work.I am a hopeful person because, without hope, we can never change what is wrong in society.There has to be a positive out of the negative because, otherwise, it’s just been a le lost and all the hurt and pain has been for nothing.In response, The Sun this month launched our Time For Change campaign with a  discussion on how to make a lasting dference.Our  was made up of figures from across public le, including Stuart, boxing champ Anthony Joshua, Black Lives Matter protest hero Patrick Hutchinson, “super head” Katharine Birbalsingh and Trevor Philips, ex-head of the Human Rights Commission.Ex-teacher Stuart now concentrates on the Stephen Lawrence Foundation, to use his brother’s legacy to promotion equality, ersity and education.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: One of the lessons I drew fromis the need for us all to be fitter and healthier. If we’re fitter and healthier by the way, we will also be happier. And heres the key thing,were fitter and healthier, andwe lose weight, well be better able not just to inidually withstand coronavirus, but well do a great deal to protect the NHS. Thats why well be bringing forward an obesity strategy.Under plans being finalised by ministers, junk food adverts could be banned online and before the pm watershed to stop kids getting hooked on unhealthy grub.Shops could also be barred from promoting unhealthy food and drink products in store as part of a drive to improve the health of the nation.He will unveil the Government’s new obesity strategy on Monday.Obesity is a major risk factor in people getting seriously ill from the virus, medical experts say.Speaking to Sky News this morning as he urged everyone to get the flu vaccine this winter to protect the NHS, the PM said: Im on the way, Ive lost about a stone and a bit.Primarily by eating less, but also by a lot of exercise.BORIS Johnson today admitted that the Government could have handled the coronavirus crisis dferentlySpeaking on the anniversary of becoming PM, he wouldnt be drawn on what mistakes had been made during his handling of it.He said in an interview with BBC News this evening: Maybe there were things we could have done dferently, as Ive said, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done dferently.But what I think the public wants us to do now is to focus on getting the preparations ready for what, as I say, could be a resurgence of the virus this winter.And he added: When you look back at this crisis, everybody can see that this was something that was new, that we didnt understand in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months.The single thing that we didnt see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person. That wasnt clear to us or to anybody.The PM stressed there would be plenty of time to look back at all the things that must be learned from the crisis.Last week he promised an independent inquiry into the virus, but didnt say when it would happen or who would lead it.The PM was asked about suggestions the Government may ban junk food adverts before the watershed, and said: Im not normally a believer in nannying... type of politics.Losing weight is, frankly, one of the ways that you can reduce your own risks from Covid.He didnt go into any more detail about what the new obesity strategy might involve.But earlier today Tim Rycroft, COO at the Food and Drink Federation, blasted the plans as a slap in the face for the industry.The Government is about to, it seems, deliver a slap in the face to the food industry which has worked so heroically over the past four months to keep the nation fed, at some considerable risk to itself.Its going ban promotions of food ten days before the Chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen.Its going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters on a time where the economy is in quite a tenuous situation.The result of this will be higher prices for shoppers, less choice.And all of this to reduce our average intake per day by  calories.He said it was extraordinary the Government was still focused on the idea of a watershed, when the world was now digital and online. He also warned that prices could go uppromotions were curbed.He added: These promotions, help make food cheaper that’s an imp thing at the moment. The government’s figures show that the average family will spend £ more on their shoppingthere are no promotional discounts. Is that something we really want to do at the moment when people are so hard pressed John OConnell, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, added: Hard-pressed hungry shoppers don’t need Boris piling on the pounds to their weekly food bill. Ministers are telling taxpayers to eat out to help out the economy, but also want to abolish the kind of price promotions which keep costs down and make everyday food affordable for millions. If it wants people to be out shopping, providing for their families and keeping the economy afloat, the government needs to stop this silly supermarket snobbery. Boris is said to have been persuaded by medical and nutritional advisers that tackling obesity is  per cent diet and  per cent exercise.  The radical plans contrast with the PM’s previous opposition to nanny state interventions but in May he said he had undergone a “damascene conversion” following his own brush with death after catching coronavirus, which disproportionately affects overweight men.He said he the coronavirus pandemic had convinced him that urgent action was needed to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis.But The Sun revealed last week that he had drawn a red line at fresh sugar taxes as he does not want to people to feel “bullied” into eating healthier.Instead he and Health Secretary Matt Hancock hope a ban on online adverts and pre-pm TV ads will change people’s shopping and eating habits.

Under the new rules, exercise equipment will be spaced out and class sizes reduced to allow social distancing. Dance classes and exercise sessions are likely to have markings on the floor to show you where to stand. People will be encouraged to arrive in their kit and to travel home to shower afterwards, although showers will be available. Lockers are likely to be out of bounds and visitors should bring their own water as fountains will not be in use in many facilities.Some gyms are planning to take people’s temperatures at the door, with handwashing facilities and sanitiser to be provided. Customers should pre-book their sessions and pay in advance, and one-way systems will be in place to reduce contact between gym-goers. However masks will not be mandatory for those visiting the gym, unlike in shops, supermarkets and public transport where they must be worn.The exceptions to this are in Leicester, Luton and Blackburn - where gyms and indoor pools cannot reopen due to high local coronavirus rates.Here are nine ways gyms and swimming pools will look very dferent as they reopen on Saturday. . You should arrive in your sports kit - and go home sweaty  While showers and changing rooms are allowed to reopen, people are asked to - wherever possible - arrive in their sports kit. After playing, they should then in general avoid using the showers or changing roomspossible, and simply go home sweaty. This will reduce the risk of transmission in changing rooms. The guidance says changing rooms must be open for those with disabilities or special needs, and are likely to be needed after swimming. . There wonapost be as many lockers  Lockers will remain open in general, but some of them could be shut to ensure people space out. For example, gyms could ensure social distancing by limiting use to alternate lockers. Lockers should also be kept clean and clear of personal items where thataposs possible - and cleaned regularly when used. . You may need to book a time slot  Gyms will be told to limit the number of people they can have inside at any given time. Part of that suggestion is that inidual facilities use a booking system to make sure that gyms are not overcrowded. It would also provide a handy list to for contact tracerssome did later test positive for the virus. . There will be far fewer people  Gyms have been asked to reduce the number of people inside dramatically - with only one person per  metre squared in the facility. The same rule applies to space in a swimming pool. However, gyms will be allowed to include changing room space, and other indoor facilities like tennis courts, when calculating the number of people that will be allowed in. . Classes will be smaller Exercise class sizes are to be slashed in order to reduce the number of people coming into contact with one another. Another change will be increasing the amount of time between exercise classes. That will avoid people queuing outside classrooms and allow time to clean facilites like shared bikes and other equipment. And gyms should consider limiting the number of classes that rotating instructors teach, to minimise exposure. . Your dance class could be limited to within a line of tape  Temporary floor markings are recommended for dance and exercise studios. They would be used to mark out the required spacing per inidual while people jump up and down. . There will be one way systems Throughout the gym, expect to see one way systems to reduce the chance of exercisers bumping into one another. It might mean changes to peopleaposs exercise routine - but it might also be an incentive not to skip aposleg dayapos. .

A survey of , UK adults revealed almost a thirdare confused when it comes to money and finances, with the meaning of AER and capital gains tax also leaving many scratching their heads. The dference between a money transfer and a balance transfer, what it means to be in negative equity and what APR stands for also feature in the list of confusing terms. It also emerged  per cent wish they had learnt more about money in school, with  per cent admitting most of their knowledge has come from trying to manage their own finances. The research was commissioned by Virgin Money as part of itsapos Money on your Mindapos service, which connects a team of financial experts with customers to answer their questions and provide support. A spokesperson for Virgin Money said: Our personal finances are one of the most important things we deal with in our lives and it is easy to be overwhelmed by all the money-related jargon we regularly encounter. It is clear from our research that people wish they were better informed about financial terminology from a younger age. Whether weaposre looking to join the property ladder, consolidate our finances or buy a new car, itaposs important that we have a better understanding of how these processes work so weaposre in the best position possible. Despite the housing market being a hot topic following the Chancelloraposs recent announcements,  per cent admitted they didnapost know what loan-to-value means, while  per cent were unaware what Stamp Duty is. And one quarter said they didnapost understand capital gains tax while  per cent didnapost know the dference between a direct debit and a standing order.Other financial terms which leave Brits confused include apos equity release apos, the aposBank of England base rateapos and aposPAYEapos.

And half of respondents also werenapost sure what a aposballoon paymentapos - the optional final payment at the end of a finance agreement - was. But the study revealed the biggest catalyst for learning about money and finances is buying a home , followed by taking out a credit cardand starting a pension . And  per cent of respondents said finding themselves in debt was the reason they started to learn more about money. As a result of the lack of knowledge,  per cent of those polled via OnePoll wished it was simpler to ask their bank questions about finances and money. The findings come after internal data from Virgin Money revealed one quarter of the enquiries it has received from customers through its Money on your Mind service over the past two months have been classied as Covid- related.  These included queries such as aposhow long will my mortgage holiday lastapos, aposcan I extend my mortgage holidayapos, aposhow do I get a refund on flights I have had cancelledapos and issues around getting refunds from holiday companies which havenapost been responding to requests. More than one in  queries to Money on your Mind were related to aposdigital accessapos for issues such as forgetting their password, registering for online banking and arranging an online money transfer.

The little girlaposs mother then threw a glass of water over her distressed daughter, Swansea Crown Court heard. A judge said some of the treatment meted out to the youngster verged on sadistic. The abuse of the child was so disturbing that the incident was covertly filmed by a concerned neighbour. The court heard the incident took place in the garden of a house in the Swansea Valley in June . The partner of the girlaposs mother subjected the youngster to a torrent of shouting and screaming, including threatening to lock her in the freezer, before grabbing her by the ankles and holding her upside-down. During the incident the girlaposs mother threw water over the crying child. A neighbour of the couple was so alarmed by what was going on that they recorded some of the incident and later alerted the police. The couple - who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child - pleaded guilty to ill-treating a child when they appeared in the dock together. An earlier sentencing hearing had been adjourned after the judge requested a report into the psychological harm done to the child by the incident.  Karlia Lykourgou, for the male defendant, said the couple had been immature and young parents trying to cope and said her client was willing to engage with counselling or other help on offer to ensure there was no repeat. Lee Davies, on behalf of the female defendant, said his client now understood she should have tried to intervene straightaway and put to a stop to what was going on. He said the woman was trying to rebuild her relationship with her daughter and to regain her trust. Judge Paul Thomas QC said every parent has had the experience of dealing with a fractious child but what happened in the garden on the day in question had been bullying, hectoring, demeaning, and heartless behaviour which had verged on sadistic.  He said he thought the male defendant had been enjoying a power-kick in the way he had treated the child. Judge Thomas said that far from stopping what was going on, the female defendant had thrown water over the girl when it must have been apparent she was very distressed.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit the royal family earlier this year. But there were warnings signs of their shock move and the Queen knew something was amiss before Christmas, according to a report this evening.The revelations come on the eve of a bombshell biography of the couple called aposFinding Freedomapos which is set to be serialized this weekend. A new report claims that in November  Her Majesty had not heard whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their newborn son Archie would be spending Christmas at Sandringham and she decided to give them a call at Frogmore Cottage.The decision broke with tradition as ordinarily it is for the younger Royals to phone “Granny”.But the -year-old wanted to get to the bottom of what was happening after hearing tales of apostantrumsapos ever since the couple got married at Windsor Castle in , reports The .  However, the Queen did not get the answer she wanted and instead days later she learnt the couple were not coming for Christmas but on a six-week sabbatical to Canada to “work out their future”.It was during this time they reportedly plotted their way out of the Royal Family and within weeks, on January , it was announced that Harry and Meghan would be taking a new direction as royals. While their decision had been made, Harry reportedly wanted to speak with The Queen and Prince Charles - his grandmother and father - on the phone but officials persudaded him instead to write to them.  Extracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, are expected to reveal - Harry’s anger predominantly lay with what his mother famously described as the palace’s “men in grey suits” - rather than his own royal relatives. A source said: The palace approach would always be - how did we do it last time  He wanted to do things dferently and I think Meghan was the catalyst for him but also gave him the confidence which he lacked to change things.” "},{"url":null,"title":"neighbour blocks rivals car scaffolding","story":"NewsNeighbour blocks rivals car in with scaffolding as parking row eruptsInspector Darren Taylor, of Mid Sussex Police, who shared pictures of the incident, said he had never before seen a parking row escalate to the point where someone used scaffolding to block a vehicleShareCommentsByChris DyerMatthew Dresch:,  JUL NewsA neighbour blocked in a car with scaffolding over a parking dispute \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

During the episode, viewers are taken on a roller coaster ride as they watch the project cause a great amount of stress for all those involved - and one of the builders tragically dies before he can see the completed efforts of his labour. Harry and Briony Anscombe were the couple with visions of creating a structure similar to A James Speyeraposs Ben Rose House featured in Ferris Bueller - despite never having seen the actual house before. Presenter Kevin McCloud spent time with the pair, learning how they had moved out of London  months earlier and now wanted to set down their roots in Cornwall and build a dream pad. The project, which took place on the site of a former dairy farm, ended up taking longer than theyaposd hoped and the team ended up taking a number of gambles. One big blow came early on in the episode when McCloud revealed that their budget of £, wouldnapost give them a proper replica of the film house - theyaposd need to double their moneythat was what they truly wanted.  Despite this, Harry and builders Ken and Mark, decided they would carry on, making some changes to the plan, meaning the end result wouldnapost be quite the same as the house which a Ferrari famously crashed through the windows of. However the set backs kept on coming, with the Beast from the East causing them trouble and a wrong measurement setting their schedule back weeks. But the worst was yet to happen. As the construction work continued, the team arrived on site one morning to discover that Ken Pearce, one of the builders, had died suddenly in his sleep. He was always so patient with us, we asked stupid questions every day and he’d put up with it and teach us in his charming Cornish way, said Harry. He wasnapost just a builder he was a friend of the family too.  Fourteen months after they started, the house, called Natural Bridges, was completed and a memorial stone with the words Built , Ken Pearce was installed outside the property as a tribute to their friend. The finished build featured some noticeable dferences from the Ferris Bueller house - the most obvious of which is that it is made from less glass and instead has more walls in the form of Siberian larch cladding. Itaposs also bigger than the movie home. The entire project set the couple back £, in the end, but they definitely thought it was worth it. Speaking about the house, Harry said: Speyer was pure glass and perhaps a bit impractical, but it inspired us, and this is our version.

But one mum who got creative to jokingly fashion a face mask of her own has seen it hailed the aposbest invention everapos - by incorporating a handy flap giving easy access to wine. At this point please note that, although a wine flap would be a fantastic addition, it was done simply to give people a laugh and should not be copied for genuine use. Sorry. Emily Rumbold attached elastic straps to an empty packet of wet wipes and shared an hilarious video of herself opening the plastic flap on the front and taking a sip of wine before closing it again.The -year-old from Australia used packaging from Aldi and shared her invention in a Facebook group dedicated to the supermarket, where it went down a storm with other members.She also uploaded it to TikTok with the caption: Doing my bit to stop the spread, as it racked up thousand of views on social media.One viewer said: Omg this is the best invention ever no joke. A second wrote: This is exactly what I need, as another commented: Best idea out there!!

A number of amphibious armoured personnel carriers suddenly rolled on to the beach interrupting the tranquility of the Caspian Sea. Footage from the city of Kaspiysk shows the stunned daytrippers suddenly in the middle of a naval exercise. And even children who had been splashing about in the surf, were ordered out of the sea. The forces were rehearsing for one of seven major shows of strength across Russia on Sunday marking Navy Day, with many naval vessels visible out at sea.Some  ships, support vessels and amphibious personnel carriers like the × wheeled BTR- will take part in the display at Kaspiysk. Protesters hit out at the arrival of the armoured carriers as families were on the beach at the time. A woman said: The water is already contaminated. The military show would only worsen the pollution.  “Russia can only show its power and doesnapost care about people and the planet,” she said. Another mother argued that the children were delighted at seeing the navy vehicles and the sailors. She added: Parents had been warned in advance to take their children out of the sea.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/PA-54645594-832x564.jpg ","title":"back to school final decision to be made at the end of the month","story":"The final decision on whether children willto school in August #as normal# will be made next week, the education secretary has said.Giving a virtual update to Parliament, John Swinney said a further announcement and guidance will be published on July  confirming when primary and secondary school pupils canto classrooms.He also announced that half of the £ million in funding announced earlier in the summer will be ring-fenced for the recruitment of  teachers and more than  additional support staff.However, Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said that amounted to less than half-a-teacher per school in Scotland and questioned why a recruitment announcement was not being made until weeks before pupils .Education bodies welcomed the ring-fencing announcement in general, with the Scottish Children#s Services Coalition calling for a tailored plan for children with additional support needs .Pupils ing to school buildings will not be expected to wear masks, with the Scottish Government saying the #evidence# showed they were not needed for younger people.School transport vehicles, including hired buses, will be seen as #an extension of the school estate#, meaning pupils travelling to school will not be required to social distance.Primary pupils will not be required to socially distance, but older pupils may because of #unclear# evidence on transmission.Mr Swinney said: #I want to express my appreciation to parents and carers for their support to young people, to the teaching and wider workforce across Scotland for their efforts to sustain education and to children and young people for their resilience during this dficult period.#All of the school workforce have a crucial role to play in our education recovery mission, and it is vital that they are supported to do so.#The ring-fenced £ million funding to recruit more teachers and support staff will enable schools to intensy support for children and young people as theyto full time face-to-face education and help to mitigate for learning loss.#The final numbers will be dependent on the precise mix of staff recruited and the needs of children and young people.#The £ million funding recognises the extremely valuable work of our school cleaners, facilities management and school transport staff, who are essential to the successful delivery of education in Scotland and to whom I want to pay tribute today.#I also mentioned in my statement on the June  that we would be seeking the assistance of the youth work sector in supporting those families and communities who need it most.All of the school workforce have a crucial role to play in our education recovery mission, and it is vital that they are supported to do so.#John Swinney#The sector will receive £ million of investment because it has continued to support and engage children and young people throughout the pandemic, including using digital technology and outreach work to mitigate the impact of Covid- on children and young people’s mental health, learning and development.#While this funding should provide local authorities with the assurance they require to progress plans immediately, we will continue to work with COSLA to understand the additional costs associated with the school re-opening guidance that each local authority is facing, and how these can be addressed alongside any loss of learning.#We are currently developing guidance, with our partners in the ERG, on health mitigation and precautions that will be in place to allow schools to fully re-open in August and a final decision on school re-opening will be announced on July .#Labour#s Iain Gray said councils and local authorities deserved more support and more notice.He added: #Schools are due to open just over two weeks. Yet we still have no final decision, councils still don#t actually have the resources they need and guidance on risk reduction is still being written.#Government has never had a route map for theof schools, and they still don’t – they still look asthey are making this up at the last minute. The additional teachers announced today amount to less than half a staff member per school and councils have two weeks to recruit them.#Hundreds, perhaps thousands of newly qualied teachers, probationer teachers, supply teachers and retired teachers who all want to help get our schools back still cannot get a job. Surely we need every available qualied teacher we can #How ready are we really  How many additional teachers have actually been recruited  What proportion of school buildings have actually risk assessed for pupils’   As for mitigation, we are all, all of us over the age five, wearing face coverings in shops – can it really be the case that nobody is to wear them in schools #A spokesperson for the Scottish Children’s Services Coalition said: #We welcome the recruitment of new teachers and additional support staff to help cope with the new demands of Coronavirus when childrento school next month.#For those with additional support needs, the impact of ing to school will prove particularly disruptive but we need to go beyond the recruitment of additional support staff alone, which of course helps greatly. What is required is a tailored transition plan so those with ASN get the smoothest possibleto school.#This requires every teacher or member of staff looking at the inidual child, their circumstances and needs and making sure theirto school is as seamless as possible#That inidualised approach might mean going back to school early, having a little more time to figure out what classroom spaces look like or might be about teaching strategies and thinking about how to engage the children.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.53543935-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.53543935-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.53543935-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.53543935-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee born midfielder charlie adam reveals he has tested positive for coronavirus","story":"Dundee-born Scotland international Charlie Adam has revealed he has tested positive for coronavirus.The -year-old midfielder, who is currently at Reading, has spoken of his dismay after finding out the test results.Adam, a lelong Dundee FC fan, wrote on Twitter: “Very frustrating ending to the season for me, tested positive for Covid- which kept me out for ten days and three games despite two negative test results  hours after the positive.“Want to say a big thanks to all the Reading fans for all their support this season.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There#s barely been a spare minute.#But I#m not complaining because we#re doing our bit to make sure football and every other business s in a safe manner throughout.#We manufacture revolutionary anti-viral and sanitising products for decontaminating and sanitising all football training equipment like balls, markers, poles, goals etc.“The product range we have is also fantastic for inside and outside the stadium – changing rooms, showers, offices team coaches and mini buses.#Nobody ever thought we would have to take such steps but it#s the reality now and we can#t be too careful.#The clubs I speak to are so supportive. They realise the necessity of it all and are taking every step required to make everyone safe.#It works from the Premiership right down the isions, including junior and amateur isions to boys and girls club football.#Soutar has suffered like everyone  in the absence of any competitive action since mid-March but the ex-Ross County ace is counting down the days to next Saturday#s top-flight curtain-raiser.He added: #Having retired after  years playing football I#ve now found a job I love.#It#s great to be able to use my knowledge and experience from both careers to help clubs at this time.#This is going to be the #new norm’. It will take time to adapt and I can help with that.#Every player, manager, coach and supporter has found the last few months so hard without football.#We#re all in the same boat as we love football. It#s what we#ve been brought up on and it#s what we live for at weekends.#So I#m just glad to be playing my own part in helping get things back up and running.#It#s still an exciting time even though it#s going to be dferent.“From my point of view, I would to see Dundee back in the Premiership at the end of this campaign – in a safe way of course.#GEORGE CRAN: Wage cut agreement a big step for Dundee but still a long road ahead\" title\"#GEORGE CRAN: Wage cut agreement a big step for Dundee but still a long road ahead# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp george-cran-wage-cut-agreement-a-big-step embed # secretXnNEgxDZVD\" data-secret\"XnNEgxDZVD\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"when is two metres not two metres","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGovernment coronavirus guidelines have caught the attention of our artistic contributor Ann Thomas.The UK and Scottish governments have been under pressure to review the recommended two-metre social distancing rule to allow more businesses to re-open sensibly.Scientic advisers, however, say a one metre separation carries a much greater risk of coronavirus transmission than being two metres apart.As the debate rumbles on, Ann has her own take on matters.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

with zero-gravity, Lloyd, , has spent the last  years writing books for children, inspired by nature and the history of the world beyond humans.Discussing his  release, Humanimal, Lloyd said: \"Children are born with an instinct, an intuition that all living things are connected and that theyre part of an ecosystem.\"This is the way we are naturally but society and culture tend to beat that out of us ndash they tell us were more intelligent.\"The point of the book is to try to preserve, for children, this reality of interconnectivity, and to give them some protection to whats

mindset as a species and survive.\"As this is the message he is keen to share, Humanimaland Lloyds other works are not designed to act as an \"A to Z encyclopaedia\" of information, but rather tell the planets natural history away from the impact of humanity.\"All my books are meant for adults as well as children,\" said Lloyd. ldquoTheyre illustrated and designed in a way that makes adults want to buy them for children and I hope children want to share them with adults.\"Its a book, its a story, its something to be discussed, its something to be read out loud, its something to be looked at

believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd

where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise.

This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet.

But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

spin-offs from the  film of the same name - we have followed the two loveable rogues as they get themselves into all sorts of sticky situations.Particularly memorable storylines include the teenagers attempt to steal a giant tuna fish from the market in series one, and when they got expelled after stripping off in the classroom and peeing on Principal Walshs leg in series two.Now were getting a series three, in which we see the lads trying to make their way as young adults, with yet more questionable methods of making some money, all while Jock navigates being a new dad.One things for sure things wont go smoothly.Here, we chat to Walley and Murphy, plus Hilary Rose - who plays Conors stressed-out but loving mum, Mairead - to find out more.NEW CHAPTERIts an unconventional family set-up in The Young Offenders, which is set and filmed in Cork.A heart-warming episode in series one saw widower Maireadbecome a foster mum to Jock - whose mum is also dead - after he escapes his abusive, alcoholic dad.At the end of series two, Jocks girlfriend Siobhan - whose dad happens to be Principal Walsh, who is far from the biggest fan of Jock and Conor - gave birth to baby Star .The new addition to the family means Principal Walsh and his we Orla - whose other daughter Linda is going out with Conor - now have to engage more with Mairead, which hasnt always gone well in the past.\"Season three was interesting from a character point of view because Mairead really cuts loose and, at some stages, the lads are telling her to calm down!\" follows Rose, whos also from Cork, and married Peter Foott - who created The Young Offenders - since .As for the love story between her and Sergeant Healy, she teases \"season three kinda continues that on-again, off-again, will they, wont they vibe\".The main storyline for series two is how Jock is adjusting to everyday le with baby Star.\"Conor and Jock are still getting into their sticky situations but now theres just a baby there as well,\" reveals Walley.\"I think its just a major sht in their lives and theyre just trying to figure it out all together.\"PARENTING LESSONSTwins Nola and Penny Richardson shared the role of Star, and Walley says the babies were \"incredible\".\"I want one!\" exclaims Murphy, before quickly adding \"not right now\".Rose chimes in at this point, saying she has told the boys they are always welcome to babysit her kids .\"Theyre both amazing babysitters, but there was a time when Jake was very young where they bought him a nerf gun,\" she recalls, which sets them all off laughing, with her on-screen sons looking a little sheepish.\"I dunno, we were buying toys and we were like, This is what kids that age like!\" reasons Walley.\"There was some force off ityou shot it,\" he concedes. \"Theyre heavy-duty.\"\"That was a real Conor and Jock moment for the two of us,\" admits Murphy.Having Penny and Nola on set this series was definitely a learning curve for the young actors.\"I was terried of holding babies for fear I dropped them,\" confides Walley. \"By the end of the shoot, I just was inseparable.\"MEMORABLE MOMENTSAccording to Murphy, \"theres not a street in Cork city that we havent filmed on\".\"The Cork people are so proud of the show.\"Having crowds watching them film was something they \"had to get used to pretty quick.\"\"There was a great photo in the paper a few years ago, of us making the film there are about  people in the crew, no-ones watching us filming,\" notes Murphy.\"And then there was a photo of us making season , and there were just crowds of people watching.\"It was good, it was like doing a play every day, whenever we were filming outside in the city.\"One of the new episodes sees Jock, Conor and Mairead take a trip to Dublin.Whilst filming on a road in the Irish capital city, they reveal they were pulled over by Leo Varadkars entourage as he was driving past them in an unmarked executive car.The Irish politician was taoiseach at the time .\"There was a camera in the back seat, and we were mid-scene and we were like, What does this guy want  Were filming!\" says Rose.\"And eventually Alex put down the passenger window and was like Hey!, and next thing Leo Varadkar leaned forward!\"\"His driver was like, Great show!\" recalls Murphy. \"We were like, Do you like it [to Varadkar] And he went, I havent seen it!\"\"But he did say, Ive heard its great\", adds Rose.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTThe biggest thing Rose has taken away from making The Young Offenders is the amazing relationships theyve formed with cast and crew .\"Its about getting the job done and doing the best that you can, but you have to remember as well, for actors, were really vulnerable in front of all the crew, so you kinda put your trust in them,\" she elaborates.\"If were doing emotional scenes, theyre witnessing it, theyre trying to support you.\"As for future series, Murphy points out the only issue could be that he and Walley dont exactly look  anymore.\"At some points in the script, Jock will go, We cant do that, were only , and we were like, Can we just not mention our age \" he continues, chuckling.\"As long as we look young, I guess well see what happens.

In one sense, everyonersquos property is off limits without permission, as it is anywhere . Unless, that is, yoursquore an apple-scrumping child ndash and which of us has never been  At this stage of le a garden with fruit trees is excellent training for a career in the SAS ndash get in, achieve mission and scarper without trace or casualties. Part of the allure of these raids, as I recall, is not just the trepidation of trespassing, but of taking forbidden fruit. Usually we gathered the unripe apples and stone-hard pears as ammunition for our long-running battles, rather than as a source of vitamin C. If kids ever clamber over the fence for our apples, theyrsquod be more than welcome. If they could also pick the crab apples and turn them into jam that would be appreciated.Many aspects of le are very dferent this summer from last, but one thing has not changed. Regardless of the lurgy, fruit is ripening fast on bushes and trees the high season of berries is upon us. One of the most vivid memories of our first August here was sitting in a friendrsquos summerhouse and suddenly seeing three folk emerging from the far end of their garden. Each was clutching a bowl heaped with jewel-like fruits, and as they passed it was aswersquod glimpsed the three Magi.A few days ago, we were invited into the same garden, to help ourselves to raspberries. It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew. Being allowed access to this most beautul, out of the way corner reminds me a little of The Secret Garden. That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense.

Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Around one third of our children are overweight or obese. % of adults are considered overweight, with % classed as obese. Time and pounds roll on together, with an astonishing % of those between  and  classed as overweight.Drastic action was taken to avoid overwhelming the NHS with Covid cases. Obesity threatens to do the same, swallowing up essential resources. The overweight should not be at the back of the queue for surgery, but should still be accountable for their choices and consequences.Early intervention and prevention are always better and cheaper than cure. Developing a healthy lestyle and daily exercise, should be more central to the school curriculum. Oh, how we laughed at those old newsreels of Japanese workers doing morning exercises at their desks and machines. Whorsquos laughing now, when Japan has the worldrsquos healthiest elderly population  Why not incentivise Scottish employers to provide time for daily exercise in offices and factories  Through GPs, at risk iniduals can be targeted, supported and monitored. Despite the Covid track and trace fiasco, phone apps could still be useful, although electronic tagging of the overweight may be a bridge too far.Re-opening pubs and fast food outlets before gyms and indoor sports facilities sent out the wrong message. Surely, a work out or a game of squash in a controlled environment is less of a health risk than a burger washed down by six pints of lager. The government needs to get on message. Otherwise, a resurgence of Covid, combined with increasing levels of obesity, and the fat will be well and truly in the fire.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Though curiously, none of this Moscow gold ever found its way into my bank account. Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state. After all, it is widely assumed to have been conducting assassinations on UK soil using some of the most toxic agents known. This was against former KGB spies Alexander Litvinov and Sergei Skripal. These were terrorist actions and clearly a priority for the UKrsquos intelligence and security forces.But social media influencing is a rather dferent kettle of spooks. What I mainly recall from  were the widespread claims of vote-rigging and dirty tricks, not by the Kremlin but by MI. Many SNP supporters on Twitter believe the Alex Salmond sex case was orchestrated by the UK secret service.If, as the ISC committee recommended yesterday, MI spooks should now be actively investigating and judging social media posts during election campaigns, then yet more mistrust and paranoia will assuredly be the result. Why so sure  Because they are already doing this.It was revealed in  that the Institute for Statecraft, and its protege the Integrity Initiative, funded by the UK Foreign Office, was already battling Vladimir Putinrsquos social media meddling from the improbable location of a disused mill in Fe. The Integrity Initiative is all about countering ldquodisinformation and malign influence from Russia, which increasingly originates online.However, these hapless hacktivists strayed disastrously into domestic politics. The Integrity Initiative had to apologise to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for retweeting messages suggesting that he was one of Mr Putinrsquos ldquouseful idiots. Itrsquos not clear which of the institutersquos , tweets were alleging this, but we can guess.Ms Cadwalladr had claimed in  that senior members of the Labour Party including Jeremy Corbynrsquos communications director, Seumas Milne, were Russian patsies. ldquoMilnersquos support of Russia is like Faragersquos, she tweeted in December . ldquoTherersquos nothing hidden. Itrsquos completely overt.This is the problem with trying to fight a propaganda war on social media. Even more than conventional spying it is a hall of mirrors. Paranoia feeds paranoia. In calling for the intelligence services to start investigating election campaigns, the ISC committee is asking for something the spooks dearly want to avoid.Take Labourrsquos ldquoNHS for sale dossier, which became a major story in the  General Election campaign. This first appeared on the Reddit website. That websitersquos own security analysts claimed that, while the documents on Britainrsquos trade negotiations with the US were genuine, they were put into the public domain by Russian sources.Do we seriously want MI judging the veracity and origins of every election issue  Arguably, yesterdayrsquos ISC report was itself an exercise in political propaganda serving to taint the  referendum with Russian involvement. Yet there is precisely no evidence, compelling or otherwise, that this had any impact on the result. Keep spooks out of politics.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Police clearly fear a large crowd of admirers will turn up, breaking Covid- guidelines. It would be like Elvis when he passed through Prestwick, but with a blimpish old Etonian in place of a rock and roll prince.Can it really be a year since Mr Johnson stood in a sun-dappled Downing Street and, with a mob of bellowing well-wishers outside the gates, promised to confound ldquothe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters who said he would not get Brexit done He also promised to make the streets safer, ensure no-one had to wait weeks to see a GP, and tackle the crisis in social care. ldquoNever mind the backstop, said the new Prime Minister using the jargon of the time, ldquothe buck stops here.He certainly tried to fulfil many of those pledges, albeit in unconventional ways. The streets were safer because they were empty. No-one could see a GP because surgeries were closed. As for social care, it had a whole other crisis to worry about. The story of Mr Johnsonrsquos first year in power is inescapably the story of Covid-. Everything  is secondary, even Brexit, crucial as its success, or otherwise, is to the future of the country. Any judgment on his first year in office is necessarily a verdict on how he dealt with the virus crisis.: Remainers need to move on says PMThough Mr Johnson would prefer to wait for the official inquiry, public opinion is way ahead of him. In a poll last week for the Sun on Sunday,  per cent of respondents thought he was doing well in his job, compared to % for Chancellor Rishi Sunak and % for the newly installed Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.The new Commons double act of Johnson and Starmer was in action again yesterday at the last PMQs before the summer recess. These contests have settled down to a familiar routine in which prime ministerial bluster meets lawyerly formality. Neither man will be truly tested until the Commons, like everything , is back to normal, or the ldquonew normal, whatever and whenever that might be.If there is one word which sums up Mr Johnsonrsquos response to the crisis it is ldquoslow. Slow to impose a lockdown. Slow to build up testing capacity. Slow in making sure there was enough personal protective equipment for the front line staff who needed it desperately. Slow to pick up on the crisis in care homes.Since the PM, like the rest of us, was new to the crisis he was given an enormous amount of leeway. Normal business from opposition parties was suspended. The media were onside. He had been an unlucky premier, dreadfully so, but what was political ill fortune when so many people were losing loved ones  Then he fell ill, eventually ending up in intensive care. The shock, and the get well soon messages, were genuine.Whatever goodwill he built up was soon squandered by his refusal to sack his chief aide, Dominic Cummings, for driving to Durham, and beyond, during lockdown. He failed that test of leadership, just as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon neglected to show the door immediately to her chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, on learning of her double lockdown breach. On his way into Number , Mr Johnson said politicians should never forget that the people are the bosses. Well, the people wanted Mr Cummings gone, yet he remains.As for the rest of Mr Johnsonrsquos first year, it was a mixed bag. The proroguing of Parliament and the subsequent defeat in the Supreme Court would be a stain on any PMrsquos reputation.The General Election that followed was a triumph for the party, with hitherto-Labour seats falling to the Conservatives. How much that was due to votersrsquo impatience over Brexit, and how much to then Labour leader Jeremy Corbynrsquos general uselessness, depends on the observer.: Labour will pay damages to whistleblowersThen we come to Scotland, which stands in the same place it did when Mr Johnson became Prime Minister ndash stuck in the middle between the status quo and independence. Scotland has not appeared to figure much in the PMrsquos calculations this past year, though he has had other things on his mind. That is about to change we are told, hence his visit to Scotland today.Thereafter Scotland is to be love bombed by Downing Street, with ministers encouraged to follow the PM north to talk up the benefits of the Union, particularly in the current crisis.This, Mr Johnson believes, will tackle increasing support for independence in the polls and drive it downwards, just in time for the next Scottish Parliament elections. That is the theory, in any case.The reality may be very dferent. Telling Scotland how much better off it is in the Union by talking up how much money has flowed from Westminster suggests those billions are in the form of grants and do not have to be repaid. In fact, Scottish taxpayers, in common with taxpayers in the rest of the UK, will be the ones eventually paying the bills Mr Johnson is running up. To adapt a phrase from a former Chancellor, we are all in this mess together.Mention of George Osborne brings us to the reason Mr Johnson will get in and out of Scotland today ashis trousers were on fire. When it comes to the Conservatives, Scotlandrsquos memory goes back much further than a year. In the manner of Back to the Future, shall we turn the clock  years to the Coalition Government and the start of austerity  Or -plus years to Mrs Thatcher and all that came after  Earlier Scotlandrsquos problem with the Conservatives has nothing to do with not understanding them.

Seatbelts and vaccines are fully tested and usage policies are based on sound scientic evidence. However, the policy for mandatory usage of \"cloth face masks coverings\" seems to be based on circumstantial assumptions, papers which have not been peer reviewed, but yet are quoted by the media as being factual and definite.This issue appears to be a red herring in the Covid- fight and as Orwell said about Second World War gas masks, \"simply a symbol of national solidarity\". Only N respiratory masks are of any help in the prevention of respiratory disease, as Professor Jason Leitch correctly advised at the start of this crisis. The only thing that has changed is Prof Leitchs advice based on \"some evidence\". However, \"some evidence\" has not been circulated, and there is no consensus across the scientic or global community on this subject, due to the lack of evidence.Its easier to support something when presented with actual evidence and that is the obvious issue here. To date there appears to be only one validated test, which is referenced in this current WHO guidance to healthcare and community workers of June : \"In the context of severe medical mask shortage, face shields may be considered as an alternative. The use of cloth masksas an alternative to medical masks is not considered appropriate for protection of health workers based on limited available evidence. One study that evaluated the use of cloth masks in a health care facility found that health care workers using cotton cloth masks were at increased risk of influenza-like illness compared with those who wore medical masks.\"However, the WHO advice for the public, issued on the same date, recommends that the public should wear them. Why  The WHO was forced by political interference to amend its advice. The WHO has not performed its duty from the start of this outbreak, and that is a huge issue. Its about time that the media took notice of these things and actually gained corroborative evidence instead of jumping on the bandwagon in these desperate times.I believe this to be a political judgment, not a scientic one, done this to try to appear asthey are doing something, and provide someconfidence to the population.

The governmentrsquos science advisers are repeating the mistakes of the BSE crisis ndash confusing a lack of evidence of risk or benefit for a lack of risk or benefit altogether.She said behavioural scientist, Peter Lunn, told her that, in his experience, scientists tend to be more strident in communicating evidencethey know it will chime with what politicians want to hear.ldquoThis is why there needs to be more transparency about the processes through which scientic advice feeds into decision making.The Virginia Blackburn said there are optimistic signs right now - lockdown is easing, restaurants are opening and there are real hopes of a vaccine.ldquoBut not for some people, [there arenrsquot], she said. ldquoNever one to fail to turn a drama into a crisis, there are some naysayers out there who are so pessimistic we might all just as wellto bed, draw a duvet over our head and stay there until Armageddon.She cited Laurie Garrett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on Ebola in , and said this week that le will never, ever be the same again.ldquoThere is no normal, she said. ldquoThis is the new reality.

Tai Frasier is Harriet Smith Elton is Mr Elton the vicar.It was easy to predict Emmas next move because isnt she just like Cher and, well, after  years of kinship I know exactly what Cher would do next.The film Clueless is  this year, and we are early for the celebration here due to belated UK release dates. In the US the film was screened from the July, hence a glut of \"where are the cast now \" pieces and interviews with its star, Alicia Silverstone.In the UK Clueless was released in the October, but let me creep in ahead of time with a little love letter to the movie.Watching the film was one of those seminal adolescent moments that floats around with you permanently just tickling your subconscious. It isnt the movie, only, that makes it seminal but the entire experience of the movie.I remember where I saw it, I remember who I was with, what snacks we ate and that it was the first time I was allowed to a film with a friend and without an adult chaperone. Heady times.Babe was released that year and also Pocahontas but it is Clueless that stays with me, for viewing it meant a step towards that then much desired and now much resented state of being grown up.Looking back at the headlines of  creates a bleak picture. Here, Ronnie Kray and Fred West died. A gripped nation followed the OJ Simpson trial until the not guilty verdict. The Queen urged Charles and Diana to file for orce.One bright spot seems to have been the Queen Mothers successful hip operation.As a pre-teen all this passed me by but it does make sense, against a glum backdrop, that a bright film set in bright sunshine with a sunshine protagonist would have captured positive reviews.Our heroine Cher is manipulative, she is shallow, she is ignorant. But shes relentlessly, eternally optimistic. She nicely manipulative, theres a kindness in it. She doesnt know how to be anything  but sunny.The film is very much a snapshot of a Calornian high school at a specic time and place and yet it is also curiously timeless. Its writer, Amy Heckerling, created her own teenage slang while the films costume designer Mona May invented a unique style for the films main stars, meaning that, while it is definitively teenage, it is not quite bound to a particular era.As a pre-teen it seemed entirely reasonable to me that -year-olds would be cruising around in Jeeps, using credit cards and dating college guys. It was, ironically, aspirational and part of a wider love affair with American high school le presented also in Sweet Valley High books.Everyone beautul, everyone glamorous, romance and takeaway iced coffees around every corner.The fashions were one link to acting out our Lanarkshire version of Calornia valley girl le. We bought plaid mini skirts and wore them with knee high socks, the stupid things would never stay up the way they stayed up on Cher and her best friend Dionne.We wore spaghetti-strap vests over white t-shirts. We did not wear original Alaiumla .At the time of its release, the Hollywood Reporter called Clueless, \"plotless and borderline brainless\" adding, \"But that wont stop the Paramount release from cashing in substantially with the teenage and young adult crowd.\"The first of that review is unfair - Cher may be styled as an airhead but she is not stupid, shes ignorant and these two are quite dferent. The dialogue is smart and snappy - anything but brainless and only someone whos forgotten their teenage agonies could call it anything . She is entirely responsible for herself in an admirable way. Her report card grades, for example, are ldquoa jumping-off point to start negotiations.The second is spot on - it did cash in. It did cash in - with a TV series following quickly thereafter, books, merchandise - and ironically so. Because Clueless, of course, subverts the Hollywood makeover trope by giving the beautul girl, the one others aspire to look like, an internal makeover.She realises, twee as it may be, that money and materialism are not what will give her a meaningful le. Only education and charity will. If only someone had told us we were entirely missing the central moral premise of the movie as we, for the eight millionth time that day, pulled up our knee socks and tucked down our miniskirts.Clueless was a satirical critique of empty, spoiled teenage consumerism - and it made me want to buy things.On Monday my lockdown film club had a th anniversary celebratory viewing of Clueless. Its anxiety-inducing, to re-watch something that exists as a perfect specimen in the memory. What , like Friends, another nostalgic slice of s culture, it has aged badly. Whatthe central and adored characters are actually, like Ross, deeply unlikeable  Whatthe humour relies on sexist and homophobic jokes Ah, but relief. Its still perfect. Its still fresh and witty and thoroughly enjoyable.And now,  years on, in a pandemic when -year-olds are striking against climate change as much as they hanging out at the mall when the US president has made America somewhere you feel pity for, not envy of, its the perfect time for curling up with a character built of radiant optimism.Something to give a sense of control, Cher might say, in a world full of chaos.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

find it a little lonely at times.A recent trip there found the cabin vandalised and litter left by wild campers, she said.Elise said: ldquoThe island was put on the sale for poundK which we thought

is now a closing date of August  which means we need to raise double the original amount in three weeks.ldquoWhatever amount of money we receive, we will make an offer.She said the family had gone for

They also released Broich Single Estate ndash a limited edition gin featuring tea grown right here in Scotland.Why tea  Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT. The founders used their recent time in lockdown to completely refresh their website and provide a nice range of cocktail suggestions too!

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We want to help them keep it up.“These survey results and the enthusiastic response to the Make Space for Nature campaign gives us confidence that Scotland is well placed to reverse the decline in ersity of animal and plant species in Scotland. As the need for nature is ever more apparent, the way Scotland recovers from COVID- could be one important way we secure a nature rich future for generations to come.”SNH is keen to encourage and support people to develop their interest, learn more and get involved in nature.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

They will consider the level of compliance by August  and could then decide on steps around enforcement.But there was confusion as the Health Minister was forced to backtrack on a statement that claimed a decision on compulsory coverings had already been taken.In other developments on Thursday:The Executive agreed on an indicative date of August  for the reopening of #wet pubs#.Spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor sporting venues where the operator can control access and ensure adherence to social distancing.The number of people from dferent households permitted to gather in a private home is now .Facilities such as bowling alleys and swimming pools can open from FridayHealth officials revealed a coronavirus contact tracing app for Northern Ireland will be launched next week.And ministers have updated advice for people heading abroad.Guidance which had said only to travel overseasit is essential has been dropped. Instead people are urged to carefully consider your holiday and travel options, in light of the continuing Covid- threat.The issue sparked a row after Alliance health spokeswoman Paula Bradshaw said her family would travel to Italy for a holiday this weekend. Hours after defending her plans, the South Belfast MLA cancelled the trip.On Thursday night she refused to be drawn on whether she would reconsider, saying it was a private matter.After days of confusion around holidays, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill are seeking a special summit including the British and Irish Governments to address discord over Covid- travel restrictions. Deputy First Minister Ms O#Neill admitted: The position is confusing for people, it is a mess across the island.The Executive on Thursday night faced fresh claims of mixed messaging - this time on face coverings.At .pm a statement was released from Mr Swann welcoming the Executive#s decision to make the wearing of face coverings mandatory in shops. It said the rule would take effect on a phased basis from August , with a lead-in periodwill see legal enforcement of the measure beginning on August .But  minutes later a second statement was issued, removing any reference to mandatory rules.Mr Swann, in his new statement, said the initial emphasis will be on education and encouragement.There had been calls for the Executive to make face masks here compulsory, after similar moves by England, Scotland and the Republic.But retail bodies said they feared making coverings mandatory would deter shoppers.On Thursday the Executive agreed to give itself the power to make face coverings mandatory in some indoor settings including shops. But the law will not be enforced until August  - and only thentake-up of masks is low. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, and Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, had said they were opposed to face coverings becoming mandatory. In a joint statement they welcomed the Executive#s decision, adding: We appreciate that ministers have listened to concerns expressed from both of our organisations and have decided to adopt an initial voluntary approach to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops. The decision will allow retailers time to prepare properly and also let the Executive develop guidance, better inform everyone of the benefits of wearing face coverings and educate us all on how to use coverings correctly.Meanwhile, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, welcomed news of an indicative opening date of August  for wet pubs. He said: These pubs are at the heart of our local communities and have experienced signicant financial dficulties since closure in March.It has also been confirmed a Covid- tracing app will be launched next week. Department of Health chief digital information officer Dan West told the Stormont health committee it would be called Stop Covid NI. Use of the app will be voluntary and it will not collect identiable information, he added. Should someone receive a positive test they will receive a unique code texted to their phone. Once the user gives permissions it will release data from the phone to a server so close contacts can be traced, he added.Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app. The Republic#s app launched earlier this month.Meanwhile, eight new cases of Covid- have been recorded here, the Department of Health confirmed. No further deaths were recorded in the past  hours and the death toll from the virus remains at , based on the department#s figures, which cover mainly hospital fatalities.

Yesterday it repeated its position that it would not ulge specic details about cluster outbreaks. There have been  clusters here since the end of May.Sean McKeever, from Unite, which is not the Ballymena#s site recognised trade union but does have members there, said the PHA should implement testing of Moy Park employees for a -day period. We cover the rest of the Moy Park sites and my concern would be the health and safety of all workers on that site, he told the Belfast .I think that every worker should be tested on site over the next  days to make sure it is eradicated.Moy Park has said that it is facilitating testing employees and their households at local test centres.Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of health committee, said it highlighted the need for greater preventative measures for the food manufacturing sector, adding Stormont must show more forthright action.We have seen instances where in the UK and Ireland of tens of cases being linked to inidual meat factories, and literally thousands of confirmed cases were linked to a single plant in Gutersloh in Germany, she said.It is completely obvious that meat factories represent a serious risk.This outbreak suggests that not enough has been done by the relevant ministers to ensure staff safely in meat factories.Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern IrelandFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandSplit in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionRUC widow Fiona Willis on defiance  years after IRA bombing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#ve never done it and no one  in the house ever had an interest. He just picked it up on YouTube, watched a few videos and away he went.While Daniel remains loathe to part with any of his creations, he will be looking for a new home for at least a few of them over the next few weeks, as he plans to raffle a selection of his craftwork for Cancer Focus in memory of his Scout Leader Beverly Fisher, who died a few weeks ago.Everyone at Whitehouse Scouts loved Beverly, especially Daniel, and we thought it would be nice to do something in her memory, said Carol.Some of his works, including an NHS bear and a dragon, will be raffled off for the charity on a justgiving page we#ve set up.Daniel originally thought it would be nice to have a table to sell some of his creations at the school fair at Whitehouse Primary where he#s just about to start P, but when that was cancelled in June we were left with all the animals in the front room.He#s got attached to them all now but at least a few of them will hopefully find a new home.Daniel was quickly taken under the wing of two local wool shops, who have helped him keep the needles clicking by donating spare wool and hooks to him.The staff at The Yarn Patch in Newtownabbey and Lighthouse Yarns in Whitehead have been great in helping him out when he got stuck, but over the past couple of months his designs have become more and more elaborate. They#re thrilled to see what he#s managed to create.Those creations include Daniel#s current favourite, a one metre long red dragon. But even that is set to be surpassed with his latest project, another dragon, this time five feet long.This one#s the daddy! said Carol. He#s still doing smaller bits and pieces for his school friends and I know the school are looking forward to seeing the full range when he gets to go back there next month.In the meantime, he#s now started to create his own designs. He has no problem following the videos online and the patterns, but he#s now in extreme crochet territory.He#s had plenty of time on his hands to be creative, said Carol. His dad is an electrical engineer and has been working for the health service, so he#s been extremely busy these past few months. I#ve been working at home as a marketing consultant, so it#s been brilliant for Daniel to find a way of entertaining himself. He just get to work in the living room and the bonus is it#s a quiet hobby too.Daniel and me both have mild asthma so we#ve been staying at home as much as possible. He#s still done his school work and also learned to ride his bike during lockdown, but he#s always anxious to get back to work on his crochet.Find out more by visiting justgiving and searching for Daniel#s Lockdown Crochet Raffle.

Now, he#s on his way back.Much to the disappointment of his legion of fans across the ide, it won#t be toto office in Stormont House. Rather, Smith will drive next week from his North Yorkshire constituency to Scotland, where he will board a ferry for a week#s holiday on our shores. Not since Mo Mowlam has a Secretary of State actually fallen for this place. I genuinely love Northern Ireland and I#m looking forward to reacquainting myself with its people, restaurants and bars, he says  enjoying a few Ulster fries and tray bakes. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith during his first visit to Northern Ireland outside the Guildhall in Londonderry FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith during his first visit to Northern Ireland outside the Guildhall in LondonderryI#d have been back far soonerit wasn#t for Covid.Smith traces his affinity for this neck of the woods to growing up in Fintry, a fantastically beautul Scottish village with a big and strong sense of community.Appointing him Secretary of State is widely regarded as the best thing Boris Johnson has ever done for Northern Ireland, and removing him the worst.Smith didn#t have a hard act to follow in the hapless Karen Bradley. It#s not just that he brokered a deal in January to restore devolution at Stormont after three years of deadlock. His whole style of doing business was dferent to his predecessors of the previous two decades.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with PM Boris Johnson, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster on the steps of Stormont earlier this year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with PM Boris Johnson, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster on the steps of Stormont earlier this yearImmediately after his appointment on July  last year, he hired two twenty-something special advisers, Ross Easton and Lilah Howson-Smith.On our first trip to Northern Ireland, Lilah mentioned how excited her mum was that we were going to a place where someone as passionate as Mo Mowlam had worked, Smith tells me. That got me thinking about the approach I wanted to take. Mo had been extremely hands-on, very direct and personable. She had focused on building relationships. I felt that the Secretary of State position could be quite activist and maybe a bit less formal than it had sometimes been.Smith first visited Northern Ireland is his childhood, when he was a junior international squash player.He came to the job knowing the DUP inside out from his two years as Theresa May#s chief whip in the House of Commons. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with DUP leader Arlene Foster and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Enniskillen for the Remembrance Sunday service in November last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer NI Secretary of State Julian Smith with DUP leader Arlene Foster and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Enniskillen for the Remembrance Sunday service in November last yearAddressing its party conference in , he had heaped praised on its MPs and said his door was always open to them. Those remarks wrongly led to him being labelled a DUP stooge.He had never met a Sinn Fein politician before becoming Secretary of State, he admits. A committed unionist, he was still determined not to be an archetypal sort of Tory just understanding one perspective. I wanted to work hard to understand them all, he says. Smith set out to build constructive relationships with nationalists. He first met Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney at a very formal event in Hillsborough Castle, where they were surrounded by their officials. As business concluded, he asked Coveney: Will we go to the pub  They sauntered down to the Hillside in the village. From that ice-breaking moment, they built a strong relationship, which paved the way for New Decade, New Approach.Smith thinks politicians perhaps don#t spend enough time having a meal, having a drink, staying that extra night to get to know the people they#re dealing with. It helpsyou#ve broken bread together, he says. It doesn#t mean that there#s full agreement on political issues, but it allows room to tease out the common ground.He put in more time in Northern Ireland than any of his predecessors. Instead of heading back to his constituency, his we and seven-year-old daughter would join him here at weekends. There were trips to the Clip #n Climb and We Are Vertigo adventure centres, and visits to local restaurants and pubs.Did he ever worry about the dissident republican threat during these trips  No, not at all, he says. There are more security issues in Northern Ireland than in any other part of the UK, but I felt completely safe with PSNI support.Uniquely for a Secretary of State, he#d tweet pictures of his leisure activities, aiming to break out of the Stormont bubble and make a connection with ordinary citizens.After the relentless, behind-the-scenes Brexit years, he says that he enjoyed the opportunity to be in a front-facing role as a Secretary of State able to drive policy.Smith lost every key Brexit vote in the Commons, but in Northern Ireland, his skills and strategising reaped signicant rewards. By publishing the text of New Decade, New Approach on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, he and Coveney effectively bounced local politicians into signing up.There were no shocks in the document, he insists, saying that much of the text had been discussed for at least a year,not longer by the DUP and Sinn Fein.Days before the deal was due to be published, he vented his frustration at the lack of progress. We#ve been effing about at this far too long, he told the politicians in front of him.Six months after the restoration of power-sharing, the gloss has well and truly worn off the Stormont executive. The fall-out from Bobby Storey#s funeral means that Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill have stopped holding joint press conferences.Smith, however, remains determinedly optimistic. Everybody needs a bit of a break over the summer, he says. Clearly, there have been some signicant ups and downs, but I hope there#ll be an opportunity to refresh and move forward in the autumn. There is no alternative to power-sharing.He stresses that it#s essential that the Executive urgently focuses on drawing up a programme for government and ensuring that the pledges made in New Decade, New Approach are delivered.He says that he found Foster and O#Neill easy to deal with and both had a good way with people. Ulster Unionist MLA Robin Swann is a very under-stated politician who is really proving himself as Health Minister, he adds. Alliance leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long, meanwhile, is extremely focused, and SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is massively dedicated.Of all Stormont#s politicians, he also singles out as noteworthy SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole and two special advisers in The Executive Office - the DUP#s Emma Little-Pengelly and Sinn Fein#s Stephen McGlade.He thinks it important that the next generation of MLAs get to know the key players in London and Dublin and build a network of relationships with those who could help them in future.Last year, MPs at Westminster voted to legalise same sex-marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland in the absence of devolution. The DUP expressed its anger at the move, but Smith thinks it was the right thing for Parliament to do. It means Northern Ireland is in a better position regarding social reform, he says. There is no longer any signicant opposition to equal marriage here, he adds. He sees abortion as more controversial, but believes it#s appropriate that rights in Northern Ireland are in line withLondon and Dublin.Smith is most proud of his role in fast-tracking legislation to compensate victims of historical institutional child abuse. The impact of his first encounter with them on becoming Secretary of State was powerful.I met this group of people, some getting on in years, who were extremely frustrated.people who had the most horrendous experiences and had been sent from pillar to post, he says.The impact these crimes had on their lives was stark, compelling and upsetting. I felt very strongly that they#d waited too long. It was an incredible privilege for me to able to help them. It was without doubt the most important thing that I#ve ever done.I found it extremely emotional and a huge honour to be part of their journey.Victim Margaret McGuckin was impressed: My experience means a lack of trust for the authorities is inbred. We were let down by so many other officials and Secretaries of State. Within minutes of meeting Julian Smith, I knew he was a good one. You always feel these government people are looking down on you. With him, it felt we were on the same level, or even that he looked up to us a bit.A passionate Remainer, Smith was axed by the Prime Minister just a month after New Decade, New Approach. His sacking was linked to a Brexit-related tweet four months earlier which was interpreted as a put-down of Dominic Cummings. He maintains that he is not bitter. There has been some speculation that, in a post-Cummings era, Downing Street could come calling with the offer of another Cabinet position.

It may not be an immediate prospect but it can be argued that every rational reason for the partition of a century ago has either been eroded, or has disappeared entirely,” Mr Salmond said.The Times newspaper report the programme follows a warning from the UK parliament intelligence security committee this week, accusing Russia of using state-owned broadcasters like RT to spread disinformation, including efforts to “interfere with the UK democratic process”.During the debate Mr Ahern said the current Taoiseach, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, was right to be cautious about demands for an immediate border poll in order to align Northern Ireland with EU regulations.“The harsh reality is, even though the border has been a big issue on the island since , the amount of work, preparedness and analysis on how you would eliminate it and have one island economy is very little — it wouldn’t even fill one folder,” he said.“There is a huge amount of preparedness, legislative examination, legal examination, how you would integrate the police forces, the legal systems, all of these things would have to be worked through before you could go to the people.“That work has never been done. We’ve been talking at each other for years. If somebody wants to rush it for political reasons, you will get a political answer and the people will reject it.”He added: “My view is not that we should never do it, of course I’m a Republican and it is the number one aim of Fianna Fail . . . but it has to be done properly, properly organised, properly negotiated, trying to convince people, and any other way will only lead to hardship and failure.”A Scottish Conservative spokesman also told The Times: “Far from distancing himself from the Russian state, Mr Salmond appears to be revelling in his role as a useful idiot.“Certainly his Russian overlords will be delighted that he is actively proposing the disruption of the United Kingdom in this way.”Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern IrelandFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandSplit in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionRUC widow Fiona Willis on defiance  years after IRA bombing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston officers still continue their duties even during these trying times.He added: Those who believe they can hide in the US from their crimes including terrorist activities they committed in other countries are in for a rude awakening. ICE remains committed to removing dangerous foreign nationals from the US, even those who may have managed to evade immigration law for a y period of time.The statement added: ICE is focused on removing public safety threats, such as convicted criminal aliens and gang members, as well as iniduals who have violated our nation#s immigration laws and those convicted of terrorist activities, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges.Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern IrelandFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandSplit in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionRUC widow Fiona Willis on defiance  years after IRA bombing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One of the things we#ve failed to think about is how those transport links work together for the benefit of our entire UK, he added.In our Facebook poll - which is still open - a whopping % of people voting thought the link was a good idea, with just % giving the idea the thumbs down.As we went to press last night, almost , of our online readers had cast their votes in our unscientic poll, with hundreds leaving comments for and against the Boris bridge.One, Stephen Bleue, wrote: I think it would be great to have a road bridge even with a toll as the ferry is very expensive. I know people pour cold water on the idea, but mainland Britain is linked to Europe by a tunnel and look at the benefits that this had provided. We could literally drive from Northern Ireland right across Europewe had a bridge to Scotland and it would link the whole of the UK - which has to be beneficial.Belfast-based Stephen Wray agreed: What is negative about this  Yes, in my opinion it#s something unique, dferent and costs money. Isambard Kingdom Brunel#s feats spring to mind.David Alexander also gave the bridge the thumbs-up. Yes... would bring economic benefit and convenience to the whole of the British Isles. Not surea bridge or tunnel would be best.But not everyone was convinced spanning the Irish Sea was worthwhile.Bryan Hayward reckoned: It#d only be open for maybe a few months total, a year tops, the rest of the time it#d be swinging like a skipping rope.

Read More Split in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionOnly six councillors lent their support to Mr Donnelly’s call for the council to voice its opposition to Campbell’s extradition from the Republic to Lithuania, where he is wanted on international weapons trafficking charges.Mr Gallagher described the motion as “perverse”.He said: “I will certainly sleep sound after watching the defeat of that perverse motion.“It was a bittersweet moment for me and I am sure for all the people of Omagh, bitter in that anyone would put the human rights of that manabove the people of Omagh after all we have suffered.“But it was sweet to see how strongly it was rejected.“Sinn Fein did the right thing in not supporting this motion, and seeing that was such a relief.”Mr Gallagher was critical of People Before Profit councillor Eamonn McCann and others who had opposed Campbell’s extradition, while stating their abhorrence of the  Real IRA bombing.But speaking on the motion, Mr McCann said he would support Mr Donnelly “on the same basis as we opposed extradition over the past  years”. However, he added: “Not only are we not associating ourselves with the cause of which it is alleged Mr Campbell pursued, we are against the strategy of so-called armed struggle altogether.”In a similar vein, Aontu councillor Dr Anne McCloskey and independent councillors Sean Carr and Paul Gallagher all said they would support the motion — but stated their opposition to the violence carried out in Omagh on the day of the atrocity.The DUP’s Graham Warke had tried to get his fellow councillors to agree to let Mr Gallagher address them ahead of the debate, but this was opposed.However, during the debate Mr Warke read out a statement on behalf of the Omagh families expressing their desire for Derry City and Strabane District Council to support a cross-border public inquiry into the circumstances of the Omagh bomb.Derry and Strabane was the second council to debate Campbell’s extradition, coming weeks after controversy in Fermanagh and Omagh, where a majority voted in support of Campbell.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood later apologised to the victims’ families and said when the matter came before the full council meeting held last night all of the party’s councillors would withdraw their support.Mr Gallagher said: “I was totally shocked that Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council put forward motions that aligned them with a man held liable for his part in the Omagh bomb.“This was the worst atrocity in the Troubles killing  people and maiming and injuring over  others.“It was shocking that the two council areas who raised this were the two councils in the north west.”Mr Gallagher added: “But I am so, so pleased and relieved the councillors in Derry and Strabane sent out the strong message that they will not support a man who is not even in this jurisdiction, he is not in either of these council areas.”Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern IrelandFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandSplit in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionRUC widow Fiona Willis on defiance  years after IRA bombing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Liam Campbell, from Dundalk, is wanted in Lithuania over allegations he was part of an operation to buy guns and bombs for the Real IRA.Last month, Dublin’s High Court ordered Campbell’s extradition to the Baltic state.Campbell was found liable in a civil court for the Omagh bomb in August , which claimed the lives of  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injured  others.Read More Michael Gallagher expresses relief after Derry council rejects Omagh bomb motion At a meeting of the council’s policy and resources committee earlier this month, independent councillor Bernice Swt sought support in opposing Campbell’s extradition to Lithuania, citing human rights concerns.The committee voted to oppose the extradition with the support of SDLP, Sinn Fein and others while DUP and Ulster Unionist councillors voted against.Members also agreed to write to Taoiseach Micheal Martin to voice the council’s opposition.The move provoked strong criticism, particularly of the SDLP. Leader Colum Eastwood MP later said his party members had been wrong to back the motion and would reverse the decision when it came before the full council for ratication last night.He also offered to meet with the Omagh families to express “profound regret”. The move had left victims of the atrocity “appalled and retraumatised”.Last night at the reconvened council meeting, members voted to stop the council’s support for Campbell by  votes to six with one abstention.While the SDLP changed its position to vote against the motion, four Sinn Fein members continued to support Campbell.The UUP had tabled a counter motion expressing solidarity with the victims of the bomb by writing to Mr Martin and urging him to “speedily resolve” Campbell’s extradition process.Proposing the motion, UUP councillor Victor Warrington said he hoped the council could now “consign this sorry episode in local government to the dustbin of history where it so rightfully belongs”. “This council should defend the innocent men, women, children and unborn who were cut down as they went about their daily lives and not the rights of an inidual whose only link to this district is that he was civilly liable for blowing signicant parts of it to hell and back, killing and maiming citizens and then fleeing, leaving devastation and broken families in his wake,” Mr Warrington said. DUP councillor Errol Thompson added: “Over the last couple of weeks our council has been brought into the gutter and that’s the view of many of our constituents.”Ms Swt accused Mr Warrington of “showing complete scant regard” for the Omagh bomb victims and said his motion fell “very short” in terms of support and solidarity. Sinn Fein tabled an amendment highlighting its concerns about the human rights of Campbell and its resolve to see those responsible for the bombing being held accountable, but this was one of four amendments ruled inadmissible. Last week DUP members of the council lodged a complaint to the Local Government Commissioner for Standards against councillor Swt and Sinn Fein’s council chairman Stephen McCann. They argued that the proposal raised by Ms Swt was not within the council’s remit and should not have been accepted by Mr McCann as reasonable business for the council to conduct. Claire Monteith, whose -year-old brother Alan Radford was killed in the blast, has also reported the two councillors to the local government ombudsman.

On one side were the two internationally recognised bodies north and south of the border, and on the other was the National Cycling Association- a group that wanted an all-Ireland organisation.The RTE Radio  documentary - entitled Green and Gold - speaks to some of the riders on both sides of the ide, as well as Lady Mary Peters, who won a gold medal for Great Britain in Munich before receiving a death threat, and Noel#s grandson Matthew, now an Irish international cyclist himself.The drama of the  cycling road race was played out against the backdrop of the Troubles and the Munich massacre, where Israeli Olympians were taken hostage and killed by Palestinian terrorist group Black September. Both the Troubles and the Munich massacre feature heavily in the  minute documentary.Lady Mary said  had been the worst year of the Troubles, with  people killed in terrorist attacks.I didn#t have a track to train on because the university track was full of potholes, she recalled in the documentary. It wasn#t easy. I didn#t have a car. I used to get two buses. One into the city centre and one out to the training track. I just did it, even though bombs were sometimes going off as you were travelling on the bus and I would be carrying my four kilo shot and my starting blocks. You just did it and I wanted to win so much.With audio from interviews carried out at the time - as well as a brief recording of sports commentator Jackie Fullerton - the documentary is sure to appeal not just to cycling enthusiasts but all Olympic fans.Since  the NCA had been barred from international competition and the group had protested at the  World Championships and the  Olympics. But in  they took the bold step of secretly joining the race itself.NCA cyclist John Mangan actually led the race for a period but was involved in a scuffle with the late Noel Teggart during the event. Kerry man John claimed that Noel had said: There#s a lot of southern b******s around this morning - but that was flatly rejected by Noel#s teammate Kieron McQuaid.As we came near the top of the hill on the next lap, I saw Teggart being pushed from behind into the crowd, Kieron recalled in the documentary.All of a sudden I passed the two of them and my first thought was, #Do I stop and go back and help him #Noel Teggart was a truck driver and I was only a -year-old student, he was well able to handle himself. I thought there was no point in going back because he was well able to handle himself so I just kept going.I didn#t see him again until after we finished and needless to say he was not in good shape, he was disconsolate and he was heartbroken.Following the controversy at Munich, Irish cycling transformed into an all-Ireland power-sharing body - something championed by Noel after he and John made their peace.An RTE interview carried out just after the Olympic road race with an unnamed spokesperson from the NCA team, who was from Northern Ireland, revealed why they protested.We were protesting against Britain#s interference in Irish affairs to the extent that the NCA is not internationally recognised, the man said.Producers David Coughlan and Donal O#Herlihy interviewed Noel#s grandson Matthew , as well as his father Neil Teggart as part of the documentary.It was really [my grandfather] who was the turning point in the whole ide north and south because of what happened to him at the Olympics so now anyone cycling in Ireland, north or south, you ride for Ireland, Matthew said.Green and Gold will air on RTE Radio  tomorrow at pm.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final. Pat was captain, Adrian is wearing Alfie Dallas swapped Banagher jersey. Mick was club Chairman, after managing the Shamrocks to the  title The game proved to be a long struggle before Ballinderry emerged winners, - to -. It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final. Pat was captain, Adrian is wearing Alfie Dallas swapped Banagher jersey.

Speculation was mounting over the feasibility of the club championships at the weekend, after  clubs suspended their senior activities following positive cases of Covid-. Banagher and Craigbane acted first, on Thursday night, before they were joined by Ardmore, Limavady, Drumsurn, Magilligan, Glack, Foreglen, Claudy and Drum followed suit. Drum have extended their cessation of activities until Monday, July . “This is a matter for the organising committee, in this instance Derry GAA, to manage as they see fit,” said Alan Milton, the GAAs Director of Communications, while also saying it was discussed with counties on a conference call last week. googletag.cmd.push The GAA has ed to games activity on the principle of opt-in added Declan Woods, Ulster GAAs PRO. “Given the uncertainties that exist around Covid-, each county has been asked to draft Competition Rules to deal with potential scenarios.” Derry have indicated that their championships, starting with Saturdays hurling clash of Banagher and Coleraine will go ahead. Games will he played as scheduled,” a Derry board spokesperson told the County Derry Post. With no movement away from the scheduled date anda club cannot fulfill a fixture due to issues surrounding Covid-, the game will be awarded to the opposition team without any further penalty being imposed. googletag.cmd.push Of the  clubs who stood down at the weekend, Banagher were advised one of their members has been confirmed as positive for the virus. It is understood to be a player and the club moved by insisting all their players get tested. “We resume training on Wednesday night,” outlined senior hurling manager John ODwyer. “Only players who come back with a negative test will be permitted to train or to play in Saturdays game with Coleraine.” The former Derry camogie manager, who won back to back Ulster titles with the countys hurlers, feels the GAA should pull the pin on the season. “For the sake of five games, they should have forgot about it and started again in January. For us in Banagher, we did everything according to plan and it takes a lot of effort to go through with the procedures. “For us, there is just not enough gain. If I wasnt the manager, I would be nowhere near it. Someone at a higher level shouldve made the decision to call off the season.” Grab this weeks County Derry Post for previews of this weekends hurling games. RELATEDThis weeks fixtures.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year, the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School because of the low number of pupils at the school. Groarty is the only integrated school on Derrys cityside. The proposal has now been agreed to by the Minister of Education Peter Weir. It had originally been proposed that the school would close at the end of August . However, the closure date has been extended to August . Mr Weir said: Having weighed up all the information, including the fact that  of the  pupils will be exiting P, with no new intake for - or September , it is clear that unfortunately the school is not sustainable, and that provision for any pupils in an integrated setting can be made where in the city. googletag.cmd.push The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained integrated status in . A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and Mr Weir at the beginning of this year. However, the decision was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. Following that decision, numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. googletag.cmd.push The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the Waterside. The school caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

The winner then had to survive a stewardsrsquo enquiry.The duo followed up their success in the next race, the Randox Health Maiden Hurdle, when Soildels Hill put in a strong late run up the hill to win in smooth style over - shot Knot on Time and Memories Remain.With the duo not included in the following race, the third success of the day came in the second ide of theHandicap Hurdle.In this race Irsquom on Sap, owned and trained at Dromara by Neil McCluskey, set out to make the running under Eoin Walsh and still held the call at the final flight.But once Russell sent his mount Give Him Time into the lead, it was all over, the - shot beating the - favourite ldquoMiraculumand the long time leader, which stayed on for third.Despite these three wins, Elliottrsquos runner Curlew Hill, with top jockey Jamie Codd in the saddle, was an easy to back - favourite in the concluding Toals Dial-a-Bet bumper race.Always looking good, Curlew Hill won in good style over Patrick Mullins on ldquoRuaille Buaille with ldquoCrobally Boy back in third.Former champion flat jockey Joseph OrsquoBrien has been a great supporter of the local track since he set up as a trainer, and it was good to see him on the mark in the opening mares maiden hurdle when his charge, the - favourite, Etincelle Lioterie, ridden by his cousin JJ Slevin, won in good style from Rock me Robin, ridden by highly rated amateur Jordan Gainford, and Coosan Clover.There was a right old shock in the dayrsquos second race, the RandoxMaiden hurdle when the nine year-old Walkers Point emerged the winner.Always well placed under amateur Noel McParlan who sent his mount into pole position with two flights left to take the - shot, stayed on well to the post to beat the - favourite Ya Boy Yaand Felino De Bersy for the Elliott Russell combination.The winner is trained at Cabra by the jockeyrsquos father, Sean, and paid pound. on the tote. This is not the first big priced winner for the duo as they once won with a - shot across the water.This was not the only local winner of the day.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11611702.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFollowing incidents of antisocial and inappropriate behaviour and mass gatherings at Ogmore-by-Sea and Barry Island, the council has taken steps to respond to unacceptable behaviour.The car park at Rivermouth, Ogmore-by-Sea, was closed last Thursday night and will remain closed until Monday, July  while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the short term, to deal with issues caused by antisocial behaviour such as littering, camping, inappropriate parking, overnight stays and noise.MORE STORIESAnti-social behaviour at Barry Island could cause lockdown measures to be reconsideredBarry Island sees visitors flouting beach and coronavirus lockdown rulesHippy Crack and broken glass blights Barry beachTemporary road closures will remain in place with access for residents only on Seaview Drive.Parking will be controlled on the main road through Ogmore-by-Sea The council has worked to ensure police and council staff are present this weekend to deal with any potential issues.Further measures to control the consumption of alcohol in these destinations is being organised where joint police and council enforcement officers will seize alcohol that is being carried and consumed in breach of existing regulations.The council is seeking longer term solutions to better manage resort car parking at Ogmore-by-Sea, Barry Island, Cosmeston, and Penarth Esplanade and the council will engage with local communities in managing car parking in these locations.Displacement parking in residential areas surrounding these destinations will also be addressed with provision for resident parking and short-stay spaces.This work will be progressed with close engagement with residents.The council will, in the coming weeks, be consulting residents, landowners, Vale councillors and community councils to ensure that all concerns are addressed.Vale council leader, Cllr Neil Moore, said: ldquoWe need to ensure that our coastal resorts and tourist destinations remain attractive and are equipped to offer a quality visitor experience, without having a detrimental impact on residents and communities.ldquoOur car parking infrastructure is being modernised and I have allocated money in this yearrsquos budget to provide better parking management of surrounding residential areas where it is needed.\"We are seeking to address these issues as quickly as possible, given the signicant increase in visitors to the Vale coast.ldquoTourism plays a vital role in the Vale of Glamorganrsquos economy and the council is committed to supporting and further developing the local tourist and visitor experience whilst at the same time minimising impact on our residents who live and work in our coastal towns and villages.South Wales Police chief inspector for the Vale of Glamorgan, Anthony Williams has met local residents to provide reassurance about the work being undertaken by the force and its partners.CI Williams said: ldquoWe appreciate the coronavirus lockdown measures have been dficult for our communities, but the kind of behaviour seen recently at Ogmore-by-Sea and other coastal areas is simply unacceptable.ldquoMass gatherings are still prohibited under Welsh Government legislation, and Irsquod remind those considering attending our beauty spots to consider the risks they could be posing to themselves and their loved onesthey are not complying with legislation and guidance.ldquoAntisocial behaviour will not be tolerated at any time ndash regardless of whether we are in the midst of a pandemic or not ndash and we will continue to work closely with partners, including the local authority, to ensure those wanting to enjoy our beaches and parks within the confines of the law can do so safely and without fear or intimidation.ldquoOur communities can expect to see an increased police presence in some areas, and officers will make use of powers available to them, including dispersal orders, confiscation powers and enforcement action.ldquoWe canrsquot be everywhere all of the time, however, and I would also appeal to people to take some personal responsibility and to be considerate of others.\"Parents should also be ensuring they know where their children are and what they are doing. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityJunk food adverts are expected to be banned on television before the pm watershed, and online entirely, and promotions on snacks will be curbed in an attempt to tackle the nationrsquos waistlines when the Government launches a campaign on obesity next week.Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reported that restaurant and takeaway chains will have to publish the number of calories in the meals they serve, while shops will have to do the same with any alcohol they sell.The moves comes after Boris Johnson has been looking at his own weight since he was admitted to intensive care with Covid- in April.Speaking on Friday, Mr Johnson said he had lost more than a stone since his health scare, and reiterated that being obese is a risk factor when it comes to coronavirus.On a visit to a GP surgery in London on Friday, the Prime Minister said he would ldquoencourage people to lose weight this summer.He added: ldquoIrsquom not normally a believer in nannying, or bossing type of politics. But the reality is that obesity is one of the real comorbidity factors. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a visit to Tollgate Medical Centre in Beckton in east London ldquoLosing weight is, frankly, one of the ways that you can reduce your own risks from Covid.Later, in an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said: ldquoOne of the lessons I drew from that is the need for us all to be fitter and healthier.ldquoAndwersquore fitter and healthier by the way, we will also be happier.The Obesity Health Alliance has welcomed the reported curbs on ldquorelentless advertising and promotion of unhealthy food.Caroline Cerny, lead at the organisation said: ldquoThere is overwhelming evidence that junk food advertising works.ldquoSo when adverts for unhealthy food and drinks dominate prime-time TV and social media, while the nation struggles to maintain a healthy weight, this is a problem.She believes the ldquoincentive to the food industry to reduce sugar, fat and salt from their products would ldquobenefit everyone.Doctors have also welcomed the proposals, but say that promises have been made before and a ldquofirm and sustained commitment from Government to address obesity and poor diet is needed.The British Medical Associationrsquos Professor Dame Parveen Kumar said ldquosuccessive governments have shied away from effective regulation for far too long and added: ldquoWe must have a comprehensive and well-resourced strategy to ensure that from now on the health of the nation is made a priority. vw,vw,px, px\" vw,vw,px, px\"Chairman of the National Obesity Forum, Tam Fry, also believes the proposals are ldquonot enough and ldquoyou need to have an across-the-board approach to everything in le which affects obesity.The Prime Minister has also faced a backlash from those in the food and advertising industries who are concerned about the potential impact on jobs.The Food and Drink Federationcalled the proposals a ldquoslap in the face to an industry already struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The organisationrsquos boss, Tim Rycroft, questioned the plans, given that the Government is trying to encourage people back in to pubs and restaurants to stimulate the economy.He said: ldquoWe could see a ban on promotions of food such as mustard and mint sauce, days before the launch of the Chancellorrsquos Eat Out to Help Out campaign.ldquoWe could have the Great British Bake Off with no cake adverts allowed.Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, told the PA news agency: ldquoWe think the Government should be focused on things that work, rather than things that are headline grabbing initiatives that in effect industry pays for.ldquoPaying for it means that jobs go and prosperity is harmed..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Doctors say  ufirm commitment u needed for real obesity change article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
