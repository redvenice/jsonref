I found it hilarious.\u0027          The chat began with Jon asking for a picture of \u0027the other side\u0027 of the flag from the Facebook sellerDuring the protracted negotiations, Jon asked the man \u0027how does it cope under windy conditions mate? Does it gracefully flutter or is it more of a wobble?\u0027 to which the seller replied \u0027gracefully\u0027.He even asked for the unnamed seller to take a picture of the other side of the flag - despite it being translucent.But the 26-year-old claimed it was only during the process of considering whether to buy the flag he realised it was damaged with a hole - and despite offering £1.83, this was rejected.          Jon insisted he wanted an image of the other side of the translucent flag from the person selling it over the internet           The seller obliged but refused to lie down next to the flag for a photo to give an idea of its size           The father-of-one prankster continued to make bizarre requests during the conversation, last Thursday          The seller said it was \u0027white and red\u0027 rather than \u0027red and white\u0027 when asked by Mr Pilkington          The hilarious conversation went on with the man finally revealing the flag has a hole in it - although he mis-typed it \u0027hoe\u0027          The seller who was clearly still fooled even took a picture of the hole to send to the potential buyer Jon, who is dad to a six-year-old boy, said he has been hit with social media trolling of his own with many online commentators criticizing his post.He said: \u0027Never in my life have I bullied anyone nor was I then - it\u0027s good to have some fun on social media, as long as it\u0027s in good taste.\u0027If people feel sorry for the guy, then from what I can see he\u0027s trying to sell loads of stuff.\u0027By all means drop him a message and help him out financially.\u0027If anyone would be interested to purchase the flag, then my research shows it\u0027s still available.\u0027However they should know from the start, there is a hole.\u0027This information was not made apparent to me until it was nearly too late.\u0027           The conversation ended when the seller refused to take £1.83 for the flag after the revelation it had a hole in it"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/15/4E5064B200000578-0-image-a-57_1531752630777.jpg","title":"Brides Christ dont need virgins Vatican announces stating chastity not essential","story":"    The Vatican has declared women who pledge to lifelong virginity as part of their spiritual pursuit needn\u0027t actually be virgins in a physical sense          An estimated 5,000 women around the world are consecrated virgins as part of vows to remain sacred for ChristOutlining details of the female consecration, which comes after the Vatican said there was rising interest in taking vows to \u0027marry\u0027 Christ, the document read:\u0027The call to give witness to the Church\u0027s virginal, spousal and fruitful love for Christ is not reducible to the symbol of physical integrity.\u0027Thus to have kept her body in perfect continence or to have practiced the virtue of chastity in an exemplary way, while of great importance with regard to the discernment, are not essential prerequisites in the absence of which admittance to consecration is not possible.\u0027In reaction, US Association of Consecrated Virgins said it was \u0027shocking\u0027 to hear physical virginity is no longer a necessity to a life of consecration. \u0027The entire tradition of the Church has firmly upheld that a woman must have received the gift of virginity – both physical and spiritual – in order to receive the consecration of virgins,\u0027 the group said in a statement.

Just for the east side of the country. The south and central areas are likely to continue with the higher 20s.’Next week will welcome showers and possible thunderstorms for those in the south of England.When will the UK heatwave end?Although the UK will have a long period of sunny weather until August, bookies have predicted that the heatwave could end as early as next week as July enters the record books as the wettest ever.Forecaster Amy Hodgson of The Weather Channel said: ‘Increased cloud with outbreaks of light rain will affect Ireland and Scotland over the weekend, whilst England and Wales will be dry and mostly sunny.‘It will be a hot and humid weekend in a south-westerly flow, with maximum temperatures in the mid to high 20s across England and Wales, but cooler across Ireland and Scotland with highs in the high teens to low 20s.’          The heatwave could end as early as next week as July enters record books as the wettest everAlongside this, according to a Met Office forecaster, the weather will be ‘less hot, is the best way to describe next week, but it will still be warm. There will be some sunny spells but there will be a few showers around that could be heavy and thundery.‘All parts of the UK will see some spells of sunshine, but there is likely to be relatively more in the way of rain or showers at times too. Some of the showers could be heavy or thundery at times.‘There may also be bands of more persistent rain on occasion which may bring some stronger winds too, especially to northern and western parts. These bands of rain could occur at any time but become more likely later on in the period.The best of the fine weather and sunny conditions looks to be in the east and southeast of the UK. Temperatures will be close to average in the northwest, but with light winds it will still feel very warm at times across the south and east.’UK heatwave historyDuring the UK heatwave 2018, many parallels have been made with the hot weather that consumed the country during the summer of 1976. As reported in The Mirror, Met Office forecaster John Hammond said: ‘Hot and dry weather breeds hot and dry weather. This effect was seen in 1976.’However, the driest summer on record was in 1995, with only 64.7 ml of rain in June, July and August. The average for June this year was 35.4ml, which makes it one of the five warmest Junes in the UK since 1910.June 2018 was also one of the hottest for more than 300 years, bordering on the top 10 since records began 359 years ago.Who is Hayley Roberts?

Brexiteer MP DAVID DAVIES (no,...Share this articleMr Davis\u0027s remarks came after an emotive speech from Tory former minister Anna Soubry, as she urged Tory colleagues to have a \u0027reality check\u0027 on Brexit and how the party is conducting itself.She also said a group of 40 \u0027hard, no deal Brexiteers\u0027 should be \u0027seen off\u0027 by the Government.The stormy scenes in the Commons emerged after the Government said it would accept four amendments to the Bill, which allows the UK to establish a new customs regime and ensure VAT and excise laws operate as required upon Brexit, tabled by Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers.Ms Soubry was among those who said she could not support new clause 36 - which prevents the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless the EU agrees to collect them from the UK - and amendment 73, which stops the UK from joining the EU\u0027s VAT regime.          The PM insisted she was pressing ahead with the controversial proposals despite accepting amendments to the crucial Customs Bill that appear to damage them fatallyTory former attorney general Dominic Grieve labelled the two amendments as \u0027unnecessary\u0027 and \u0027useless\u0027, adding the only reason behind their tabling was \u0027malevolent\u0027.Speaking at the Bill\u0027s report stage, Tory former Cabinet minister Mr Davis said \u0027the most difficult issue\u0027 was that of the border in Northern Ireland, adding: \u0027There\u0027s no way however that a UK Government is ever going to install a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u0027Surrounded by Brexiteers, Mr Davis also said: \u0027There may be 300 border crossings, but there are only six ports. So rest of world imports can actually be surveilled and controlled very straightforwardly.\u0027So the issue which has got much more difficult since becoming politicised, it was actually working quite well in negotiations before it became politicised is eminently soluble, soluble by technical means, soluble by co-operation between the two states.\u0027          Boris Johnson resigned the day after David Davis, part of a turbulent weekend for Mrs May and her Brexit blueprintMr Davis told MPs that what the UK would have to give up to join a customs arrangement with the EU \u0027is much more than is imagined\u0027.He said: \u0027The European Union is a slow and not very effective negotiator of free trade agreements, we keep hearing about their negotiating power, their size.\u0027Actually the fact that they represent 28 different countries means they come up with sub-optimal outcomes all the time and actually we\u0027re the country that does least well out of the EU free trade agreements.\u0027He went on to tell MPs that the UK had distinct advantages \u0027over and above our economic weight\u0027, he said: \u0027We have the English language, we have English law, we\u0027re leaders in life sciences, artificial intelligence, Internet, medicine, a whole series of areas.\u0027Ms Soubry was earlier told by Tory former minister Sir Edward Leigh she \u0027ain\u0027t no Margaret Thatcher\u0027 after she praised the former prime minister for her support of free trade.          Dominic Raab is the new Brexit Secretary charged with getting Mrs May\u0027s vision advanced in Parliament and at the EU negotiationsSir Edward\u0027s remarks prompted shouts of \u0027pathetic\u0027 from some Tory backbenchers.Ms Soubry later said: \u0027This Government is in grave danger of not just losing the plot but losing a considerable amount of support from the people of this country unless we get Brexit right.\u0027Ms Soubry went on: \u0027Members on the frontbench and across this place should be shaking their heads with shame - this is the stuff of complete madness.\u0027And the only reason that the Government has accepted these amendments is because it is frightened of somewhere in the region of 40 Members of Parliament - the hard, no deal Brexiteers, who should have been seen off a long time ago and should be seen off.\u0027These are people who do not want a responsible Brexit, they want their version of Brexit - they don\u0027t even represent the people who actually voted Leave.\u0027The consequences of this are grave, not just for our country but also for this party.\u0027Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke, on the Government accepting Brexiteer amendments, said: \u0027If one week after the Government has set out a policy which I\u0027m prepared personally to give a fair wind to, I find that they are going to accept amendments like new clause 73 and new clause 36 which promptly change the policy in a quite ridiculous way I shall despair.\u0027          David Davis (left) and Boris Johnson (centre) both quit Theresa May\u0027s government after a showdown at Chequers, the prime minster\u0027s country residence in Buckinghamshire"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/20/4E529A1200000578-5958393-image-a-123_1531769351623.jpg","title":"Croatian football team receive heroes welcome return Zagreb","story":"    The Croatian football team wore their silver medals as they stood atop an open top bus in the capital          Thousands of fans crowded into Bana Jelacica Square in Zagreb to catch a glimpse of their heroes this evening          Fans held up a replica of the World Cup trophy as they cheered and screamed at the arrival of the Croatian football team          Croatia\u0027s captain Luka Modric celebrated enthusiastically despite losing 4-2 to France          After getting off the bus the team were greeted with confetti in the national colours    The Croatian football team were given a heroes\u0027 welcome despite their loss to France, having reached the final for the first time          Earlier today Croatians held a giant banner with the national colours of the country          The team looked jubilant as they greeted crowds.

I found it hilarious.\u0027          The chat began with Jon asking for a picture of \u0027the other side\u0027 of the flag from the Facebook sellerDuring the protracted negotiations, Jon asked the man \u0027how does it cope under windy conditions mate? Does it gracefully flutter or is it more of a wobble?\u0027 to which the seller replied \u0027gracefully\u0027.He even asked for the unnamed seller to take a picture of the other side of the flag - despite it being translucent.But the 26-year-old claimed it was only during the process of considering whether to buy the flag he realised it was damaged with a hole - and despite offering £1.83, this was rejected.          Jon insisted he wanted an image of the other side of the translucent flag from the person selling it over the internet           The seller obliged but refused to lie down next to the flag for a photo to give an idea of its size           The father-of-one prankster continued to make bizarre requests during the conversation, last Thursday          The seller said it was \u0027white and red\u0027 rather than \u0027red and white\u0027 when asked by Mr Pilkington          The hilarious conversation went on with the man finally revealing the flag has a hole in it - although he mis-typed it \u0027hoe\u0027          The seller who was clearly still fooled even took a picture of the hole to send to the potential buyer Jon, who is dad to a six-year-old boy, said he has been hit with social media trolling of his own with many online commentators criticizing his post.He said: \u0027Never in my life have I bullied anyone nor was I then - it\u0027s good to have some fun on social media, as long as it\u0027s in good taste.\u0027If people feel sorry for the guy, then from what I can see he\u0027s trying to sell loads of stuff.\u0027By all means drop him a message and help him out financially.\u0027If anyone would be interested to purchase the flag, then my research shows it\u0027s still available.\u0027However they should know from the start, there is a hole.\u0027This information was not made apparent to me until it was nearly too late.\u0027           The conversation ended when the seller refused to take £1.83 for the flag after the revelation it had a hole in it"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/19/4E52487300000578-5959943-image-a-150_1531764916742.jpg","title":"Former Spanish king accused money laundering ex mistress sparking calls investigation","story":"    Spain\u0027s former king Juan Carlos finds himself in the spotlight again after claims from a former mistress have come to light          Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, seen here with Juan Carlos in 2006, has accused the abdicated royal of hiding money and buying property in her nameThe latest scandal emerged after recordings of Sayn-Wittgenstein\u0027s conversation were published by two Spanish websites.AFP reported the German aristocrat\u0027s allegations that Juan Carlos told her he had moved money into the account of a cousin, Alvaro d\u0027Orleans Bourbon, in Switzerland.She claims he also pocketed money from a high-speed train contract with Saudi Arabia, saying he wanted money to orce his wife Sofia and marry her.    The German aristocrat, who is 27 years younger than her former lover, reportedly ended her affair with Juan Carlos in 2014           Juan Carlos is alleged to have bought property in Monaco using Sayn-Wittgenstein\u0027s nameMonochrome monarch!

Brexiteer MP DAVID DAVIES (no,...Share this articleMr Davis\u0027s remarks came after an emotive speech from Tory former minister Anna Soubry, as she urged Tory colleagues to have a \u0027reality check\u0027 on Brexit and how the party is conducting itself.She also said a group of 40 \u0027hard, no deal Brexiteers\u0027 should be \u0027seen off\u0027 by the Government.The stormy scenes in the Commons emerged after the Government said it would accept four amendments to the Bill, which allows the UK to establish a new customs regime and ensure VAT and excise laws operate as required upon Brexit, tabled by Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers.Ms Soubry was among those who said she could not support new clause 36 - which prevents the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless the EU agrees to collect them from the UK - and amendment 73, which stops the UK from joining the EU\u0027s VAT regime.          The PM insisted she was pressing ahead with the controversial proposals despite accepting amendments to the crucial Customs Bill that appear to damage them fatallyTory former attorney general Dominic Grieve labelled the two amendments as \u0027unnecessary\u0027 and \u0027useless\u0027, adding the only reason behind their tabling was \u0027malevolent\u0027.Speaking at the Bill\u0027s report stage, Tory former Cabinet minister Mr Davis said \u0027the most difficult issue\u0027 was that of the border in Northern Ireland, adding: \u0027There\u0027s no way however that a UK Government is ever going to install a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u0027Surrounded by Brexiteers, Mr Davis also said: \u0027There may be 300 border crossings, but there are only six ports. So rest of world imports can actually be surveilled and controlled very straightforwardly.\u0027So the issue which has got much more difficult since becoming politicised, it was actually working quite well in negotiations before it became politicised is eminently soluble, soluble by technical means, soluble by co-operation between the two states.\u0027          Boris Johnson resigned the day after David Davis, part of a turbulent weekend for Mrs May and her Brexit blueprintMr Davis told MPs that what the UK would have to give up to join a customs arrangement with the EU \u0027is much more than is imagined\u0027.He said: \u0027The European Union is a slow and not very effective negotiator of free trade agreements, we keep hearing about their negotiating power, their size.\u0027Actually the fact that they represent 28 different countries means they come up with sub-optimal outcomes all the time and actually we\u0027re the country that does least well out of the EU free trade agreements.\u0027He went on to tell MPs that the UK had distinct advantages \u0027over and above our economic weight\u0027, he said: \u0027We have the English language, we have English law, we\u0027re leaders in life sciences, artificial intelligence, Internet, medicine, a whole series of areas.\u0027Ms Soubry was earlier told by Tory former minister Sir Edward Leigh she \u0027ain\u0027t no Margaret Thatcher\u0027 after she praised the former prime minister for her support of free trade.          Dominic Raab is the new Brexit Secretary charged with getting Mrs May\u0027s vision advanced in Parliament and at the EU negotiationsSir Edward\u0027s remarks prompted shouts of \u0027pathetic\u0027 from some Tory backbenchers.Ms Soubry later said: \u0027This Government is in grave danger of not just losing the plot but losing a considerable amount of support from the people of this country unless we get Brexit right.\u0027Ms Soubry went on: \u0027Members on the frontbench and across this place should be shaking their heads with shame - this is the stuff of complete madness.\u0027And the only reason that the Government has accepted these amendments is because it is frightened of somewhere in the region of 40 Members of Parliament - the hard, no deal Brexiteers, who should have been seen off a long time ago and should be seen off.\u0027These are people who do not want a responsible Brexit, they want their version of Brexit - they don\u0027t even represent the people who actually voted Leave.\u0027The consequences of this are grave, not just for our country but also for this party.\u0027Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke, on the Government accepting Brexiteer amendments, said: \u0027If one week after the Government has set out a policy which I\u0027m prepared personally to give a fair wind to, I find that they are going to accept amendments like new clause 73 and new clause 36 which promptly change the policy in a quite ridiculous way I shall despair.\u0027          David Davis (left) and Boris Johnson (centre) both quit Theresa May\u0027s government after a showdown at Chequers, the prime minster\u0027s country residence in Buckinghamshire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd7291a87037d6d1cbf9f0c632caa973ee4cbef/414_1961_6762_4057/master/6762.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ddc23cb95bf5820a7f447eca8b15847","title":"new brighton revisited three decades in pictures","story":"A group show brings together for the first time the New Brighton pictures of internationally renowned British photographers Martin Parr, Ken Grant and Tom Wood.

And how does such disproportionate variation of representation skew perspectives of minority groups?” asked the report. “Topics such as conflict and the refugee experience are valid subjects for authors to explore and unpick. Our concern would be if children only encounter ethnic minority representation in that context and no other,” Serroukh told the . “We need books like that, but they need to sit within a wider diet of books so readers can appreciate that people from minority backgrounds have as much variety of life as everyone else – yes, there is struggle, but there is also going to the dentist, going to the supermarket. It’s striking a balance.”The report states that “every child is entitled to feel safe and valued”, and that “in the current socio-political and economic climate the risk of marginalisation is even greater”. It warns publishers that if children do not see their realities reflected in the world around them or only see problematic representations mirrored back at them, the impact can be tremendously damaging. “To redress imbalances in representation is not an act of charity but an act of necessity that benefits and enriches all of our realities,” the report adds.Author Nikesh Shukla, who has been a major force behind the push for ersity in UK publishing, sat on a steering committee for CLPE’s report.“I do feel the industry is getting better but a report like this is a reminder of how much work still needs to be done – and a stark reminder of our readers, and how our readers are not getting what they need,” he said.“When you’re figuring out the world, being able to see yourself in books, as well as people who don’t look like you, is really important. It means you see your story as valid, and it can contribute to who you imagine yourself to be – and a kid should be able to imagine themselves as anyone in the world. These mirrors are so important.”His words echo those of the late American children’s author Walter Dean Myers, who wrote in 2014: “Books transmit values. They explore our common humanity. What is the message when some children are not represented in those books? … Where are black children going to get a sense of who they are and what they can be?”Serroukh said that the CLPE had plans to work with publishers to help them improve. Recommendations include increasing investment in authors from a range of backgrounds, looking for stories where main characters are BAME, and ensuring that they are not “predominantly defined by their struggle, suffering or ‘otherness’”.“At the moment, every title out there featuring BAME characters shoulders a heavy weight. It has to fulfil so many expectations,” said Serroukh. “It comes back to the issue around volume. If there are more books which are representative, then there is more opportunity for wider experiences to be expressed.”Serroukh writes in the report’s foreword: “We know that those who work in all areas of children’s books and literacy recognise that there is work to be done. We want to channel the momentum to ensure that this isn’t reduced to an awkward footnote or ‘trend’ in the history of UK children’s publishing because something as integral as a person’s identity and sense of self deserves to be recognised, respected and valued now and always.”Like a long-running equivalent survey in the US from the University of Wisconsin-Madison – which has charted a slow increase in BAME characters over the last decade and a half – the CLPE report is intended to be annual. A separate piece of research, by the BookTrust, is also currently under way, examining the number of authors and illustrators of colour working in children’s publishing. The BookTrust findings are due in September.Serroukh said she hoped CLPE’s research would be useful as a starting point to help publishers reflect. “Hopefully in 10 years’ time, or however long, it will become redundant,” she said. “We are really keen for the UK market to develop a more nuanced conversation. We don’t want to be talking about volume in three years’ time, but about quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3332f763f3e57985224a0a8a7a02c515f4e09f5d/171_284_3048_1830/master/3048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=326439e4d3f761f657f167432e6a1ab9","title":"not the booker prize 2018 nominate your favourite book of the year","story":"The literary award decided by  readers is celebrating its 10th birthday – and now it’s down to you to choose the contendersThe Not the Booker prize is back.

These writers, and plenty of others who have taken part in the competition, have won prizes, sold books all over the world and helped build our shared literary culture. Once those nominations are in, we’ll compile our traditionally very long longlist and run a public vote to whittle those books down to five. That’s right: five. Like last year, we will then add a wildcard entry nominated by the excellent judges who helped us to choose the 2017 winner.When we’ve got those six books lined up, we’ll read each in turn at the rate of around about one a week, igniting further discussion, debate and – let’s hope – admiration and love. Then there’s the final vote, the judges’ panel and the beautiful moment when we get to bestow an actual  mug on the lucky winner.If you’d like to find out more details about the process, all ye need know is contained in our beautiful and truthful terms and conditions. And if you’d like to contribute a little more than your valued wisdom below the line, we’d love to hear from you about joining this year’s judging panel.The Not the Booker has always been about uncovering new talent, about finding voices ignored by the mainstream and I’m hoping for another excellent competition.

The board of John Laing Infrastructure Fund (JLIF), which invests in trains, hospitals, schools, police stations and so on, seems to be. It is “minded to recommend” a takeover offer at 142.5p, or £1.45bn, a price it surely would have rejected without a second thought last September when JLIF’s shares stood at 139p.The interesting question is why Dalmore and Equitix spy value where others see danger. Perhaps they think Corbyn will never reach Downing Street. Perhaps, as big investors in projects such as the Thames Tideway “super sewer” and the HS1 rail link, they think they are too big to be pushed around. Or perhaps, since they are managing money for a lot of pension funds and local authorities, they think a future Labour government wouldn’t bite too hard in practice.Whatever the explanation, this situation is odd. Stock markets are giving up on infrastructure and anything vaguely related to PFI. Yet private pools of capital, including pension fund money, are gung ho for more. Even allowing for different investment horizons, both camps can’t be right.The UK corporate governance code, it could be said, is an exercise in pointing out to boards what should have been obvious to them in the first place. Still, we should raise a small cheer that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC),  of the code, is introducing what could be called a “Persimmon clause” that would give remuneration committees powers to override “formulaic outcomes”.If such an arrangement had been in place at the housebuilder, the chief executive Jeff Fairburn’s £100m jackpot via a share-based scheme could have been cut down automatically to a less ridiculous size. As it was, Persimmon’s board had failed to put a cap on potential rewards and found itself begging Fairburn and a couple of his colleagues to be less greedy. The chairman and the chair of the pay committee resigned in shame or embarrassment. The FRC’s new stricture may prevent similar fiascos in future.Other reforms to be welcomed include the command that boards “should take into account workforce remuneration” and that executive directors’ pensions contributions “should be aligned with those available to the workforce”. Yes, there ought to be limits to how far a company can pretend its executive directors inhabit a different universe on pay, although implementation is obviously everything.In that context, it’s a shame that the reformed code, while talking a lot about the need for listed companies to have a “purpose”, left it wholly open to boards to decide how to take account of the views of staff and outsiders. The least demanding method is to designate a non-executive director to “engage” with stakeholders. It’s what the government, after abandoning its bullish talk about worker representation, signalled it wanted. But, come on, the formula is wishy-washy in the extreme.Is Elon Musk’s fan club getting worried? It should be. In recent weeks, the Tesla billionaire has taken angry shots at Wall Street analysts and the press, while sounding more interested in his space adventures than the earthly pursuit of ramping up the production of electric cars.Now Musk has made a baseless allegation against a British cave er involved in the Thailand rescue. One hopes the er, Vernon Unsworth, sues. Tesla investors may wish the same. If unchecked, the founder’s erratic behaviour could be a long-term danger to their wealth.

Air conditioning, private transport and water engineering have allowed urban settlements in arid areas to expand at a dizzying and unsustainable rate, while outdated paradigms of urban planning and design give little relief from rising temperatures.Cities around the world may find their water use restricted – Cape Town, South Africa and Shimla, India have already have already come dangerously close to “day zero”, when taps run dry – and their power infrastructure compromised by reliance on air conditioning. Standards of living are likely to fall. Heat islands, droughts and disrupted seasons will likely lead to more deaths – particularly among the young, the old and those with health issues. Cities will be publishing a special week of journalism next month investigating heat in cities, and we want to hear from you.How are rising temperatures affecting or changing your city? What, if anything, is being done to mitigate this? What concerns you most about sweltering summers and more frequent and extreme heatwaves and droughts? Do you have any suggestions for what could be done?Please share your experiences with us using the form below – or, if you’d prefer to speak with a member of the team directly, you’re welcome to email  Cities communities editor Elle Hunt via elle.hunt@the.We will be publishing a selection of responses as part of our special series on urban heat.

You might be tempted to say, “I don’t believe this poll because I don’t believe respondents have thought hard enough about what the question means.” You would be accused of underestimating the electorate, whose passion for sovereignty is more powerful than baser motives such as having enough to eat. You might also be tempted to say, “This poll is peculiarly contradictory, remainers seem to want ‘strength’ over ‘weakness’ as much as leavers.” But it’s not done to require a poll to make sense, all you can do is bow to the insights it provides.And yet it brings none. The relevant critique is not that people are failing to think ahead, or that sometimes democracy is too complicated for an opinion poll to mean much. Those things might be true, but they always have been: like the old aphorism about blaming gravity for a plane crash (yes, that’s the root cause: but gravity is always with us, and planes don’t always crash). We need to ask why polls are returning wild results on this occasion.As the House of Commons enters another bout of ever more arcane debate, governed by procedural niceties that baffle the public at large, Brexit has reached peak confusion. The Chequers deal, so long in its conception, has unravelled at record speed. The customs bill designed by May has been rerouted by amendments from hard Brexiteers. The question of what the EU will and won’t eventually accept is meanwhile being left to the adjudication of chancers. Bernard Jenkin made the absurd charge on the Today programme this morning that the Europeans were “bullying” us. How can that be? Until we can tell them what we want, all they can do is watch.As fudge, evasion and obscure parliamentary maneouvres confuse rather than clarify, people are being asked in polls to choose not between concrete options but between a series of postures: would you rather be strong or weak? Would you rather be in control or a vassal a rule-maker or a rule-taker? The terminology slides across the political spectrum with gay abandon. One minute, you’re “in control” if you agree with Boris Johnson that the Chequers deal would be a betrayal of Brexit. The next, you’re a “rule-maker” if you side with Peter Mandelson.Take any of these statements at face value, and the answers to the pollsters’ questions are obvious: I would rather be strong I would rather be in control I would rather not be a vassal, whatever that means in this context. But everyone knows the questions are too abstract, so there’s a certain amount of guessing as to what they are supposed to signify. You cannot infer much from the responses of people who are themselves inferring. It’s all riddles and guesses and long looks, all of us caught in an elaborate Elizabethan courtship process where no one knows the rules.Meanwhile, back in reality, where real decisions have to be made about real propositions, the big resignation speech – arriving, characteristically tardily, from David Davis – has been overshadowed by Justine Greening’s stunning move, breaking cover to become the first Tory remainer to call for a second referendum. It recalls the prescient analysis of David Lammy, who told me: “As the rubber hits the road over the coming weeks, largely because the EU will respond to our deal, and as Theresa May runs out of road, as the isions in her party, and in the Labour party, and in the country, become more and more magnified, the only way out of that is a fundamental democratic process. It is either an election, or a representative vote in parliament, or it is a second referendum on the deal. It’s inevitable that one of those three things has to happen.”It’s hard to say what’s been the greatest shock of the Brexit process, its technical complexity or the starkness of its choices. The two are linked, of course: if we’d been able to decide earlier between a soft, rule-taker-not-rule-maker Brexit and a hard, stockpile-food-and-close-the-ports Brexit, we’d have had two years to consider details and we would have needed every minute. Without that luxury, the task is absurd, like learning a language in a week. One thing has crystallised though: MPs cannot borrow any more legitimacy from mutable and often illegible polls. If they want to know what people think, they have to ask them at a ballot box, where it counts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46b23fa29acea45dc63a7e828af9e43ec8acb92/0_319_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d19a84a979a4e6a7bfb370adfcd1b1c5","title":"one reluctant cyclists attempt to ride 300 miles in a month week one","story":"Self-confessed couch potato Dominic Utton is not a Lycra man. So how will he cope with swapping the sofa for the saddle and devoting a month of his life to Cancer Research UK’s Cycle 300 challenge? We track his progress from 0 to 300Let’s get one thing straight: I am no serious cyclist. I have a bike, of course (I live in Oxford – everyone here has a bike), but it’s a bottom of the range, bog-standard mountain bike and I only ever use it to wobble to the shop and back. Also, the gears have been stuck on the lowest setting since last summer, which makes even that 10-minute ride look slightly ridiculous.So when someone suggested I take part in Cycle 300 this year, attempting to clock up 300 miles in a month in aid of Cancer Research UK, my first reaction was to laugh. But once I stopped laughing, I thought: “Why not?” Just so long as I don’t have to wear any Lycra. I’ve made a fair few embarrassing middle-aged-dad decisions in recent years, but I draw the line at Lycra.What the hell. I’ll give it a go.First things first: get the bike sorted. Luckily my street has an excellent cycle shop on the corner, so I booked in and finally got the gears fixed. Next: formulate a proper strategy.My plan – as someone with basically couch-potato levels of fitness – is twofold. First: I’m not going to do 10 miles a day right out of the gate. Let’s get real. Instead, I’m going for 50 miles in week one, 75 in week two, and 88 for the two following that. Will this be realistic? Who knows? It looks OK right now.Second: to start with I’m going to stick to cycling along towpaths. I live close to both the Thames and the Oxford canal, and not only do they offer pretty views, but (and this is the really cunning part), towpaths are by their very nature, flat. Water does not flow uphill – therefore, I will not need to cycle uphill.Is this cheating? Of course not! I’m going to try to ride 300 miles in one month, for crying out loud. At least let me try to tilt the odds a little in my favour.Right, here we go. There’s a World Cup on and Britain is in the middle of a heatwave … ideal conditions for a man in his mid-40s to attempt a gruelling physical challenge, right? With that in mind I take it easy for my first ride – a picturesque six-mile round trip along the Thames from my house in west Oxford, past Christ Church meadow to a pub called the Isis Farmhouse, on Iffley lock to the east of the city.And guess what? I don’t know if it’s because my bike was fresh from a service or whether I’m not quite as unfit as I feared, but when I got back I felt fine. Better than fine: I felt great. So great that I sailed right past my house and continued another couple of miles in the other direction to a pubrestaurant called the Fishes … and my six miles became eight.The next day I repeat the trick, and over the week not only push farther east along the Thames but also follow the river in the opposite direction, as well as striking up north along the Oxford canal past the village of Wolvercote and into the wilds of Oxfordshire.By Friday I’m aching, but it’s a good ache – and when I tot up my total on Sunday I’m a couple miles over what I aimed for, which feels even better. Of course, next week will be 25 miles tougher, and the weeks after that worse still, but for the moment I’m winning.If you’re tempted by life on two wheels, why not make it count? Sign up to Cancer Research UK’s Cycle 300 challenge and cycle 300 miles over the course of September to raise money for life-saving research. Whether you cycle the distance all in one go, over a weekend or throughout the month, every penny you raise will help beat cancer.

With forecasters predicting a return to hot dry weather for the rest of July, we are now at a point where we will need to impose some temporary restrictions on customers.”Soaring summer temperatures have seen utilities companies across England urging customers to be careful about their water usage, but United Utilities is the first to announce a hosepipe ban.The “temporary use ban” will apply to customers in Merseyside, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria, with the exception of Carlisle and north-east Cumbria’s Eden District.Padley said: “It is not a decision we have taken lightly and we are enormously grateful to customers for having helped reduce the demand on our network over the last couple of weeks, but unless we get a period of sustained rainfall before 5 August these restrictions will help us safeguard essential water supplies for longer.” In Northern Ireland, a hosepipe ban has been in effect since 29 June, with an extra 175m litres of water being pumped into the network in an effort to keep up with demand.Other utilities firms – including Severn Trent Water, South Staffs Water, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Bristol Water and Thames Water – all said they were not planning hosepipe bans when contacted on Monday.The ban in north-west England restricts the use of hosepipes or sprinklers for watering private gardens and washing cars but customers will still be able to use watering cans and wash their vehicles with a bucket and sponge, United Utilities said.Sarah Kent, a Met Office meteorologist, said that other than the odd shower there was no significant rainfall expected in the north-west of England during the next week. “There’s a lot of fine and dry weather in the forecast and with the exception of showers, there’s not any significant rainfall expected over the next week,” she said.A hosepipe uses about 540 litres an hour, as much as a family of four would use in one day, while a sprinkler left running overnight uses as much water as that family would use in one week.United Utilities said the ban was alongside the company’s efforts to maintain essential supplies, including maximising water abstraction from groundwater supplies, moving water around its regional integrated network of pipes, and running a campaign to encourage customers to use water wisely. Carlisle and the north-eastern corner of Eden District are exempt because they receive their water from discrete supply network zones fed by local water sources that have not been so badly affected by the overall lack of rainfall, the company said.

Now he’s making a pact with the devil. We go behind the scenes of Philipp Humm’s AI take on Goethe’s damnation epicIn studio six, an actor has stripped to his pants and is waiting to be smeared with blood by two female dancers: one in a black leotard, the other in a white one. He is playing Mephistopheles, the women are interpreting the child-devouring Lamia of Greek myth, and I’m watching day 13 of an unlikely and wildly ambitious film shoot.We’re on a dismal industrial estate in north-west London where Faust, Goethe’s drama of damnation, sexual betrayal, witchcraft and freeform philosophic meditation, is being adapted by Philipp Humm – a man who until three years ago was CEO of Vodafone Europe. Martin Hancock, a former star of Coronation Street, is playing the title role, while the devil is being performed by Glyn Dilley, an actor so versatile that he has played both physicist Isaac Newton in a Fifa video game and Johnnie Cradock in TV comedy Fanny and Friends.Whether what I’m witnessing is an ex-telecom exec’s midlife crisis or on-trend reimagining of Goethe’s epic verse drama for the 21st century is uncertain. Just possibly, it’s both. Certainly, Humm’s adaptation tackles sexual harassment, artificial intelligence, the troubling ethical ramifications of technological innovation, the stuff of a million comment pieces. Humm’s Faust – no longer a medieval doctor-magician but an AI guru who yearns to emulate God by creating life – wears Steve Jobs’ uniform of black turtleneck with blue jeans. His devil is a suited hedge fund trader. There is even an emperor with a short attention . Sounds familiar?Gretchen, the innocent 14-year-old destroyed by the lecherous Faust in Goethe’s play, becomes in Humm’s version a 16-year-old employee of a Silicon Valley startup called Winestone Inc when she is seduced by a sexual predator decades her senior. Winestone, eh? I say to Humm. Can’t imagine what you’re alluding to there. “Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo,” explains Humm.They’re ready to roll. A bucket is filled with blood-red liquid, Yello’s disco number Limbo is cued up to provide the soundtrack, mobiles are turned off, the devil’s in his undies and director Dominik Wieschman is about to shout action.But before he can, there is a problem. “There’s only one white leotard,” says photographer Daniele Mah. Humm, her partner, looks unperturbed. You’d imagine that the 58-year-old Belgian-German tech entrepreneur has faced bigger logistical problems: as head of T-Mobile in the US, he brokered the phone company’s $39bn sale to AT\u0026ampT Inc before anti-trust regulators blocked the deal. Though he retired from full time business in 2015 to become a painter and sculptor, he still sits on boards of investment banks and ad-blocking startup, Shine Technologies.In any case, he will not allow minor wardrobe malfunctions to interfere with the tight schedule he’s set. “People said there’s no way you could shoot 37 scenes in 15 days, but here we are, us greenhorns to the film industry, and we are doing it,” he says. Humm’s shooting script schedules an average of two and a half scenes a day and, ideally, a maximum of three takes per shot. As a businessman, he was noted for his meticulous attention to spreadsheets and is clearly bringing that painstaking, can-do mindset to this multimedia production. Goethe’s drama has been played on stage over 22 hours, he says Humm plans to reduce the action to a 90-minute film. “I insist on it being short. Nobody wants a 22-hour version.” The film is only one element. The hyperreal photographs being made during the shoot by Mah are another. After he’s finished making the film (“I plan to have it ready for distribution by November,” he says), Humm will start making paintings and sculptures of scenes from Faust for exhibition. After that, he plans to publish a book, juxtaposing the photographs with text from Martin Greenberg’s translation of Faust along with Humm’s own narrative links. It could be lucrative, I suggest. “I hope so,” he says. Certainly, Humm could do with incoming cash: he funded the first phase of the Faust project himself, but is looking for backers to help pay for distribution and further development. He won’t tell me how much he’s put into the project so far, but when I suggest he could do with the financial acumen of Mephisto who, Goethe imagines, induces an emperor to float bonds backed by as yet unmined gold from imperial mountains, he doesn’t demur.Humm has dared to go where previous adapters of Faust have feared to tread. True, Jan Švankmajer made a stop-motion animated film of both parts of Faust, and, yes, Gustav Mahler’s Symphony of a Thousand is a setting of part two’s closing section, but artists as varied as Hector Berlioz and Randy Newman are more typical in only adapting part one. “It’s easy to understand why,” says Humm. “Part one is more straightforward. Part two is where Goethe becomes...” He pauses for the right word. “Bonkers?” I suggest. “For me it’s where Goethe’s most philosophically profound.” Before he became a titan of commerce, Humm studied philosophy at Saarland University in the early 1980s immersing himself in German idealism and, in particular, Heidegger’s Being and Time. In his script, lots of his philosophical concerns – what it is to be human, the dangers of technology, the perils of capitalism – are explored. “My favourite stage direction ever,” Dilley tells me between takes, “is the one telling me Mephistopheles is troubled by the Kantian dialectic.” Humm shows me his book of drawings for each of the 37 scenes that works as a storyboard for the film. There’s the time machine that whisks Mephisto and Faust from medieval Germany to ancient Greece. There’s the water tank in which the robot called Homunculus, whom Faust creates, is suspended. There’s the headstone of Marx from Highgate Cemetery superimposed on the body of an angel, symbolising for Humm how the eponymous hero during his existential journey transforms himself from technological innovator to capitalist lackey to communist. It’s quite a ride.Humm has not only updated Faust, but dared to change Goethe’s ending. In Goethe’s original, Faust says “If I ever give up longing, if I’m ever contented, let that day be my last” - and this forms the basis of the wager between God and the devil: when Faust finally admits he is content, Mephisto can claim his soul. So, when near the end Faust does admit he is content, the devil arrives to claim his prize. In Švankmajer’s Faust, when the devil arrives to claim him, Faust panic rushes into the street where he is killed by a car, a trap carries away his severed leg and when a police officer checks the car, he finds it is without a driver.After filming finishes, an actor will perform Humm’s narrative voiceover. “My hope is it will resemble Charles Gray’s in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. We have several big name actors under consideration for the role, but we can’t say yet who will do it.”Humm was inspired to make a film of Faust after seeing an exhibition of Salvador Dali’s paintings depicting scenes from Dante’s Inferno in Florence in 2015. “I thought I could do for Goethe what Dalí does for Dante.” But the impulses goes further back than that. “I was educated in Belgium so I didn’t get my German birthright – knowing Goethe’s Faust – until I was grown up.” When he studied philosophy he thought a lot about what makes humans human and what it is to be authentic, and realised that Goethe’s drama explores these issues.As a young man who loved painting, Humm applied to Berlin’s Academy of Arts but was rejected. It was a pivotal moment: had he been accepted, he might never have become a businessman. Instead, though, painting and sculpting became a sideline. He led a double life: as a painter, he called himself Rudolf Humm in order to distinguish his artistic brand from Philipp Humm, his business persona, and has claimed some success from paintings that mixed art historical works with contemporary references. He has had solo exhibitions at the Saatchi, Riflemaker and Hix galleries in London. His painting Headless Men, depicting men in business suits at a Paris metro station with topless female mannequins in the foreground, had a price tag of £4,000.One critic has called his work “pop expressionism”. In Humm’s version of Manet’s Olympia, the eponymous nude woman is attended by a factotum with David Beckham’s body and Samuel Beckett’s head. In another, Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Madonna and Naomi Campbell eat al fresco. In another, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst tackle Botticelli’s Venus in a life drawing class.Four years ago, Humm quit full-time business to devote himself to art, studying at London’s Fine Arts Studio and the Fine Art Academy in Florence. Like Faust, he’s incessantly creative and ambitious like Mephistopheles, he has in a sardonic eye for human vanity and striving. Who are you more like? “Neither. I’m trying to be creative as an artist. And, incidentally, I was like that in business too. There’s not such a ision between the two worlds in that sense.”He shows me out of the studio block. The leotard problem has been resolved and Humm is giggling. “Fun fact,” he says to me as we shake hands. “One day, my film of Faust will be dubbed from English into German. I’ll be exporting Goethe to Germany!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac08eca5dbb8d119df3ae9da213924c0db74527/0_31_3111_1867/master/3111.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5869452f9ff1550758416cd5096e00a","title":"cristiano ronaldo joins juventus real madrid portugal turin","story":"Even as Cristiano Ronaldo settled in for his first Juventus press conference it somehow did not quite feel real. There he was, flesh and blood, sharp suit and immaculate haircut, grinning and whipping out his phone for a photograph as his family settled into the front row.It was not just a fanciful summer rumour, as the story of his potential move to Juventus had seemed when the first murmurs began to leak out a few weeks ago. It was not a mirage, as he appeared when he touched down at Caselle airport at half-time of the World Cup final, wrongfooting the many fans and journalists expecting him on Sunday morning, not even, as the newspaper Tuttosport had billed him on its front page, “an extra-terrestrial”.Simply he was a 33-year-old footballer with a clear and convincing message about why he had left Real Madrid, where he won four Champions League titles, – three of them in the last three years – to start afresh in Turin.“I want to leave my mark on the history of Juventus,” he said. “This is one of the best teams in the world and I’ve had my mind set on coming here for a little while. They have a great president, a great manager.”Only a club like this could offer a player like him the platform he craved for the next step in his career. “I really want to show that I’m not like the others, that I’m different,” Ronaldo continued. “This is a big club and usually players of my age go to Qatar or to China, with all due respect, so coming to such an important and outstanding club at this point in my career makes me very happy. I’m very grateful to Juventus for this opportunity.”They are equally grateful to have him. How could they not be, with a player who has scored 450 goals since 2009-10 – only four fewer, according to Opta, than all of Juventus’s strikers combined in the same time.Before even kicking a ball Ronaldo has created a buzz around Juventus for which there is no easy comparison in Italian football this century. Within 24 hours of his transfer being made official last Tuesday, Juventus had sold 520,000 shirts with his name on. The club added a million Twitter followers overnight.Turin is known as a reserved city, not prone to overexcitement, yet there was talk of lighting up one of its most famous landmarks, the Mole Antonelliana, with a CR7 logo. Those plans were eventually shelved, together with a gala unveiling for supporters at the Allianz Stadium. No official reason was offered, though the popular hunch was that they had not wanted to convey the impression that any one player was bigger than the team.Instead what we had was 24 hours of hide and seek in Turin. Having arrived early, Ronaldo slipped away immediately to La Mandria Park, an exclusive spot to the north of the city, for dinner with club directors and his entourage.This transfer was all that people here could talk about and yet, with no single event on which to concentrate their enthusiasm, you could also have walked through the centre of Turin on Monday and missed it all. At least until you stopped at a pedestrian crossing and heard an eighty-something couple arguing about what the signing meant for Gonzalo Higuaín or passed the window of the gelateria offering CR7-flavour ice cream.Ronaldo has mostly been kept separate from it all, though there were reports that his arrival at La Mandria did throw one wedding into joyous disarray. He was met by a crowd of 300 or so fans before his medical on Monday morning, and left singing along to their chants – though Italian media were quick to delight in his pronunciation, transforming “Yuve” into “Giuve”.He spoke mostly in Portuguese at his press conference, swapping only to English as he responded to a question from the  – or, rather, sidestepped it. Asked how it felt on a personal level – rather than a footballing one – to be embarking on a new adventure in a new country, Ronaldo quickly found his way back to the pitch. “I feel great, for me it is another challenge,” he said. “I know it will be tough. I will be ready, Juve is ready.”He has been around too long, done too many of these, to be drawn away from the things he wants to discuss. Yet there was sincerity in the words he did share. Ronaldo spoke like a man who was genuinely excited to have such an opportunity to test himself anew at this late stage of his career. He stressed that he was not thinking about any specific trophies that he needed to win, nor of personal rivalries, saying: “I just want think of me in the present tense.”From his seat at the podium Ronaldo seemed at once bullet-proof and vulnerable, a five-times Ballon d’Or winner with no shortage of confidence in his ability yet a keen awareness that opportunities like this will not be around forever. “I’m not 23, I’m 33,” he said at one point – a fascinating contrast with his insistence in an interview months earlier that his commitment to hard work and eating right had given him a “biological age of 23”.At another moment, though, he contradicted himself again, insisting, “I’m still rather young.” In Turin, for now, they will settle for knowing he is really here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19cc7ce2af7ebaa5db965b968bee80c01fefd0ed/76_145_4144_2487/master/4144.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36ed2f2fcd870170c0d21056d7d1683","title":"doubted to dominator paul pogbas world cup evolution","story":"If ever there was a time for Paul Pogba to dab and dance, to snapchat and sing to his heart’s content without giving a soul with any sense the opportunity even to tut, this was it. With Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium his stage, he dabbed with president Macron. He dabbed with his mother and brothers on the pitch. He dabbed with an iconic 36.8cm piece of sculpted gold that means everything in football. A world champion, a scorer of a goal that felt result-defining in the final, a fulcrum for his team, a massive personality revered back home, the only thing missing was a hairdresser on hand to create a World Cup-shaped cut to mark this most glorious of moments.With Pogba in his exuberant element – the master of social media filming non-stop in the dressing room, on the bus, encouraging all sorts of celebratory flourishes with his band of World Cup-winning brothers – he felt so central to everything about this French generation. During the course of this tournament his status within the group changed, and even for his own teammates it was difficult to articulate exactly what it was and how it happened. But everyone could feel it. “I can tell you that Paul Pogba, I don’t know how and I don’t know from where, has become a leader,” announced Adil Rami. “He proved it to us. He showed it. He’s the one that showed the way. He was the strong man of the France team.”His evolution during this tournament into a new kind of force for Les Bleus, able to use his power, his presence and his technical skill set with an enhanced sense of responsibility and focus, is symbolic of how this team clicked into serious contenders during their month in Russia.Pogba being Pogba, when France arrived for this World Cup his role in the side was being debated. Polemics about his more enigmatic characteristics, the search for a way to get him to play his best and how to fit him in the tactical scheme of things, bubbled from the off. The scene was not unfamiliar as Didier Deschamps looked tense when lobbed questions on the subject before a ball had even been kicked or an anthem sung.Kazan. France’s opening group game against Australia was not particularly convincing. The team laboured. They lacked creativity and cohesion. Still, Pogba influenced the outcome more than most. A clever through-ball opened the game up to produce a penalty for their first goal – an assist of sorts – before he prompted and finished the move for the winner (later given as an own goal). Post-match the Pogba inquisition started anew, prompting him to defend himself by batting away the negative vibes.“I am less entitled to make mistakes than others,” he mused. “I went from the biggest transfer in the world to the most criticised player in the world. Criticism is always here. When I was little, with my friends we always used to take the piss out of each other, saying: ‘You were good, you were bad.’ It’s about what happens on the pitch and I treat the criticism like I did when I was playing on the block as a kid. I never listen to it. I’m having fun and that’s the only answer I can give to all those people who criticise me or who think I am this or that.”Into the knockouts Pogba became more and more influential. The critics in general grew quieter and quieter. Against Argentina he enjoyed himself as France glided through the creative gears. Against Uruguay he helped his team to control the game and minimise pressure. Against Belgium he was strong and disciplined, supporting the defensive work with a mix of aggression and diligence. Pogba showed many facets to his game, able to do what was needed in different situations.The connections he was making on the pitch became stronger. His bond with N’Golo Kanté flourished as a central midfield pair, though it was less effective in the final when Kanté strained to be his usual self. His instinctive understanding with Kylian Mbappé, as exemplified by that ravishing goal when they combined brilliantly as the teenager bounded on to Pogba’s sumptuous pass to ensure the final is remembered for some dazzling football as well as the strokes of first-half luck, is another major plus France take home from this tournament. As souvenirs go, a goal and an assist from that period of play will rightly be cherished by Pogba.15 July. There was Pogba’s face, illuminating one of the uprights of the Arc de Triomphe alongside the face of Zinedine Zidane adorning the other. For Pogba this is a powerful thing, linked to his own memories of the 1998 World Cup winners which is entwined with his love for his late father, Fassou Antoine. “I think about 1998, when I watched a video tape of the World Cup with my father, at home, on repeat,” he said. “We would watch it the entire time. Now I am a world champion. I miss my father. He is watching us. I think he would be very proud. This is for him.”In the aftermath of it all Rio Ferdinand, with his Manchester United hat on, was quick to point to the challenge for his club to find a way to allow this version of Pogba, a more consistent dominator, to shine more at Old Trafford. But that is for another day. For now Pogba can deservedly express his French happiness any way he likes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48aff6dc47abf987732b9f7abe27f236d54ee295/0_189_3516_2110/master/3516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a815c33afdca0e3890c45d48ed300948","title":"weeks endless drama russia re energised world cup","story":"After a tournament that was gripping from start to finish with thrilling matches, marvellous midfielders, the rebirth of England and VAR controversy, Qatar has a lot to live up toThank you Russia, and goodbye! It’s been fun. Not to mention epic, thrilling, dazzlingly well-organised, and with a constantly shifting sense of place from the strangulating heat of Samara, to the fly-marshes of Volgograd, to the mist and drizzle of the north.But that is now a wrap. After four and a half weeks and 64 matches, 1,613 shots, 1,734 fouls and a shared continental-scale avalanche of herring, beetroot, dumplings, vodka and sustained on-field drama, the World Cup can now be packed away for the next four years.It is tempting in the immediate glow to call this the greatest modern tournament. Certainly Gianni Infantino and friends have been energetically congratulating themselves. On the eve of Sunday’s final the swanky Arbat embankment was buzzing. This is where Fifa based itself for Russia 2018, with an HQ at the Stalin-does-Disney Radisson Royal, the tallest hotel in the world when it opened in 1957, and host these days to its own fleet of river yachts.On the strip outside the Royal on Saturday night an armed military escort lounged in its supercharged Mercedes jeep, next to the plain-clothes security in the Cadillac Escalade, just down from the black-out Maybachs, part of a £2m haul of luxury cars lined up waiting for their passengers to eat a pizza.Inside the Qatar 2022 committee could be seen enjoying a pre-final dinner that looked more like a celebration. Understandably so. Russia 2018, the other half of the late-Blatter two-hander, has been a wonderful success, a World Cup that has both re-geared international football’s juggernaut status and reinforced Fifa’s authority as keeper of the spectacle.Around the same time Infantino was across town on stage at the ballet cooing and fawning over Vladimir Putin. “This World Cup is changing the perception of Russia, particularly from us in the west. Even the police are smiling!” Fifa’s president gushed, a political statement for which he will now presumably fine himself heavily.Infantino is right to be bullish though. The World Cup will head to the Gulf looking relevant and purposeful, beneficiary once again of football’s ability to re-energise itself no matter what its governing bodies throw at this great belching circus of global interests.On the pitch Russia 2018 was beautifully gripping from first to final whistle. The only caveat would be the absence of one or two obviously great national teams, although it is possible this young French squad might change that perception in years to come.Overall Belgium scored the most goals. Russia committed an astonishing 95 fouls in five matches. Right up to the final weekend Spain had made the most passes despite exiting at the first knockout stage. England led the world on passes backwards. Neymar overcame his constant sufferings to have the most shots, 27 in all. By way of contrast Kylian Mbappé had just six before the final.At the end of which France were admirable champions, a team culled from the beautifully fecund academy system and cast in the fanatically team-oriented shape of their coach. It seems likely that in Mbappé France also finessed a little further the outstanding attacking player of the next decade.Although this wasn’t a tournament for stars. Instead the struggles of the World Cup’s herd of would-be GOATS provided another layer in the daily drama and a refreshing shift away from club football’s cult of personality.The constant TV close-ups of Lionel Messi’s Sad Face, his utter bafflement at not being about to rouse a team of lesser talents the wretched theatricals of Neymar the inability of the great C-Ron to drag Portugal along under his arm: all of this was a gripping counter-narrative to football’s standard seasonal star fest.Instead organised western European nations thrived, with Sweden, Switzerland, England, Belgium and Denmark leaving some kind of imprint. African football remained stuck in the blocks, with an apparent deficit in prep and organisation and support staff.The slaying of various stricken giants added early depth. Germany and Spain seemed trapped within their own methods, hampered in both cases by a failing manager: Julen Lopetegui’s sacking and Jogi Löw’s vagueness.Endless drama was the key. There were very few of the dull games that can dog the group stages. The last 16 and quarter-finals were often tight and taut to the end. France 4-3 Argentina, Brazil 1-2 Belgium and Croatia 2-1 England felt like authentic World Cup matches.Tactically this was a tournament with little in the way of innovation or fine-point embroidery. The usual dance between possession football and counterattack was played out. But international football is too rushed, too brown-paper-and-string to feature much in the way of real planning. The most notable change of gear was the emphasis on set-piece goals, the easiest thing to coach in a hurry and the hardest to defend on the hoof.If there was a dominant texture to the play Russia 2018 was perhaps the tournament of the central midfielder, with Luka Modric, Paul Pogba, Philippe Coutinho, N’Golo Kanté and Kevin De Bruyne among the outstanding players, less so the goalscorers or attacking playmakers.Chief irritation was the constant play-acting and writhing about holding the wrong body part, no doubt driven in part by hope of a favourable VAR referral. Talking of which, a word on VAR here: rubbish. Actually that’s unfair. VAR works best the less it’s used and clearly has a place. But it can be dreadful when overdone, or used as a piece of big-match vanity refereeing.Russia itself was a multilayered joy and also, of course, an enigma and all-round riddle wrapped up in a crab-flavoured crisp packet. The promised pummelling with knuckledusters failed to materialise. Instead everyday Russians were curious, amused and often kind. Russia may have scrubbed up to face the world, and undoubtedly has plenty of issues unaddressed by a football tournament, but there is a warmth to this huge, piecemeal, slightly bonkers nation that suited the oddity of a World Cup.These events have their own energy too. The sight of Peruvians and Senegalese waving flags in former Soviet city centres and singing football songs outside the Kremlin is striking in itself. Who knows what ripples might be felt.Finally on to England, and the fevered micro-climate of joy and giddiness that greeted Gareth and his boys. In retrospect a likable, hard-working team performed well against opposition at their level but didn’t have the class to beat those above.The best part was the public engagement, although watching the reaction in England from a distance was a strange experience. The gushing BBC news reports about players “carrying a nation in their hands – but still taking time to go grocery shopping!” over an adoring shot of Harry Kane holding a plastic bag. The sense of a nation in the grip of some unbearably sensual excitement, through to the sudden end with its slight feeling of come-down. They’re selling Southgate wigs in Woolworth’s. And for now the greatest English World Cup adventure of the last 28 years is over.The fond memories will remain, as they will of a wonderful four weeks. Even the final was fascinating, with a weirdly aggressive closing ceremony featuring flag bearers of all nations dancing angrily to house music. A man called Nicky performed an inappropriately suggestive rap routine in an inappropriately heavy tog bomber jacket. Ronaldinho played the bongos. And France and Croatia dished up the most goals since Wembley ’66.In its wake this grand old overblown competition feels energised. The World Cup trophy had arrived at the Luzhniki Stadium escorted by Philipp Lahm and someone described by the PA as a “philanthropist and supermodel” (same).On the touchline it was unpacked from its case with the usual weirdly sensual air of longing. The fetishising of the trophy itself – purring and leering at it as though in the presence of some magical relic – has been a theme of modern Fifa.In Russia it felt apt after a month where the sense of madness and longing and scale returned. This was a reminder of sport’s basic fun, not to mention its ability to offer a degree of escapism in odd and fractured times. Qatar, with its winter sun, its tiny footprint, has a great deal to live up to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d54c640972e67e3a0182c5ef47a0f20b587bafc/0_15_2995_1797/master/2995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=884a5f1fb1aa2d210c3abdd3d9d16a78","title":"world cup 2018 guardian writers highs lows modric pavard russia","story":"From Modric’s magic and Pavard’s screamer to unwelcome theatrics and wearing the wrong T-shirt, our writers give their take on the tournament in RussiaMatch of the tournament Russia v Croatia had it all: a spectacular goal from Denis Cheryshev, unbearable tension during a see-sawing extra-time period, raucous celebrations when Mário Fernandes equalised and then shootout heartache for the hosts – followed quickly by an acknowledgment that they should hold their heads high.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. He was influential from the first game but by extra time of the Croatia v England game it was impossible to take your eyes off him. Modric has played more fluently but the way he dragged himself and his team through against the odds was breathtaking.Goal of the tournament It seems a long time ago now but Ricardo Quaresma’s trademark “trivela” for Portugal against Iran was a luscious piece of skill that bears watching time and again.Personal highlight It sounds a bit mawkish but watching the sun rise over Kazan Arena from my apartment, only a few hours after seeing France beat Argentina 4-3 there in a stunning game of football, gave rise to a feeling of immense gladness simply to be here. Nobody would take covering this tournament for granted.Biggest disappointment That we did not see a more erse tournament from the quarter-finals onwards. Europe’s primacy was disconcerting and, while we may have to wait to see if it is a trend, not entirely surprising. It was a regret off the pitch, too, because the vibrancy that tens of thousands of Latin American fans brought to the early stages was one of the aspects that made this month special.Trickiest off-field moment The weight of responsibility has rarely felt heavier than when, having booked a minibus to take yours truly and seven colleagues from Kazan to Samara in time for England v Sweden, the vehicle arrived an hour and 20 minutes late. That was the good news. A confused driver, who had somehow got lost en route to our apartment, then emerged and explained that (a) the sound on his sat nav had packed in and (b) he didn’t know the way to Samara anyway. At this point the risk of blank column inches across several of the UK’s major organs looked severe but, with the help of our phones and a rotation of front-seat assistants, we just about muddled through the six-hour journey in time to cover the quarter-final.Fondest memory of Russia Less a specific memory than simple pleasure that visiting supporters and locals interacted so joyfully and saw each other’s best sides. In regional cities such as Samara and Volgograd, particularly, one could see just how much it meant to people who had never experienced anything like this before the only shame is that so few fans from western Europe, in particular, felt emboldened to join in.What now for England? The good feeling of this summer must be bottled because normality will kick in soon and the reality is that, if England are to succeed, they need to ensure the best players are given a workable pathway to the top. The current crop are decent but not good enough to lift major trophies: until top clubs’ development processes tilt in favour of the players that will remain the case.Match of the tournament Portugal 3-3 Spain, a game which set the bar high for the tournament and probably gave both teams false hope as to their own capabilities in Russia. Cristiano Ronaldo was a force of nature, Spain pinged their passes and looked irrepressible and an upbeat tone was set for everything that followed. The World Cup, if not necessarily Spain and Portugal, lived up to expectations thereafter.Player of the tournament Eden Hazard. The Premier League has long grown accustomed to the Belgian’s genius but here he was illuminating the world stage. He provided goals, assists and mesmeric dribbles and will have been privately disappointed to finish only third, even if his declaration that his time at Chelsea may be up was a sting in the tail. Goal of the tournament Right-backs had some fun in Russia. Take your pick between Nacho’s goal, skimmed in off both posts, against Portugal and Benjamin Pavard’s stunning reward against Argentina.Personal highlight Jordan Pickford’s save from Carlos Bacca, and Eric Dier claiming a penalty shootout for England. Followed closely by the glory of The Motherland Calls and the Stalingrad memorial.Biggest disappointment Argentina, who I had bafflingly suggested might win the tournament. There was no pace, no energy and far too much reliance on Lionel Messi. They were fortunate to escape the group and beaten more convincingly by France than the 4-3 scoreline suggested.Trickiest off-field moment The flies, the flies, the flies of Volgograd, who swarmed all day off the Volga marshes. Oh, and the mosquitoes of Repino, who came out with a vengeance at dusk. My God, they loved me as much as I detested them. They will not be missed. That said, vanilla oil was a bit of a find, and more pleasant than DEET.Fondest memory of Russia St Petersburg. An incredible city, a glorious blend of Paris, Vienna and Amsterdam, with a dash of Scandinavia thrown in. It was heartening to see England’s players making the most of their days off to visit its sights, from the Hermitage to the Winter Palace, via the fairground.What now for England? For once England leave a tournament in a promising place. They have a plan, a manager with a vision and a crop of young players waiting in the wings to make their mark. The Nations League, which starts in the autumn, will not be straightforward but it could cultivate the renewed interest in international football. The World Cup was all about progress. Now they must maintain it.Match of the tournament Portugal v Spain.Player of the tournament Eden Hazard.Goal of the tournament Benjamin Pavard against Argentina.Trickiest off-field moment Because England did so well and Gareth Southgate became so popular, I was asked to wear a waistcoat in the TV studio. The crew were really excited about it but I wasn’t happy at all. I decided against it. Fortunately, they kept me on until the last day …Fondest memory I went to Volgograd before the World Cup and was overwhelmed, having visited the Mamayev Hill monuments and Rossoschka, a Russian-German military cemetery. It was a history lesson like I’ve never experienced.What now for England? Keep the team spirit alive and practise more possession and fewer set pieces.Match of the tournament Belgium v Brazil. For Belgium’s counterattacking masterclass in the first half and the breakneck drama after the interval. The pace and intensity were incredible.Player of the tournament I loved the way Paul Pogba handled himself but Luka Modric was the stand-out performer. I have long thought he was the finest central midfielder in world football and he oozed class and control. Showed his courage to step up in the last-16 shootout against Denmark, having missed a penalty in extra time.Goal of the tournament Toni Kroos v Sweden. OK, it seriously messed with me on deadline but the intelligence, technique and execution, with Germany’s World Cup hopes on the line, were extraordinary. I thought it would spark Germany into life. I was wrong.Personal highlight So many. Here are some. Watching Brazil live. Enjoying Tite (Cheechee). Being there for Mário Fernandes’s equaliser. Having a stroll in Gorky Park and Neskuchny Garden. People watching on Novy Arbat. Being on a fan bus packed with Colombians when the Colombia team bus overtook. Meeting Carlos Valderrama. Finding out what a good bloke Dejan Lovren is. The emotion at the final.Biggest disappointment Neymar was the coolest kid in the world at Brazil 2014. I remember him doing keepie-uppies as he strolled out for a training session and looking as though he did not have a care – as 200 million Brazilians invested their dreams in him. The king turned into a princess here. His theatrics did him no credit.Trickiest off-field moment My first full day was in Rostov-on-Don, where I was covering Brazil v Switzerland. I had to get to the stadium for the press conferences. There was no tube. I could not get an uber, yandex or regular cab. I had not yet discovered the game-changer that was the Google translate app. I was completely stuck and it was a horrible feeling. I would be saved by a big-hearted couple, whom I had met the night before, and they drove me to the stadium. It set a good tone.Fondest memory of Russia My take-away was the heartfelt desire of Russian people for their country to be appreciated. Every single Russian I met in every single city ran through the same questions. What do you think of Russia? What do you think of our city? And, invariably, what do you think of our women? It mattered to them that visitors departed with different perceptions. Moscow is now one of my top five cities.What now for England? Quite simply, to enjoy the positivity for as long as it lasts.Match of the tournament Belgium 3-2 Japan. I expected Belgium to stroll to victory but Japan were absolutely terrific. When Japan went 2-0 up, through Takashi Inui’s superb goal, James Ducker, from the , and I looked at each other in the press box as if to say: ‘What on earth is happening here?’ Belgium, to give credit where it is due, responded brilliantly. What a way to win the match, too – the best counterattacking goal I’ve ever seen.Player of the tournament Hard to look beyond Luka Modric, who has been so influential for Croatia in what will surely be his last World Cup, but let’s not ignore the contribution of N’Golo Kanté, even if the Frenchman would quite happily go under the radar. Kylian Mbappé deserves a mention too – he is going to be a superstar, if he isn’t already.Goal of the tournament Spoilt for choice. Benjamin Pavard’s strike against Argentina was tremendous. I also liked Nacho’s goal for Spain in their thrilling 3-3 draw with Portugal – what technique again. But I’m plumping for Denis Cheryshev’s second against Saudi Arabia. Elegantly stroked into the top corner with the outside of his left boot, it was a thing of beauty and set the tone for this World Cup.Personal highlight Watching and reporting on England in their first World Cup semi-final since 1990, when I was 14 years old. I never imagined for a minute that I’d find myself in that situation when I left for Russia. And what a moment when Kieran Trippier’s free-kick hit the back of the net. Let’s just not go there with what happened later.Biggest disappointment The amount of play-acting but in particular Neymar’s rolling around. It was embarrassing watching him at times and sad, too, given his talent. He’s not alone, though, and it has got to the stage where Fifa needs to confront the issue head-on. Sadly, it will probably ignore it.Trickiest off-field moment I could write a book on this one. I got lost quite a lot and didn’t master the metro in Moscow until day 30 (I went home the following morning). Getting in and out of the hammock in my apartment in Sochi was testing. And I somehow ended up with five courses after ordering soup for lunch in Saransk. Thank heavens for Google translate, which prevented more buffoonery like that and became my best friend.Fondest memory of Russia So many to choose from but I’d probably say walking to the Mordovia Arena in Saransk for Peru’s first World Cup game in 36 years. I remember turning this corner and seeing thousands and thousands of red and white shirts stretching as far as the eye could see. They were marching, singing, laughing and smiling – having the time of their lives. It was an extraordinary sight and gives me goose bumps whenever I think about it.What now for England? The balance doesn’t feel right in midfield and that showed against Croatia, so Gareth Southgate has got some work to do there. But let’s just be positive: there’s a feelgood factor that hasn’t been there for ages. Heck, I’d quite like to take my son to an England game now and I never thought I’d say that.Match of tournament I watched the group match between Spain v Portugal in a poky hotel room in Volgograd on a 13-inch TV made at least a couple of decades ago. But even that could not dampen the enjoyment of a game for the ages. It lived up to all the hype. As for that Ronaldo free-kick at the end, he just knew he was going to score. Incredible.Player of tournament Eden Hazard may not have reached the final but he was consistently brilliant for Belgium, turning in three man-of-the-match performances. He was still captivating his audience in the mixed zone after the third-place play-off, all but announcing that he wanted out of Chelsea.Goal of tournament Might be slightly coloured by the fact I saw it live but Jesse Lingard’s 25-yard curler against Panama – his first international goal – was a stunner. Yes, the opposition were limited and England were already well on their way to a rout but after watching him having lumps taken out of him all afternoon it was a welcome, beautiful interruption. Personal highlight Being inside Spartak Stadium to witness England finally win a penalty shootout. You try to remain impartial as a journalist but you also report what you experience and it’s impossible not to have felt some of Gareth Southgate’s joy that evening. He said afterwards he’d never get over the penalty miss at Euro 96 but you hope leading a team to a penalty shootout victory eased the burden.Biggest disappointment That Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could not assert themselves more on the tournament. But that blow was softened by the emergence of another superstar in Kylian Mbappé.Trickiest off field moment Getting stuck in some pretty epic match-day traffic in Kaliningrad before England played Belgium there. We were still for half an hour about three miles from the stadium with the clock ticking closer to kick-off. Cue abandoning my taxi, hiring a bike from a nearby shop and cycling to the stadium over the main highway, which mercifully they had shut for the afternoon.Fondest memory of Russia Meeting a 17-year-old girl waitressing at a restaurant in Samara, a city 1,000km south-east of Moscow. When I told her I was from London, she could not contain her excitement. She wanted to know everything about England and we’re now friends on social media. In fact this whole trip has been a reminder not to confuse people with politics. Particularly the younger generation of Russians have been friendly, inquisitive and so welcoming.What now for England? To continue progressing, to blood new talent such as Ryan Sessegnon and Phil Foden. And to use the knowledge that Euro 2020 will feel somewhat like a home tournament, with seven games at Wembley, to train their sights on the future.Match of the tournament France 4-3 Argentina. If your heart didn’t soar at the sight of what Kylian Mbappé did here, you’ve no business watching sport (Argentinians excepted). The interweaving storylines, high emotions, brilliant goals, passing of batons and lurching drama made for an all-time classic. Player of the tournament Mulling this over in the days before the final the cases for Luka Modric and Mbappé felt particularly strong. Not much changed there during the final – both are absolutely deserving of the highest accolades – but something about Paul Pogba, the way he has commanded games, made his mark, played his role so emphatically for the team, and influenced the final swung it.Goal of the tournament Welcome to the old screamer versus purity of technique versus team goal dilemma. Belgium’s match-winner against Japan was seriously impressive especially in the context of a match they were trailing 2-0. Lionel Messi’s cushioned second touch against Nigeria is a thing of beauty in itself. Benjamin Pavard’s lasered volley just about gets my nod. Personal highlight Away from the stadiums, being in the evocatively named Snob Bar in Kazan riveted to the 3-3 humdinger between Spain and Portugal accompanied by high-speed house music and a guy lolling around in a giant polar bear costume for no obvious reason. In the stadium, seeing the Swedes and Mexicans start an impromptu dance-off to their “Bye Bye Germany” song after the dramatic, topsy-turvy ending to Group F. Biggest disappointment Not being able to lay my hands on a “Rock Arsenal” T-shirt – Ekaterinburg’s finest radio station, don’t you know – despite an extensive hunt. Trickiest off-field moment Trying to survive 90 minutes of Japan v Senegal sitting next to someone who had absolutely no idea how to manage some seriously intense body odour. Fondest memory of Russia Peruvians. They seemed to be everywhere I went. Watching the world go by from the banks of the Iset River in Ekaterinburg, somewhere I doubt I would have ever ventured to without this World Cup, was lovely and of course enhanced by little groups of wandering Peruvians. What now for England? Creativity. Find it, nurture it, encourage it, use it. A culture of doing well in tournaments is now in place across the age groups. Adding finesse at senior level is the missing ingredient that could make a telling difference. Match of the tournament Spain 3-3 Portugal, my first game, was quite a way to start a tournament in which I seemed to get lucky often (confession time: journalists don’t always feel “lucky” exactly when games are dramatic and decided by late goals). Even Switzerland-Serbia, supposedly a nice quiet night, turned out grand. Argentina-Nigeria inside the ground was quite something. But the best games were not mine. Enjoyed Belgium-Brazil (and, unfashionably, I think Brazil were good). But my favourite was probably Belgium-Japan. Player of the tournament Rakitic? Kanté? Mbappé? I’m leaning towards Eden Hazard and Luka Modric, not least because in true sports journalism style this judgment is being delivered before it’s actually over. In honour of this World Cup, could another rewrite be on the way after the final? Yes, it could. He may not have been the best but when it comes to what actually happened over the month, the things that players actually did, the impact they had, the effectiveness, the key moments, then Antoine Griezmann. Goal of the tournament 1. Cheryshev. 2. Cheryshev. 3. Cheryshev. OK, OK, it’s actually Toni Kroos or, better still, Belgium’s winner against Japan. Only it’s not for me: see also ‘personal highlight’, below.Personal highlight Watching the brutal beauty of Edinson Cavani’s goal against Portugal, a 100-metre one-two between him and Luis Suárez, the ball smashed from one side of the pitch to the other and back again, before flying in off Cavani’s face. Inside a stadium, I’ve rarely been hit – and it really did feel as if you’d been hit – by a goal quite like that. And then there’s Felipe Baloy scoring for Panama. Wonderful. Biggest disappointment In a word: Spain. Also, from a cynical point of view, I can’t help wondering what might have been for Belgium and Uruguay in the other half of the draw – two teams I would have liked to see reach a final. Off the pitch: not really getting the chance to experience Moscow which, when I was all too briefly acquainted with it, looked great. Or England-Colombia, for that matter.Trickiest off-field moment Being in A\u0026ampE worryingly close to kick off on England’s semi-final but I had left Russia by then so that probably doesn’t count. A cup, two tea bags, a tea spoon and no kettle: eh? The couple we thought had departed the restaurant and headed home returning just as we were ‘borrowing’ the still almost-full bottle of wine they had (or had not) left behind. Or how about the very, very first moment? Land in Moscow late, switch phone on ... Lopetegui’s done what, now?!  Fondest memory of RussiaMatch-day cakes in the hotel, of course. Football street lights. 2am sunrises and walking through St Petersburg at dawn.What now for England? Carry on, while recognising the reality beneath the feel-good factor. (England’s World Cup record is actually remarkably consistent.) Play, and try to play: there is plenty to be positive about. Be nice still. Nice is good. And nice doesn’t have to come last. Match of the tournament Maybe just because I was there, but I haven’t been more viscerally thrilled by a game for a long time than Belgium v Japan. If anything summed up the strangeness of this World Cup, it was a knockout game being turned round by Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. To play as well as he has would be remarkable under normal circumstances, but to do so with the looming prospect of a trial on his mind has been astounding.Goal of the tournament Christian Eriksen’s against Australia was probably the best I saw live, but just because it was so unusual I loved Benjamin Pavard’s against Argentina.Personal highlight The game wasn’t hugely memorable in the end but I was at Brazil v Switzerland. Watching Brazil at a World Cup is like visiting some sort of venerated monument: often not that impressive on the face of it but the history and stories behind it are inescapable.Biggest disappointment Morocco. I got swept up in gushing pre-tournament predictions and thought they might embarrass Portugal andor Spain, but their performances turned out to be akin to a limp bit of lettuce.Trickiest off-field moment It was broadly fine, other than the scandalous confiscation of my deodorant at the Luzhniki. Oh, and I was also stopped at a metro station and instructed to produce my passport, which I did not have on me. Brief visions of a future at Vladimir’s Big House flashed before my eyes but my press pass turned out to satisfy the lust for admin.Fondest memory of Russia People dancing in the Moscow streets after Russia beat Spain. The impromptu party that formed around a busking, instrumental post-rock band in a park was a particular highlight.What now for England? Here’s a hot take for you: I genuinely don’t know. In theory it should be bright, a talented young team due to be supplemented by further promising young talent coming through, but how often do theories work out in international football? I fear this will turn out to be one of those long, hot, strange summers that will feel as if it didn’t happen in a few years.Match of the tournament In the flesh, Spain versus Russia. Perhaps the most lop-sided match I’ve ever seen and one of the oddest. Sensible people will point to the fact Spain lost their manager and just didn’t play their system well. But still hard not to wax on about the limits of possession football and the weird agony of watching Spain pass the ball. Plus of course the hysteria of Russia and penalties.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. Best player for a tiny nation in the final. Ran further, aged 32, than any other player at the World Cup except his teammate Ivan Perisic. But of course it’s about the craft with Modric and his ability to drag a game his team’s way was of the highest class. Put him in five or six other teams here and they could have made the final too. Goal of the tournament Ricardo Qaresma for the one-off trivela-style curler, a wonderful piece of inidual skill he keeps on doing year after year. And Belgium in the last minute against Japan for the ultimate high-pressure team goal, made by Kevin De Bruyne’s laser-pass and Romelu Lukaku’s dummy.Personal highlight The absence of any fighting or trouble, not to mention mind games, wars of words, handshake-refusals or anything much apart from the football.Biggest disappointment Get a grip Brazil. This was once a team of tough guys, charmers and rogues. Nílton Santos, Jairzinho, Romário, Leônidas and Carlos Alberto are turning in their graves watching the current ing, weeping lot. And half of them aren’t even dead.Trickiest off-field moment After a lot of early running around – five flights in three days, five games in six days – I did briefly fall asleep on a stool in an airport departure lounge. When I woke up I couldn’t remember with any real certainty what city I was in. I looked at my boarding pass, but I wasn’t sure if it was the right one. Eventually asked someone.Fondest memory of Russia Football, people, meat, beer, beetroot, wide streets, huge buildings, all-night bars, amazing supermarkets and the busking folk dance duo from some conservatoire who popped up on the street in Moscow one night and performed an astonishing routine for a few roubles in a hat. This is from someone for whom the words “amazing folk dance” don’t exactly trip off the tongueWhat now for England? Fifty years of hurt.Match of the tournament Spain-Portugal kicked this tournament into high gear. Spain at moments played the best football of any country at the World Cup and both sides scored lovely goals, capped by Cristiano Ronaldo hiking up his shorts and curling that free-kick round the Spanish wall in injury time. Very satisfying draw.Player of the tournament Likely this should go to a defender or even a goalkeeper, but I will opt for Kylian Mbappé, whose speed has been dazzling. Goal of the tournament Toni Kroos’s free-kick. Set pieces played a central role and this one was their king: a beautiful strike from an impossible angle executed with cool German precision. The gif of this winner (with Marco Reus’s reaction) is mesmerising. Also an honorary mention to Denis Cheryshev’s goal against Croatia best Russian strike since Battleship Potemkin. Personal highlight This would have to be the citywide bacchanal after Russia’s shock win over Spain on penalties. Moscow is an extraordinary city but is not the world’s friendliest. Seeing a riot policeman politely tell a fan by the Bolshoi to stop spraying champagne on passers-by captured the spirit of this night for me.Biggest disappointment Denmark versus France. Any chance to give players a rest at a tournament must be hard to pass up for a manager but it’s a shame for fans to pay hundreds of dollars each to go and watch a match that neither team came to play.Trickiest off-field moment Balancing politics and sport as a Moscow-based journalist. Many fans blamed the English media for scare stories about Russia before the tournament, although I suspect they’re referring more to tabloid headlines than our coverage. In any case we should have nuance in our discussion of Russia, one that can acknowledge an excellent World Cup while recognising that it does not portray all aspects of life in this country. Fondest memory of Russia South and Central American fans invading Moscow in a riot of colour and realising that we had a whole month with them in town.What now for England? I learned during the tournament that Pizza Hut once dedicated an entire commercial to England’s penalties problem. How great then that a young squad with years of play ahead of them have banished that particular demon. I’m not sure if football can come home during the Euros, but I look forward to finding out in 2020. Match of the tournament Spain 3-3 Portugal. Everything: wonder goals, Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick and so early in the competition it left the clear sense we were in for a special tournament.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. The crowd’s reaction when he was named as the Golden Ball winner told its own story. One of those players – and they are rare – you always want on the ball. Goal of the tournament Cristiano Ronaldo (the third one) v Spain. He blew out his cheeks. He hitched up his shorts. He knew damn well the world was watching. And then he put it in the top corner, past one of the greatest goalkeepers I have ever seen. Honorary mentions to Nacho (from the same game) and Benjamin Pavard (France v Argentina).Personal highlight Seeing Russia in a new light (and yes, I know there’s another issue entirely when it’s not on its best behaviour), collecting my ticket for the final (always a privilege), beating Jamie Vardy at pool in a Nottingham Forest v Leicester City grudge match (in my head, anyway) and the little bits of spare time to look around St Petersburg and Moscow properly.Biggest disappointment Not having time to look around properly and – this might surprise you – seeing so little football. That’s the problem when you are on the England beat: you tend to be in press conferences, writing against deadlines or mid-air (19 flights) when the other games are on. After 22 days in Russia I’d watched three live matches.Trickiest off-field moment 1) The waitress in my hotel in Volgograd who didn’t speak a word of English and signalled that she would get a colleague to come over, then did a slit-eye gesture to show who she meant. What do you say? 2) The high-ranking FA official pointing out (with great suspicion) my Fjallraven T-shirt had a Sweden flag as its label. Five minutes before kick-off, England v Sweden.Fondest memory of Russia How much Moscow has changed since I first came here with Leeds in 1999 and again for the Champions League final in 2008. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a city where there isn’t a single spot of litter. St Petersburg, too. In five weeks I’ve seen one homeless person. It makes me despair when I think of Manchester, Liverpool, London and the numbers on the streets back home.What now for England? I’m torn. They were within half an hour of the final. Yet they also lost three out of seven games and seem incapable of beating any of the top teams. It wasn’t arrogant to say they were in the easier half of the draw, it was factual. Euro 2020 looks inviting, with both semi-finals and the final at Wembley, but I think England have blown the best chance they will ever get.Match of the tournament Belgium 2-1 Brazil.Player of the tournament Luka Modric.Goal of the tournament The collective move on the third Belgium goal against Japan.Personal highlight The madness provoked by Russia’s victory over Spain.Trickiest off-field moment The sacking of Julen Lopetegui two days before the start of the World Cup.Fondest memory of Russia Russia itself: a fascinating country.What now for England? Complete the journey they have just begun.Match of the tournament The match I enjoyed the most was Iran v Portugal, because of the intense late drama. A 93rd-minute equaliser for Iran and then a stunning chance to win it in the 96th minute. Had Mehdi Taremi scored rather than hit the side-netting, Portugal would have been flying home and Iran would have won the group. The kind of tiny margin on which World Cup runs are decided.Player of the tournament Luka Modric, for his own performances and for leading his Croatia team to the final. I watched Croatia’s first game, against Nigeria, and although they were largely uninspiring, even then Modric would occasionally pop up with an extraordinary 50-yard pass.Goal of the tournament Denis Cheryshev’s strike against Croatia in the quarter-final: a one-two with Artem Dzyuba before unleashing an unstoppable rocket from just outside the area. It was a beautiful goal by itself but a World Cup quarter-final that nobody expected Russia to be in was quite the time to score it.Personal highlight Kieran Trippier’s free-kick against Croatia. I’d been perfecting my media-tribune neutrality up to that point but couldn’t resist celebrating when that went in. And for about an hour it allowed us to believe that maybe it actually, really, genuinely could be coming home.Biggest disappointment It was sad not to see any of the African teams qualify from the group stage. Morocco in particular were devilishly unlucky in a tough group, as were Senegal. Trickiest off-field moment It’s amazing how covering sports tournaments as a journalist seems to end up with the unhealthiest eating regimen imaginable, due to the food available in the media centres. I don’t think I ever want to see a Twix again.Fondest memory of Russia I’ve lived in Russia for years and, while often reporting on gruesome and depressing stories, have tried to write about the more pleasant sides of life in Russia. For readers those pieces often get drowned out by all the terrible stuff going on, so it has been nice to watch so many people get to discover that fun, warm and exciting side of Russia that often gets hidden.What now for England? The future looks positive, though what a shame they didn’t sneak past Croatia and into the final. I can’t imagine they will ever get as favourable a draw and anyway it’s hard to get very excited about anything to do with the next World Cup, given it’s in Qatar.Match of the tournament Belgium 2-1 Brazil. A game that combined quality and drama won in part because of Belgium’s ability (the second goal, Thibaut Courtois’s saves), in part because of Roberto Martínez’s tactical switch to use Kevin De Bruyne as a false 9, and in part because they had the guts and resilience to hang on.Player of the tournament Luka Modric. Nobody expected Croatia to reach the final and they could not have done so without their leader Modric, who passed the ball more than any other member of their squad and ran further than anyone in the tournament bar his own teammate Perisic.Goal of the tournament Nacer Chadli, Belgium v Japan. It wasn’t just the slick interplay, the pace of the break or Romelu Lukaku’s movement it was the sense of occasion, a beautiful goal to finish off a wonderful second half.Personal highlight The final minutes of a tight game when you’re writing a match report to be filed on the whistle are always fraught, and especially when a major shock is brewing. You can’t quite believe Germany are going out, but with 10 minutes or so to go, you tentatively write your intro. Then, on 90 minutes, South Korea have a goal ruled out for what appeared an obvious offside. You type away, wondering why they’re making such a fuss. Then, out of the corner of your eye, you realise Toni Kroos touched the ball to Kim Young-gwon and that he is therefore onside. The entire press box seems to notice at the same time. There is moment of silence as the truth dawns on everybody – he has to give the goal and that means Germany, for the first time in 80 years, are out – then a flurry of keyboards being hammered. One of the great “Christ, this is happening ...” moments Trickiest off-field moment Trying to maintain a sense of perspective and calm while a four-year-old bounces around the compartment screaming for the first eight hours of a 22.5-hour train journey from Kazan to St Petersburg.Fondest memory of Russia Kazan, a beautiful and welcoming city that hosted a string of brilliantly dramatic games.What now for England? Hopefully use the experience as a basis to begin integrating all the youth champions of last year as they begin to play regular league football, while simultaneously recognising the value of a sensible, practical manager and acknowledging Gareth Southgate’s tactical failings. But probably more of the same old nonsense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b30de6ba768b1db5a45791a76a9633f0a1e451/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=366762f95e5c9534bf73bcf95ecb0f3d","title":"world cup 2018 the guardian team of the tournament","story":"Throughout the World Cup, our readers have been able to vote on every single performance and their verdicts have led to this team The World Cup in Russia has come to an end and we can look back at a tournament with only one 0-0 draw among the 64 games. Our readers have been diligently casting their voted at the end of the games and we have used those votes to compile our team of the tournament.Players must have played in at least four games to be selected.The Chelsea goalkeeper performed superbly throughout the tournament. He was never given anything less than a seven and scored a nine in Belgium’s quarter-final win over Brazil, in which he produced one of the saves of the tournament to prevent Neymar equalising towards the end. Iran’s Alireza Beiranvand also scored highly but only played three games while Danijel Subasic, Yann Sommer, Guillermo Ochoa and Jordan Pickford were also given good marks.The Atlético Madrid full-back secures the place to the right of our back four, benefiting from Croatia’s run to the final but also his relentlessness throughout the tournament. He was selected as a full-back but played more like a winger, supporting Ivan Perisic as the team attacked, but never seemed to be neglecting his defensive duties. Thomas Meunier (7.4) and Kieran Trippier (7.33) can both play at full-back and wing-back and came close to forcing their way into this team but did not quite manage it. Consistency personified in Russia, the Besiktas defender was the leader of Zlatko Dalic’s defence, directing not only his centre-back partner Dejan Lovren but also his full-backs, Vrsaljko and Ivan Strinic. He courted controversy with a video on which he was seen shouting “Glory to Ukraine” after Croatia’s win against Russia but on the pitch he was pretty much faultless. In the final he produced one superb sliding challenge to stop Kylian Mbappé and produced the final touch to set up Ivan Perisic’s goal. The Uruguayan just about outscores some high-quality contenders for the second centre-half slot in the team, Raphaël Varane (7.14) coming closest to 32-year-old with Dejan Lovren, Thiago Silva, Harry Maguire, Toby Alderweireld, Andreas Granqvist and Victor Lindelöf all having an average rating of 7.0. Godín collected two eights and two sevens and finally a six as Uruguay crashed out to France in the quarter-finals. The France full-back squeezes into the team with the lowest score of the 11 players, indicating that there was not as much competition for the left-back slot as elsewhere on the pitch. Hernandez, in fairness, had a superb tournament with Didier Deschamps trusting the 22-year-old Atlético Madrid defender to be able to perform on the biggest stage. Hernandez repaid him handsomely, not least in the final with his diligent defending while also setting up Mbappé’s goal. Russia’s Yuri Zhirkov also had an average rating of seven but played only three games. The tireless Internazionale player did not deserve to be on the losing side of the final, having produced another superb example of wing-play at its best. Never stopped running but also, much more importantly, always looked for an end product, whether that was a goal or an assist. Scored a beautiful goal in the final but was also harshly adjudged to have handled in his own box, leading to France’s penalty. Will not be short of suitors if Inter allow him to leave. Always a joy to watch, his ability to pass and shoot with both feet is possibly unparalleled in world football. That he was part of a successful Belgium team helped of course, but he was one of the main reasons they did so well. Was able to perform better once Marouane Fellaini was playing next to him, and scored two sevens, two eights and one nine – the latter against Brazil in the quarter-final. Won the Golden Ball for player of the tournament and our readers gave him the highest average rating of all players (together with Eden Hazard). The Real Madrid playmaker never seems flustered, and hardly ever gives the ball away. He may not have been able to influence the final in the way he would have wanted to but he was wonderful to watch during the four and a half weeks in Russia. Not a starter for the hosts when the tournament began but announced himself to a wider audience after coming on and scoring two goals against Saudi Arabia in the first game. His first was a rocket into the roof of the net and the second a wonderful outside-of-the-foot effort from just inside the box. He scored four in total, with his curled effort to give Russia the lead against Croatia in the quarter-final also a goal-of-the-tournament contender. The Chelsea forward takes the place of the sole attacking midfielder in our 4-4-1-1 formation. The playmaker had an outstanding tournament, scoring three goals and providing two assists on Belgium’s way to third place. He could not quite break down France in the semi-finals but it was not for lack of trying. Always tried to stay on his feet, despite the sometimes fairly brutal attempts to get the ball off him. Russia’s Aleksandr Golovin was one of the other main contenders for this position with an average rating of 7.5.The first teenager to score in a World Cup final since Pelé, capping a brilliant four and a half weeks in Russia with that goal against Croatia at the Luzhniki. We we were all aware that he had the capacity to perform at the World Cup but it was still somewhat surprising to witness the ease with which he took to the biggest stage of them all. Was preferred to players such as Romelu Lukaku (7.33), Mario Mandzukic (7.33) and his own teammate Antoine Griezmann (7.14)Team of the tournament (4-4-1-1)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b58839c155deb84003241dc6a9f97700f0c3125/0_100_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c61e5422817f34b00eee0a0e90a015d","title":"france celebrates world cup victory in pictures","story":"Celebrations carried on into the night after the national team beat Croatia in the World Cup final"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b15578324e75dc289e0f37a5253c29c871f617/0_300_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08a97590ef69b5715319b39fe8b1c2d5","title":"nigeria poverty stricken families struggle survive","story":"Families living on £1.50 a day or less tell of the hardships of life in the oil-rich nation, which now has the greatest concentration of extreme poverty Nkechi John, 39, lives in a single room with her four children and husband, who is a welder. Their daily lives are fairly typical of people in poverty in Nigeria, which according to the Brookings Institution now has the world’s greatest number of extreme poor.“Most of my customers are bricklayers, plumbers, electricians. I couldn’t even sell all of the cake I made today to make up to 400 naira. “I am tired of life,” she says, adding she can believe poverty is now worse than in India. “The suffering’s too much. The president and government need to do something before we all die.“I try to do some farming, but there is no money to buy fertiliser and the crops have all turned yellow due to the lack of it. And only two of our school-age kids are in school because we can’t afford it.” Uche Joseph Uwaleke, an economist at Nasarawa State University in Nigeria’s central region, explains why there has been an increase in extreme poverty. “There is the issue of insecurity in the north-east. Although the Boko Haram violence has been reduced to a manageable level, local farmers in that region are still afraid of going to farms.“Despite the end of the recession, manufacturing, the transportation sector and agriculture have still not recovered.”He also blames poor governance. “The late approval and poor implementation of the budget is another reason for the growing poverty. All of this affects jobs.”Although Uwaleke sees glimmers of hope from policies to improve Nigeria’s chronic poverty he is concerned that the situation remains fragile.Life is also a struggle for Mohammed Ahmed, 33. The Islamic teacher and father-of-four comes from Borno state and now lives in Abuja. He and his extended family have just £1.50 a day to live on, including what he manages to send to relatives in Maiduguri to help them buy food.“Because of Boko Haram they cannot go to the farms because they are afraid they will be killed. Nobody is farming in Borno state except within Maiduguri, the state capital. But I can’t give them anything because I struggle to take care of my family.”Like Nkechi John, he also struggles to buy fertiliser he needs to grow the crops on his small farm. “The government says one 50kg bag should cost 5,500 naira but that is not even available. So we have to buy in the open market where the bag costs 15,000 naira. So I can’t afford to buy enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37834989c381b305bb4aa08b129fd90497b31e8b/0_181_2710_1626/master/2710.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bd720702e014cb4948412e91d8618d8","title":"netflix subscribers numbers forecasts wall street","story":"Second-quarter results show company missed forecasts by 1m subscribers, which analysts describe as a ‘near-term gut punch’Netflix, the streaming giant behind hits like The Crown and Stranger Things, missed its own forecasts by more than a million subscribers, sending its shares down sharply.For the second quarter, Netflix reported a profit of $384.3m, or 85 cents a share, up from $65.6m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier.The company blamed the surprise subscriber target miss on faulty internal forecasting.This is not the first time Netflix has experienced problems predicting new subscription numbers. The company has misjudged its forecast three times in the past 10 quarters.In total, Netflix said it had added 670,000 streaming customers in the US, barely more than half its anticipated 1.2 million subscribers. It also missed its anticipated overseas subscriber estimates by over 500,000.Analyst Daniel Ives at GB Insights said the results were a “near-term gut punch” to the Netflix bull thesis. After years of blowing Wall Street expectations, Ives added: ‘This is a clear speed bump for Netflix as the international miss was most concerning given this is the linchpin to the core growth thesis for the coming years.”In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said subscriber growth in the US through the first six months of this year is still ahead of the comparable period last year. But it also warned that subscriber growth in the current third quarter would likely be around 5 million, again below analysts’ expectations of 6.3 million.With subscription-streaming services now becoming the dominant business model for video content, Netflix is beginning to face competition for content from rivals like Amazon and Apple.Netflix is expected to invest as much as $12bn on content this year, but could face growing competition in the streaming market. Apple is upping its spending on original content in video, music and publishing to $4.2bn by 2022 from $1bn this year. Amazon is expected to almost double its spending on original content from $4.5bn to $8.3bn.The boom in video streaming is causing established Hollywood movie studios to rapidly re-order their business models. AT\u0026ampT is set to acquire Time Warner and both Disney and Comcast are in a bidding war for 21st Century Fox.While Netflix says its anticipates greater competition, it has also been investing heavily in foreign markets, including India. The company also struck a unique deal with Barack and Michelle Obama to produce shows and documentaries.But Netflix has not been immune to turbulence, and moved to fire chief communications officer Jonathan Friedland after he used a racial slur in his conversations at work. Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings later blamed his own privilege for leading him to minimize race issues and said Netflix had work to do to improve.In his shareholders letter, Hastings touted Netflix’s recent Emmys achievement, beating out HBO with 112 nominations. He also praised films like Set It Up and The Kissing Booth, which he said had been viewed by “tens of millions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

Large meanders in the jet stream often lead to the development of huge anticyclones – areas of high pressure that can remain stationary for weeks at a time.A blocking area of high pressure, sitting over Scandinavia and western Russia in February and early March, maintained a static weather pattern and pulled in a conveyor of sub-zero air to the UK. Just four months later, blocking allowed high pressure to settle close to the UK. This has resulted in very warm and extremely dry conditions with some central and southern parts of the UK seeing no measurable rain for over a month. Predicting when and where atmospheric blocking will take place is difficult, although there are some clues. One signal is solar activity, the levels of radiation, sunspots and other solar phenomena that ebb and flow on a periodic 11-year cycle. Studies have shown that, on average, a decrease in solar activity can promote an increase in atmospheric blocking, although the relationship is complex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b4305a03a7aaa50d9700467f7f5b25a7b626657/182_256_3318_1992/master/3318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d37afa4870b0475bdaaadfffc62eaa51","title":"68 rabbis labour chooses ignore uk jewish community","story":"Letter to  criticises party for ‘rewriting’ accepted definition of antisemitismMore than 60 British rabbis have written a joint letter saying Labour has “chosen to ignore the Jewish community,” as the party’s ruling body prepares for a meeting on its antisemitism code of conduct.Some of the UK’s most senior rabbis, in a letter to the , said Labour was acting in an “insulting and arrogant way” by choosing – in its new code – to amend an international definition of antisemitism.Signatories include Rabbi Harvey Belovski, vice-chair of the United Synagogue’s rabbinical council, and Rabbis Laura Janner-Klausner, Danny Rich and Jonathan Wittenberg, leaders of the Reform, Liberal and Masorti movements.“Antisemitism within sections of the Labour party has become so severe and widespread that we must speak out with one Jewish voice,” the letter said.“The Labour party’s leadership has chosen to ignore those who understand antisemitism the best, the Jewish community. By claiming to know what’s good for our community, the Labour party’s leadership have chosen to act in the most insulting and arrogant way.”The letter said it was “not the Labour party’s place to rewrite a definition of antisemitism” saying that the full definition set out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) had been accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service, the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and 124 local authorities.Signatories also include Rabbi Avraham Pinter, a leading Hasidic rabbi, from Stamford Hill, north London. It is unprecedented for ultra orthodox rabbis to co-sign a letter with female, progressive rabbis. The letter was co-ordinated by the Jewish Labour Movement, which said the 68 rabbis represented more than 30,000 UK Jewish households.As part of its new code of conduct, Labour has agreed to adopt the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, but does not include all the examples set out by the body. The party’s full NEC is to meet on Tuesday to agree its new code of conduct. Labour has argued that those examples that have been removed were already covered in the wider new code of conduct. The examples which have been removed from the IHRA definition include accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own nations, claiming that the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavour and comparing Israeli actions to those of the Nazis.Labour strongly denied that it was attempting to redefine antisemitism. “This Code of Conduct is not a new definition of antisemitism and does not seek to re-define antisemitism,” a Labour party spokeswoman said. “The Code adopts the IHRA definition and contextualises and adds to the working examples to produce practical guidelines that a political party can apply in disciplinary cases. They are the most detailed and comprehensive guidelines on antisemitism adopted by any political party in this country.”“There will continue to be discussion and dialogue with Jewish communal organisations, rabbis and synagogues about the Code of Conduct and fighting antisemitism.”Labour MPs voted overwhelmingly on Monday night at a private meeting of backbenchers to unilaterally accept the definition.The motion, proposed by two Jewish MPs, Luciana Berger and Alex Sobel, calls on the parliamentary Labour party to adopt the definition and say that MPs believe that the national executive committee (NEC) should follow suit.“The motion passed at tonight’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party sends a strong signal that we adopt the IHRA definition in full, including all the specific examples it includes, and that any attempt to tinker, water down, or otherwise amend it must be resisted,” Berger said. Before the meeting, the Labour MP Richard Burden, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Palestine, had written to colleagues urging them to accept the Labour code of conduct.Burden said antisemitism was pernicious racism but there were problems with the wording of some examples in the IHRA definition which he said had a “chequered history and are a great deal more contentious than the movers of Monday’s motion allow”.He added: “A number of them can be and are used to suppress debate over Israel and Palestine. The Labour MP Chuka Umunna has also written a strongly worded letter to colleagues, the  understands. Umunna said he took exceptions to claims by the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, that the exclusion of the IHRA examples took into account criticism that had been made of the wording by the home affairs select committee.Umunna, who was a member of that committee, said the committee’s “overall handling of the issue of antisemitism, including not only our report but the engagement with the Jewish community”, was “widely praised.” He added: “Whereas the committee properly consulted Jewish community groups, the party has not.”Umunna said he believed that the Jewish community had “clearly been subject to differential treatment by our party these last few years which is discriminatory”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e54e91e5b89010b6aba8b81ea7b2bd72f878fd9/0_251_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69afb40cd847011571c492dad6a74e11","title":"sending mps on early holiday could make all the difference for may","story":"While Tories remain so febrile over Brexit, there is little point keeping them at WestminsterFew people have the power to bring forward their summer holiday. But for Theresa May, bringing forward the summer recess could make all the difference. So when rumours circulated that the government would propose that the break begin as early as this Thursday they were immediately believed. Far more importantly, No 10 did not deny them.The prime minister’s grip on the premiership has been precarious since she announced the Chequers compromise a week and a half ago but, however unhappy hardline Tories have been with her softer Brexit proposals, they have not yet been able to muster the 48 MPs who are willing to send in letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 committee to hold a vote of no confidence in her.While the mood in her party remains so febrile, there is little point keeping MPs at a hot and sticky Westminster. Better for them to go on holiday until September and reflect on the opinion polls, some of which have shown Labour taking the lead as Conservative isions have come to the fore.May has already displayed a remarkable capacity for resilience in the toughest period of her premiership since the general election. Donald Trump may have insulted her Brexit strategy in an interview with the Sun, but he has since apologised and upheld the “most special of relationships”. And, crucially, the visit of the world’s most unpredictable leader to the UK is over.Remainers have withdrawn their attempt to force the UK to stay in the EU’s customs union and are now mobilised in anger against the prime minister’s most dangerous threat, the European Research Group. David Davis has resigned in protest at her Brexit strategy but is making clear that he does not want May to fall, however much he may disagree with her proposed negotiating approach.There are still threats though. The most obvious is Boris Johnson. The former foreign secretary has been a surprisingly slight figure since his resignation. His first Daily  column, a discussion of “global Britain”, was a lightweight disappointment. But there is still an expectation that he will seek to make a resignation statement to the Commons, and a belief that he could yet inflame a rebellion against the prime minister should he so wish. Another reason to bring forward the end of term.Getting to the holidays also gives May the chance to make progress in negotiations with the European Union, which begin in earnest when new Brexit secretary Dominic Raab visits Brussels on Thursday. It offers the prime minister time to reset the debate. The finishing line is in sight, although May has not yet quite crossed it.

Among the remains, the team unearthed small, round tubers of a wetland plant known as club-rush, traces of legumes and plants belonging to the cabbage family, wild cereals including some ground wheat and barley – and 642 small charred lumps. Analysis of 24 of these lumps revealed they are bread-like – with the others expected to be similar.“They are charred breadcrumbs, sort of what you might find at the bottom of your toaster at home – the sort of stuff that falls off when you put it on high power,” said Richter.Further analyses revealed that 15 of the 24 crumbs contain tissues from cereal plants – probably, says Richter, from barley, einkorn wheat or oats.Some of the crumbs were also found to contain ingredients from other plants, with the team saying club-rush tuber is the most likely candidate.What’s more, the analysis of the crumbs suggests the flour used to make the bread might have been sieved, while the team say the lack of an oven means the bread was probably baked in the ashes of the fire, or on a hot stone.The team say the crumbs appear most likely to be from a sort of unleavened flat bread.While the newly discovered crumbs are now the earliest bread remains found so far, taking the title from remains found at the site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey and dated to about 9,100 years ago, the team say the food might have emerged even earlier. Richter said it is unlikely the bread found at the Natufian site was consumed as a staple, given it would have been very labour intensive to gather and process the grains. While the team suggest the bread could have been made by the hunter-gatherers for their onward journey, they say other evidence adds weight to the idea it could have been part of a feast or ritual event.Amy Bogaard, professor of Neolithic and bronze age archaeology at the University of Oxford and who was not involved in the research, described the study as fascinating. “We previously knew that these communities were grinding and preparing plants in various ways, but this study is the first to identify actual bread-like remains of this early date,” she said. “ In terms of food history, it suggests that preparation of flatbread-like foods long predates the establishment of agriculture, and that farming in this region emerged within a pre-established culture of grinding and baking.” While the team have yet to recreate the recipe, Richter says they have tried bread made with club-rush tubers, offering a clue as to how the ancient bread might have tasted.“It tastes a little bit salty, so it is probably not to our particular tastes in the present,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84167900c8a499f6f00e8a390492b517b8baf76d/75_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6202aa1d1587ac1ef13c8296083de7b4","title":"rocket men locals divided over plans for uks first spaceport","story":"Remote Scottish peninsula chosen for satellite launchpad with promise of jobsA remote area of land on the northern coast of Scotland is on track to become the UK’s first rocket spaceport after it was selected as the best place in the country from which to blast satellites into orbit.The isolated county of Sutherland is one of the few spots in Britain where golden eagles and sea eagles still take to the skies, but from the early 2020s the birds may be sharing airspace with rockets bearing small satellites for communications and Earth observation.The area’s economic development agency, Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), intends to build the launch site on Sutherland’s A’Mhoine peninsula, between Tongue and Durness, with an initial £2.5m grant from the UK Space Agency. As yet, there are no roads that lead to the chosen site.Ministers hope that pressing ahead with commercial spaceports in Britain will help to bolster technical jobs and secure income from the rapidly growing market for satellite launches. The spaceport at Sutherland would launch micro-satellites into highly desirable polar and sun-synchronous orbits, the latter of which pass over the same spot at the same time each day. On Monday, the UK Space Agency announced it had awarded £23m to the US aerospace group Lockheed Martin, which is expected to fly its Electron rocket from Sutherland. The agency handed a further £5 to Orbex, a British space company which is developing a rocket called Prime.Cllr Linda Munro, who chairs the Sutherland county committee, said the nearest population to the proposed launch site was a crofting township of about 200 people at Talmine on the Kyle of Tongue. She said residents were ided about the scheme’s impacts and benefits.“Some are very very pro, some people have real concerns,” she said. “On both sides, the feelings are very strong.”Some were understandably worried about the noise, with many prizing their solitude, and fearing disruption to a settled way of life as well as the environmental and safety risks that come with rockets being launched into orbit.After the announcement, the HIE said it had raised a total of £17.3m to develop the spaceport. HIE said it would put in nearly £10m, with the remainder coming from other sources. It said a final planning application was expected to be submitted in late 2019, with the scheme creating 40 jobs directly but supporting up to 400 jobs in the wider economy.Munro said she supported the spaceport project, but cautioned that much hinged on how carefully HIE and Highlands council carried out their consultations with residents and how Lockheed Martin and others included locals in the job opportunities.“I’m looking for real investment in jobs. I’m definitely looking for upskilling for people already living here. My greatest joy is what this will mean for our young people and children already growing up here, with an expectation of better jobs and better days.”The Sutherland site was chosen over two other contenders in the HIE area, Unst in Shetland and North Uist in the Western Isles. Charlotte Wright, HIE’s chief executive, said the needs of the local population were uppermost in its planning.“We are also determined that this project will deliver strong community benefits, and our input at this early stage enables us to engage with local people to ensure the presence of the spaceport is a really positive development for this part of Sutherland,” she said.Meanwhile, a “horizontal” spaceport is to be created at Cornwall airport near Newquay with the first satellites launched from the airport in the north of the county within three years. Unlike the vertical spaceport which will be built in Sutherland, horizontalones have long runways instead of launchpads to accommodate space planes, which take off like conventional aircraft.Virgin Orbit, part of the Virgin Group, is aiming to launch satellites into space by using a modified 747-400. The Boeing will carry a rocket under its wing to a launch range over the Atlantic and release it at around 11,000m (35,000ft) for onward flight into space, carrying a satellite into Earth’s orbit.Champions of the scheme said it would be able to conduct low-cost missions quickly and efficiently by bypassing established launch ranges. The Cornwall site will be the UK’s first horizontal spaceport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec13c02e5a17fa3fb13472cec62328721db24f67/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f8dfc64cba355e49f41867156f59beb","title":"cycling lizzie deignan trek womens professional team","story":"Lizzie Deignan will lead a new professional women’s team in 2019 backed by the current men’s World Tour sponsor, Trek. The former world champion, who will have her first child in September, is targeting the UCI world road championships in Yorkshire next year and is already looking ahead to the next Olympic Games in 2020.“I always thought that becoming a mum would shorten my career,” the 29-year-old said, “but in fact it has prolonged my career – so I will be targeting the 2020 Olympics.“The Yorkshire world championships for me is the biggest goal that I could ever imagine in my career. It literally goes past the house I grew up in and finishes about a kilometre from the house I’m going to live in. It’s about as ‘home’ as you can get, so for me there’s no bigger motivation.”Describing the launch of the women’s team as “historic”, Trek’s CEO, John Burke, said that the team was “really optimistic about women’s cycling”. He said: “We really believe the team will inspire a group of riders over the years to come.”Deignan is the first of a dozen names to be added to the Trek women’s team roster, which will hit the road at the start of next season. The former British national champion, who was subject to offers from other teams, plans to resume training in December.The new team, which will employ only full-time professional riders, will increase pressure on race organisers, including ASO, promoters of the Tour de France, to further develop their own programme of women’s racing, including a women’s Tour, something which the UCI president, David Lappartient, has promised will happen within his four-year tenure.“I lobbied for a women’s Tour de France in the past and will be lobbying for it in the future,” Burke said. “The Tour is the perfect vehicle to take women’s racing to a new level. Would you rather watch one incredible bike race or two? I really think by putting one plus one together you can make three.”“I’d love to be a stage in my career when it’s more about me as an athlete, rather than my politics,” Deignan said. “It’s difficult but I accept that’s part of the responsibility of growing the sport. I think society in general is changing. I’m proud to be a small part of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbc7a6fc2f1611a66b5aae56605740e68ad6474/849_0_4363_2618/master/4363.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=442ba8e2de3bdba2a0619f9629be15f5","title":"mark cavendish tour de france stage wins record eddy merckx","story":"As he made it to the finish line in Roubaix on Sunday, the 52nd rider to come home on a day of bone-rattling cobbles and throat-clogging dust, Mark Cavendish would have been looking forward to a rest day. The first week of the 2018 Tour de France was harsh on a man who, chasing the all-time record of stage wins, had started the season with a series of bad crashes. The signs have not been promising for one of the most remarkable British sporting figures of our lifetime.The four victories that would bring him level with Eddy Merckx’s 34 are now out of reach for this year, at least. After a 500-mile transfer to the first rest day in Annecy, three days in the high mountains come before his next chance of a win, at the end of Friday’s flat stage from Bourg d’Oisans to Valence. Two more opportunities then present themselves, in Pau on stage 18 and in Paris on the final day.Paris would be a good one to win, of course. It would bring back memories of his four consecutive triumphs on the Champs Élysées, none more resplendent than 2012, when he wore the world champion’s rainbow jersey and was led into the final kilometre by his yellow-clad teammate Bradley Wiggins. For British cycling, that seemed like the day of days.So the record will have to wait until next year at least, and there are plenty of people ready to venture the opinion that the Manxman has missed his opportunity. Cavendish himself appeared to give them support when he was asked before this year’s Grand Départ whether he still commanded the same power that was at his disposal in the years when we was winning four, five and even six stages in a single Tour. His reply was typically blunt. “No,” he said. “I’m 33 years old and I’ve got four kids at home.”Others believe that his age has yet to assume a real relevance.Clearly his power and endurance are sufficient to carry him to the end of a stage in the leading group. His instinct for the right place to be in the hectic scuffle of the closing showdown is unlikely to have deserted him.What might be more relevant is the second part of his statement. The “four kids at home” are, as this emotional man has often said, the light of his life. They include a baby son, born in May, whom he has hardly seen, thanks to his pre-Tour training regime. The writer Cyril Connolly once warned that the pram in the hallway was the enemy of promise, while Enzo Ferrari believed that marriage slowed his drivers down by iding their concentration. While neither view might stand up to serious examination, there could be occasions when it rings true.Cavendish’s devotion to his sport at all levels is beyond question. But sprinting is a matter of fine margins, both physical and mental, and a father of four would probably not be quite as keen to expose himself to the kind of risk that led to his collision with Peter Sagan a year ago, for which the Slovak was disqualified from the Tour. The crash ended Cavendish’s race with a shoulder injury which, he told my colleague William Fotheringham recently, has permanently affected the way he rides.“Gone are the days when I got angry,” he also said during the same interview, but there have been one or two signs of the sparks that once lit the bonfire of his competitive ferocity. At the end of Friday’s stage in Chartres his temper flared briefly when he accused journalists of concentrating on his own “choppy” riding rather than that of others. But he also conceded that, although his power meter had been giving encouraging messages, he was not able to match the speed of those ahead of him, led by Dylan Groenewegen, a 25-year-old Dutchman.A day later he might have had a rueful chuckle when he found himself elevated from 10th to eighth place in Amiens following the relegation of two of his direct rivals. André Greipel and Fernando Gaviria had displeased the commissaires when they came together in the final 300 metres while trying in vain to prevent Groenewegen from taking his second stage in a row. Once upon a time it would have been Cavendish in the thick of such an elbows-out, helmet-banging alpha-sprinter tussle.He may have seen the writing on the wall during his last season with Quick-Step in 2015, when Gaviria, then aged 20, arrived from Colombia and showed himself to be the obvious candidate to become the team’s next star sprinter. Two wins over Cavendish in the early-season Tour de San Luis prompted the former world champion to strike back and beat the young pretender in the final stage, but the long-term message was not hard to decipher.No longer does he have the best team around him, as was usually the case in his days with Highroad, Team Sky and Quick-Step. At Dimension Data he can count on the presence of Mark Renshaw, his long-time pilot fish, but Bernie Eisel, the brains and engine of his most effective lead-out trains, is still recovering from brain surgery following an accident during a race in March.And, of course, they are all getting older, even the man whose precocious virtuosity once led a writer for L’Equipe to call him the Mozart of the 11-tooth sprocket. Perhaps more victories lie ahead.If not then we have been fortunate to watch him, and to call him ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9307ec9ddaed58f5a0fbef8c364bee219976984b/0_0_4542_2727/master/4542.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d80113c9e67b888203ce5bf9b17d3339","title":"alkaline review park theatre","story":"Park theatre, LondonStephanie Martin’s drama – part comedy of manners and part state-of-the-nation play – is one killer scene short of greatnessAlkaline takes the well-worn drama of the middle-class dinner party and gives it an unexpected twist. The play opens as Sophie and her fiance, Nick, prepare to host an old school friend, Sarah, and her new British Asian boyfriend, Ali. The moral panic brewing in Sophie’s sitting room is not just over Ali’s cultural difference, but also Sarah’s recent conversion to Islam. It is an edgy, and potentially explosive, starting point for what is both a contemporary comedy of manners and a state-of-the-nation play about Brexit, liberalism, austerity, and most of all, the threat that modern Islam is perceived to pose to the conservative heartlands of middle England.Sarah arrives wearing a hijab and talks of finding herself through her new faith: “It’s like trying to describe what love feels like in your stomach,” she tells Sophie, and these moments, in which she relates what Islam has come to mean to her, are some of the most poetic and powerful.Georgia de Grey’s slickly designed set is claustrophobically intimate, and Stephanie Martin’s script is strong on excruciatingly stilted small talk and politically incorrect faux pas. The tone and setup is reminiscent of Abigail’s Party in the early scenes. Sophie is the little Englander who can’t accept Ali and Sarah’s relationship and she is keenly satirised for it, from her casual racism towards Ali to awkward exchanges with Sarah. “It’s suits you,” she says of the headscarf, before commanding her not to wear it at her wedding, where Sarah will be a bridesmaid.Ali responds nonchalantly, sipping beer, ribbing Sophie (“I vote Islamic takeover”) and appearing pre-eminently English, however hard Sophie tries to position him as an outsider. Each of the couples play their parts convincingly – though EJ Martin’s Sophie and Claire Cartwright’s Sarah are far more fleshed out as characters than their male counterparts. The brittle humour exposes faultlines in both relationships, but the play builds to an explosive climax – like the heart attack of Abigail’s Party – that never comes. When Ali’s wife, Aleesha, suddenly enters, it appears as if teeth might be bared, but the couples maintain a veneer of middle-class civility to the end. Alkaline winds up feeling like a play whose final, killer scene has not yet been written. With it, this drama could be devastatingly good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c66f62526c41c2171c47e4e5f6c091cec698298/46_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de605628d0527e982b24a7cf617a894c","title":"who is america review sacha baron cohen frightening funny","story":"Sacha Baron Cohen’s new characters are brilliantly done, but it is not always clear who or what the target isThese are – gosh – testing times for anyone who is still trying to keep alive the distinction between truth and lies, reality and fiction, the president of the United States and an ambulant cheese stick, sanity and madness.

Back then, what you saw in the world was largely what you got. But tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis, which is Latin for: “We’re all fucked now, so things have to change.”Worse still is the segment with “Cain-N’Degeocello”, who sits down to dinner with Trump supporter Jane Page Thompson and her husband in their South Carolina home and asks not one question about their continued support of the man likely to be impeached before the cheese course. Instead, he paints himself as an increasingly extreme liberal, who encourages his daughter (“Malala”) to free-bleed on the US flag and whose partner is having an open affair with a porpoise. The Thompsons’ smiles become fixed, but he is a guest in their home and they treat him as such. Thus all Baron Cohen succeeds in doing is humanising two Trump diehards. Is this anyone’s preferred outcome?Partial redemption, at least, comes in the final segment (after a dismal interaction with the faecal artist and a gallery owner in Laguna Beach, which requires her to sit through the sound of off-stage huffings as he produced one of his “works”). Morad (“Are liberals using school shootings to further their anti-tragedy agenda?”) gets various gun nuts in and outside Washington to promote arming pre-schoolers. “Fill the Puppy Pistol by pushing his lunchbox into his belly and sending the naughty me for a really, really long timeout,” says one, joyously. The gun lobbyist Larry Pratt notes that if children are young enough, “if they haven’t developed a conscience yet, they can make very good soldiers”.The final, most insoluble problem presents itself: it would be funny only if it weren’t so frightening. Most of what they say is already on record and has been publicly cheered to the rafters by people whose views aren’t going to change by the addition of some minor logical absurdism. If it is being played for laughs, it is a venture that needs to stick to embarrassing people with rude pictures. If it is aiming for satire, it needs a clear, worthy target and an unerring aim. Maybe the much-hyped coming confrontations with Sarah Palin and Roy Moore will refine the scattergun approach. Fill the Puppy Pistol, and take your shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/956465c7f0e3302a84ea3c125480216d18fbb7f4/0_101_3037_1822/master/3037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f7ecfb298b0ed4cd5fe0ef1b6e86ca","title":"jared kushner firm investigated over tenant harassment claims new york","story":"Tenants claim they were harassed in an effort to push them out so they could be replaced with higher-paying tenantsNew York governor Andrew Cuomo’s office on Monday unveiled an investigation into claims the family-run firm of Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner tried to harass tenants out of an apartment building in a fashionable section of Brooklyn. The decision follows an Associated Press report published on Sunday in which more than a dozen current and former tenants of Austin Nichols House in Williamsburg claimed they were subjected to relentless construction noise, toxic dust and an infestation of rodents, combined with steep rent hikes, as part of an effort to force them out so they could be replaced with higher-paying tenants.“Governor Cuomo has zero tolerance for tenant abuse of any kind and we will aggressively take on landlords who try to intimidate people out of their homes,” said RuthAnne Visnauskas, commissioner of New York State Homes and Community Renewal, in a statement.“In New York, no one is above the law, and we will thoroughly investigate the appalling allegations of harassment at this or any related property.” Over the past three years, the AP report claimed, more than 250 rent-stabilized apartments, or three-quarters of tenants of the building – were either emptied or sold, bringing in around $155m to Kushner Companies. “They won, they succeeded,” said Barth Bazyluk, who left apartment C606 with his family last year. “You have to be ignorant or dumb to think this wasn’t deliberate.”Aaron Carr, head of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenant’s rights watchdog that filed a $10m lawsuit late on Sunday claiming that some tenants were also exposed to high levels of cancer-causing dust, said the conditions and tenant exodus “provides a window into the Kushner Companies′ predatory business model”.Kushner and two partners paid $275m for the building in April 2015. The company has denied harassing tenants to get them out, and said it will defend itself vigorously.“The residents of Austin Nichols House were fully informed about the planned renovation and all work was completed under the full supervision by the New York City Department of Buildings and other regulatory agencies, with full permits and with no violations for these claims,” the company said in a statement.The latest lawsuit adds to Kushner Companies’ extensive list of financial and legal woes. The company is faced with finding $1.2bn to refinance its flagship New York property at 666 Fifth Avenue. It has also been forced to defend itself against reports that it has taken out loans totaling $509m from lenders with whom Kushner has held White House meetings. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly looking into the company’s promotion of White House ties to pitch EB-5, a congressionally approved visa-for-investment system, to Chinese investors. Nor are tenants in the Williamsburg development the first to claim that Kushner Companies has attempted to push them out by creating unlivable conditions.In March, a New York City council member, Ritchie Torres, and a tenant’s rights group, Housing Rights Initiative (HRI), said they would launch an investigation of Kushner Companies following accusations it routinely filed false paperwork with New York City, declaring it had no rent-regulated tenants in buildings it owned. HRI claimed that the company had entered at least 80 false applications for building permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016 claiming they had no rent-regulated tenants. But tax documents showed there were more than 300 such units. The strategy, tenants claimed, allowed the company to start renovations designed to drive them out.

Here’s what happenedIt was a regular Sunday when they arrested me. I’d just gotten paid – back then I was working in the fields, picking grapes – and the kids decided they wanted to go to Ihop for breakfast.We got in the car and my oldest daughter, Jennifer, was driving and joking around, and we were all laughing. She was just being so silly. We got to the restaurant, the little ones ordered pancakes, and Jennifer and I had omelettes. We finished and got back in the car.That’s when they came. I don’t know where they had been hiding, but suddenly there were seven Ice officers, all in uniform. I don’t know how they found me, but they thought I was driving the car. One of them started knocking on the driver’s side window and asking Jennifer: Are you Floricel Liborio Ramos?One officer, he spoke Spanish. He said: You have to get out of the car and answer some questions. Then he said: Sorry, but we’ll be taking you in, and the kids will be staying here. Is there anyone who can come and get them?I had to phone my friend who was miles away. She asked me if I was allowed to wait for her to arrive – after all, the youngest kids were only 10 and 12. The officer said no, they had to take me right now. Ihop is always busy on a Sunday. There was a line of people waiting to eat and they were all standing there watching as the commotion happened. One officer told me I was going to go through deportation, that I couldn’t see a judge. I cried out: I have a life here! I have three kids who live here! They’re citizens!They put me in handcuffs in front of my kids and put me in the back of a car. I looked at my children’s faces. All I felt was sadness.I kept eye contact with them until the car started moving. Then I sat in the back, alone. The ride was silent.I came to the United States from Mexico in 1998, when I was 18. I come from a humble background, five brothers and sisters, from an indigenous family. I always wanted to help my parents out, but nobody would give me work in Mexico, so I decided to cross the border. I went first to Los Angeles, then I went to San Jose.Once I was there, I got my chance – two jobs, working six days a week at each of them. I worked at McDonald’s, starting a shift at 5am and getting out at 2pm, then I went to work in a taqueria from 5pm until 11 or 12 at night. It was really tiring and stressful. The work had to be done really quickly, and one of my jobs was washing the dishes, so I would get home and my clothes would be dirty and damp, but I would just fall asleep sitting down on the sofa. But when I got my paycheck I’d feel so pleased, because at least I knew my parents would have something to eat.That was when I met my children’s dad. He worked at the taqueria and was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico too. I would get out really late, and when I’d leave at midnight he would give me a ride home. We started hanging out, and then it turned into a relationship. He was deported in 2012 – one day he left for work and didn’t come back. The kids still talk to him, but he’s not really part of our lives any more.One Monday in the detention facility, an officer walked around and called out names. There were nine of us. We were told we’d have to get up at 3am because we were going to be taken away. This feeling of fear came over me – normally they would only take people out at that time of night when they were going to be deported. They said: No, you’re actually going to be transferred. The facility had gotten too full.They drove us to Gilroy and put us in a small van to transfer us to the next place. By this time it was hot outside, over 100 degrees, and there were too many people to fit inside. We were squeezed in, shackled at the wrists, the waist, the ankles. There was no air conditioning, and it was even hotter inside the van than it was outside. It was like getting in a furnace everything was so dark. I felt like I was choking.That’s when the chaos started. One woman was older, she had diabetes, she started feeling dizzy and throwing up. Another lady was claustrophobic, and she started screaming and tearing off her clothes. We hadn’t had anything to eat, and they didn’t give us any water – all we needed was just a single drop of water – and we were all still chained up, handcuffed, our clothes drenched in sweat, banging on the grill shouting, saying, We can’t breathe! Then one woman just passed out. We couldn’t tell if she was alive or dead. We started telling the driver, Please! Stop! Somebody’s unconscious! I couldn’t breathe any more. I thought I was never going to see my kids again. But he didn’t stop the van, he just told us to shut up. He just sat there, driving and texting on his phone. I think we’re only alive by a miracle.Sometimes I thought it was going to be my last night in the cell. I’d be mentally prepared, I’d go to see the judge, optimistic that something would happen. Then it wouldn’t, and I’d leave feeling even worse, because we had nothing concrete. But the worst thing was that I couldn’t be there when my kids needed me. All of their birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas. Those were the days I would just cry and cry. I worked cleaning the toilets for a dollar a day – nobody else would do it, but that dollar was money I could use to make a phone call to speak to my children. One minute costs 10 cents. When I called them I was desperate to have a long conversation, but I couldn’t afford it. They’d say: When are you coming home? We’ve been alone for a long time now, what’s happening? I’d try and dodge the questions, tell them to be good and to stay out of trouble. Daisy, my youngest daughter, would just cry. My heart was broken. Then the phone would just go dead, and I’d have to borrow minutes from someone else because I couldn’t let the conversation end like that. When you are detained, you don’t see the daylight. You’re stuck in the process. When they would take us to a court appearance, they would chain us up: at the hands, the waist, the ankles. In reality, we were only being taken to a different room in the detention center – we would only ever talk to the judge by video link. But we’d be shackled the whole time.They never gave me an interpreter at court hearings, so I would try and understand what the judge was saying by looking at her face. I used to see how she would talk to other people she would act much more patient with some of them than others. For me, her body, her behavior … they were very harsh. I would see the reactions on her face, it heightened my fears.To them, I was a single mother who had started using alcohol. I’d never drunk a drop before, but I was having problems sleeping because of anxiety – and after a long shift one of my co-workers offered me a beer. I started drinking to help me sleep, and that’s when I got a DUI. I know I made mistakes, but I’d taken parenting classes. I’d done a rehab program. I wasn’t drinking any more. But in court they would say I had no right to be free because I was a danger to society. They’d say: Imagine what could happen if she was released and then went and killed someone. It really darkened my feelings. I used to think: Am I a risk to society?I never really slept for a whole night while I was there. When it was hot at night, the officers would turn off the air conditioning. The mattresses were made out of plastic, and they would get so hot. So we used to clean the floor with our sanitary towels and then sleep on the floor because it was made of concrete, and so it was colder. I felt like I was choking.There were a lot of nightmares that something would happen to my kids. I’d wake up at three in the morning, the anxiety running through my head. I would close my eyes and think I was about to fall asleep and then the nightmares would start again. Sometimes I’d dream that I’d been released and then open my eyes and all I’d see is the wall and I’d realize that I was still in detention.They would let you have a paper and pen in your cell, so I kept a journal. It helped to write my experiences and feelings down. But the trauma is never going to go away. One day, when I feel ready, I want to sit down with a coffee and go through it and read it over. I’m not ready yet.One day, after 11 months in detention, they put on the shackles, put me in a van, and drove me to the detention facility in San Francisco. I was taken into a room and they started giving me documents to sign. You’re about to be released, they said. Who are you calling? Does your lawyer know?I was afraid. I thought: If I answer these questions wrong, maybe they’ll send me back. I couldn’t believe them. But then they took off the shackles, led me out through this huge door, pushed me out, closed it, and just left me there in the street.I saw this Mexican man walking by slowly, he looked so happy, I could see him just enjoying his liberty. I was thinking: Does anyone know about me? It was only when I saw my lawyer coming down the street, when I was able to hug her without anyone yelling NO TOUCHING!, when I could walk about without shackles, that I was finally able to believe.Right now my goal is to be with the kids, support them, help them stay in school. It was a long time I was gone, and for now I am free – but they were put in a difficult place. My youngest daughter always cries, she wants me to sleep in the bed with her every night because she’s worried she’ll wake up one day and I won’t be there. I’m relieved, but I still feel like a prisoner – without documentation, I’m not allowed to work, I’m not allowed to drive, and I don’t have anyone to really talk to. If I get scared, or if I have a strange feeling, I just text my lawyer.The process is difficult, but the hardest thing is the uncertainty. Not knowing. When you’re in detention, they own you. You’re impotent. They take a hold of you. And that’s where the uncertainty comes in. You don’t know if it will be weeks, months, or years until they make a decision. It becomes difficult to tell reality from fiction. It changes your state of mind. It’s like you are dead, but actually you are alive. It’s like when they put meat in the freezer. You’re stuck in time.Floricel Liborio Ramos is one of 50,000–70,000 undocumented immigrants who have been denied bond hearings by the US government. She was given supervised release by the US district court in March 2018 after 11 months of detention, and at the time of press was still waiting for decision on her deportation case.As told to Bobbie Johnson.

Later, soaked by the rain, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović smiled in defeat and hugged every player from both teams as the winners were given their medals.Boris Dežulović, a journalist and political commentator, said: “Her presence at the World Cup could definitely be described as an extended pre-election video.“She has used this to reinforce her PR strategy of being the people’s president. This is something she has been doing in Croatia for a while now.“Instead of being limited to the Croatian public, this campaign video of sorts was seen by billions of people all over the world.”Grabar-Kitarović was elected president in 2015, presented as the new “polished” face of the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).The party faced a slew of corruption charges over the years, the most noteworthy being those involving the former prime minister Ivo Sanader, who is involved in five overlapping corruption trials.Grabar-Kitarović, largely a HDZ bureaucrat until the 2015 election campaign, embraced the party’s legacy as the representative of the conservative and patriotic right, joining the lengthy protests and sit-ins of Croatian war veterans that coincided with the pre-electoral campaign. However, with her foreign education, excellent command of English and previous high-ranking position in Nato, Grabar-Kitarović stood in stark contrast to the former generals and brutish local mayors usually associated with the HDZ.Her performance in the World Cup is perhaps the clearest indicator of her role in the HDZ and Croatia’s political sphere, where the president is head of state and the country’s chief representative at home and abroad.While the prime minister, Andrej Plenković, is tasked with negotiating with the head of Russia’s Sberbank, the largest single creditor of Croatia’s biggest and most troubled conglomerate, Grabar-Kitarović exchanged jerseys with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Executive and operational powers reside in Plenković’s government. Grabar-Kitarović is focused on promoting the values that a large part of the Croatian electorate holds dear – love of country and church – and for the president, another term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca437eb6e253a8261c56288c19af6ff46d8c84c/0_160_4807_2884/master/4807.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f5840f22e47d6c7d255d08d9ab38b04","title":"france to celebrate world cup win with paris victory parade","story":"Open-top bus travels down Champs Élysées as hundreds of thousands cheer squad onFrance’s young, World Cup-winning football team have staged a victorious home-coming parade in an open-top bus down the Champs Élysées as hundreds of thousands of supporters wrapped in flags cheered them on.The 4-2 win over Croatia in Moscow on Sunday has cemented France’s reemergence as a football superpower and brought the country together. The squad were driven down the packed avenue in Paris, smiling and waving and holding up the cup as the French air force staged a flypast amid plumes of red, white and blue.City-centre Parisians and others from the capital’s banlieue suburbs swapped flags and sung the national anthem with others who had travelled from across the country.On Sunday night, after the final whistle blew in Moscow, up to 1 million supporters had gathered on the Champs Élysées. Throughout the night and into Monday cars sped around Paris with people leaning out of windows waving flags.Sissoko, 32, from the eastern outskirts of Paris, not far from where Paul Pogba grew up, brought his sons, Sadia, eight, and Hanet, six, to catch a glimpse of the team. “This is a big moment for the kids, it shows what they can dream of, who their role models can be,” he said.France has traditionally placed more pressure than most other countries on its football team as a national symbol that can fix society’s ills. The mood of unity and positivity that this erse French team has brought has been seen as a balm for a ided nation thathit by terrorism, and where the far-right Marine Le Pen won more than 10m votes in last year’s presidential election.The mood was different to 20 years ago, when France won the World Cup on home soil. That year, Zinedine Zidane’s erse team was held up as the magic fix to France’s deep-seated discrimination and identity issues, with the team labeled “black, blanc, beur” – black, white, Arab. This time, politicians accepted that it had been folly in 1998 to expect a the result of a football match to do so much. Indeed four years after the last win, Marine Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had complained there were too many black people on the team, made it to the presidential run-off.Instead, as the team bus moved past cheering crowds on the Champs Élysées, supporters said each player should be seen as an inspiration, emphasising the places where the players had grown up, from poor suburbs to rural towns. “We’re not in 1998,” said Mounir Mahjoubi, the secretary of state for digital affairs, whose parents were born in Morocco. “We’re not still celebrating ‘black, blanc, beur’, we’re celebrating brotherhood,” he said of the team.“This team is proof that today our generation doesn’t see differences, not in race, age or background – everyone is the same,” said Daphné Bada, 18, who with her friend Cyrona Ramdani, 17, had come in from a suburban town in the banlieue. Both were about to start university degrees. “This is a historic moment. We had to be here.”Eric, 45, who worked as a health and safety officer in Amiens, northern France, had brought his two sons, aged 10 and 12. “Today is all about being proud to be French,” he said.Graffiti in the city included: “Liberté, egalité, Mbappé”, a reference to the national motto and Kylian Mbappé. The 19-year-old star of the World Cup comes from Bondy in the Paris suburbs and the sports minister Laura Flessel said he had allowed young French people in the suburbs “to dare to believe in their dreams”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has recently dipped in polls after accusations that he is not doing enough for those most in need, hosted the team at the presidential palace. At the match in Moscow, he had been pictured in shirt-sleeves punching the air, hugging the players on the pitch, then addressing them in their dressing room.”He told the team: “Kids, a big thank you, you allowed us to dream … 66 million French people watched you, you are an example for all those young people, and that’s going to last all your life. You will never be the same.”There were some disturbances on Sunday night, with riot police firing teargas when a small number of people threw stones at and broke into Publicis Drugstore on the Champs Élysées, with police later clearing the area with water cannon. The interior ministry said there had been 292 arrests across France overnight.At the presidential reception for the homecoming team, Macron invited hundreds of young football players from the poorer suburbs of Paris, where several of the French team began playing football as children.Pogba led the team in several football chants on the steps to the palace garden. Macron addressed the team saying: “Never forget where you’re from. You’re from right here,” gesturing to the football trainers and volunteers from youth teams in the suburbs who had been invited.Macron may be hoping his approval ratings will rise on the back of the victory. After the 1998 win, the unpopular rightwing president Jacques Chirac enjoyed a boost in the polls. A poll for Le Journal du Dimanche before the World Cup final found that the majority of French people felt the football results had boosted the national mood.Several Paris Métro stations had their names temporarily changed to honour the team. Champs-Élysées Clemenceau station became the Deschamps-Élysées Clemenceau after the national team coach, Didier Deschamps and Victor Hugo station became Victor Hugo Lloris, after France’s goalkeeper and team captain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a11414c7f798fafae92140ce8deb16d0f88595/111_0_607_364/master/607.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf374c04b44a45caffc8bf1a9ba6983","title":"the right to sit indian law change allows women workers to rest","story":"Mainly female workforce in shops not allowed to sit, lean against a wall or use a liftCybil Wilson has worked in one of Kerala’s big, shiny, brightly-lit sari shops for 10 years.Her salary at the shop, in Trivandrum, has been consistently low but it is the pain and swelling in her legs that troubles her the most. Her employer forbids Wilson, and the other 120 female sales assistants working across the four floors, from sitting down during a 12-14 hour shift.“We can’t use the lifts either. All customers pay on the ground floor for their purchases and we have to accompany them so we are up and down the stairs all day. A few times, when we did use the lift, customers complained about having to share it with us,” said Wilson.Now the Kerala government has announced it will amend its labour laws to include a clause obliging employers to let women sit – the result of a fight by a women’s union for “irippu samara” (the right to sit in Malayalam) for these unrepresented shop workers.Most owners of sari shops and other retail outlets forbid women, the bulk of the shop workforce, to sit. Even leaning against a wall can be punished. Lunch is 30 minutes. Toilet breaks are strictly limited. Talking to colleagues can lead to salary deductions. Employers monitor CCTV footage to check for compliance.The women’s union, called Amtu, was set up by Viji Penkoot, the leader of a women’s collective, Penkootu, when the male-dominated unions in the state ignored the issue.She began agitating for the right to sit eight years ago, when a sales assistant in Kozhikode who leaned against a wall while a customer pondered which sari to buy, had her pay cut by 100 rupees (£1) for the “offence”. “The women are careful not to drink too much because they cannot go to the toilet when they want to. They get urinary infections, kidney problems. They have varicose veins and joint pain from standing. It took us a long time for the government to pay any attention to this problem,” said Penkoot. On 4 July, the Kerala state cabinet, reacting to street protests by shop assistants, announced it would amend the existing law, which fails to specify which amenities should be provided to sales assistants, to include the right to sit. “It’s our policy to protect the interests of all our women workers and this gap in the law had to be plugged,” said Thozil Bhawan, a labour commissioner. The new law will stipulate a minimum monthly starting salary of 10,000 rupees (£110), an eight-hour day, a chair or stool, an afternoon tea break, and a lunch break, with a duration yet to be decided by the Kerala cabinet, be provided."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03e93ff6e53e5600c25fe39fd5de68eecf70fc1/0_268_5421_3254/master/5421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8948685d24ba3ff69199eb38cb670d89","title":"true human cost 5 pound hand car wash modern slavery","story":"The UK’s hand car washes tend to be extremely competitive with pricing, but they have also been linked to modern slavery. Are they ever fair for workers?One night in August 2015, after a long shift at the Bubbles car wash in east London, Sandu Laurentiu was washing himself in the rat-infested shared flat provided by his employer. Shaip Nimani, 53, originally from Kosovo, had illegally bypassed the electricity meter at the property in Bethnal Green and tampered with the fuses to stop them blowing. The plumbing in the damp bathroom was not earthed. While he used the decrepit power shower, Laurentiu was electrocuted and killed.The death of the 40-year-old Romanian labourer renewed concern about conditions at thousands of hand car washes across the country. The washes, which have mushroomed in petrol stations, car parks and empty forecourts, offer cleaning for as little as £5. Often they employ as many as a dozen workers and are open for up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. There are suspicions of minimum wage, environmental, planning, and health and safety violations, tax evasion – as well as labour exploitation and modern slavery.Last year, Nimani received a four-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter. But, three years after Laurentiu’s death, and more than a decade after car washes started to become a common sight, the response to the problem is only now gathering pace. Last month, the environmental audit committee (EAC) heard the first oral evidence at an inquiry into hand car washes. MPs will spend weeks hearing from academics, industry representatives and regulators.Raids on suspected hand car washes are becoming more common. In the past month, police have swooped on sites in Somerset and Manchester. A raid at the end of June on a car wash in Newport in South Wales, ended in tragedy when Sudanese worker Mustafa Dawood, who was 23, fled on to the roof of a neighbouring factory and fell to his death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the incident.There is little agreement about how many hand car washes there are in the UK. Estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000. Less still is known about how many of these may be guilty of infringements. Mechanical car washes, with their fierce rotating bristles, used to be the go-to for drivers in a hurry. Now there is more choice, but little to inform ethical decisions. What is the true cost of a £5 car wash – and what should we be paying?The rise of hand car washes is the result of what is known as economic restructuring. Petrol stations have closed as drivers fill up at supermarkets. Pubs and their car parks have been abandoned as drinkers fill up at home. Garages and their forecourts have closed as cars become more reliable and locked into service agreements. The businesses among these that remain open, meanwhile, are finding ways to make more money out of their outdoor space.As entrepreneurs and opportunists have identified abandoned or available land – and a demand among drivers for cheap, effective car washing – changes in the labour market, partly as a result of EU migration, have supplied the workers. For many visitors, car washes are a first job. “They accept car washing for a short period while they improve their language skills and move into other industries,” says Ian Clark, a professor of work and employment at Nottingham Business School. “But there are also car-wash workers without networks who are in a dead end, working there for long periods.”The EAC heard last month that a car wash costing less than £6 could be funding modern slavery. Crude calculations illuminate the problem. A £5 car wash employing five workers for 10 hours a day would have a minimum wage bill (at £7.83 an hour for workers over 25) of £391.50. That team would need to wash 79 cars a day to bring in that kind of cash, or one car every seven and a half minutes. That’s a doable rate, but it relies on a constant flow of cars and ignores overheads – chemicals, water, equipment, rent, tax – and the need for profit.Many car washes employ more than five workers. Even if the margins can be higher on valet services, which can cost as little as £12 for a full inside-and-out clean, it’s hard to see how “from £5” pays a living wage. “Last weekend I drove past a car wash that was offering washes for £2.99,” says Darryl Dixon, the director of strategy at the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA). “But there are drivers who are only interested in getting the cheapest wash. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.”Testimony from car-wash workers is patchy but Clark and others have been able to build a picture of some of the tougher conditions on drenched forecourts. “Like nail bars and small garment manufacturers, car washes are what we call ‘hard-to-reach places’,” Clark explains. As part of a study of washes, Clark and his team spoke to workers from 45 hand car washes in the east Midlands. They found no cases of modern slavery or people trafficking, “but we have developed a theory of more routine exploitation of workers”, he says.Anecdotal evidence from elsewhere has suggested a rise in trench foot and chemical burns. At one wash, workers were reportedly paid only in the coins they were able to hoover out of car seats. Car washes that take only cash fuel suspicions of tax avoidance or organised crime. Then there is the environmental damage. “You’ve got to look out for what they’re washing on,” says Dawn Frazer, managing director of the Car Wash Advisory Service (CWAS), which has started a WashMark scheme for legitimate car washes. Tarmac, she explains, is porous. “Any chemical used in the wash is going to go straight into the subsoil.” Concrete prevents this, while a sludge trap or similar device should be used to stop chemicals entering waterways or sewers.Beyond checking for concrete and prices below £6, what can drivers do to avoid potentially problematic car washes? Frazer, who believes £9 is a reasonable minimum price for a basic wash, advises checking for the overall quality of a site. “If it’s being held together with bits of string, that’s another indicator,” she says. Nearby caravans or signs of on-site accommodation are a potential concern, as is an absence of receipts.While the scale of the problem remains largely unknown, and workers themselves report being reluctant to raise the alarm, drivers are being recruited to help identify problem sites. The church is playing an unlikely role the Anglican and Catholic churches in England have backed a new Safe Car Wash phone app. It asks drivers for a site’s location and name (if there is one), followed by a series of questions about it and its workers. It encourages drivers not to confront workers. Instead, the Church of England’s Clewer Initiative against anti-slavery, which launched the app on 4 June, shares the data with the National Crime Agency and the GLAA, among other authorities. If answers to the questions about safety gear and other observations suggests a potential problem, users are also encouraged to contact the Modern Slavery Helpline.“Too often we rush in, you’re on your phone and see all this activity, you give your £6 and drive off,” says Alastair Redfern, the bishop of Derby, who works on anti-slavery projects in the church and the House of Lords. “We’re just saying, please stop and think first.” The Clewer Initiative says the app was downloaded more than 5,000 times in its first month, while the charity Unseen, which runs the slavery helpline, said last week that 11 cases indicating 69 potential victims had been reported to it through the app.But concern about car washes that may be contravening one or several laws and regulations should not lead to assumptions about all such businesses, Frazer adds. There are legitimate businesses that offer competitive prices. That some car washes might have sub-standard drainage does not necessarily mean they are fronts of organised crime. “And if workers look a bit bedraggled, it doesn’t mean it’s all to do with modern slavery – you cannot generalise in that way,” Frazer adds.To help distinguish between the good, the bad and the not entirely legitimate, the CWAS, which is funded by industry membership, is promoting its WashMark certificate of quality and compliance. Businesses that want the badge must share their company accounts and employment and environmental practices with a visiting inspector. Regular, unannounced visits follow the award of the mark. But there were only a dozen accredited sites at the time of writing. While Frazer is training 10 new staff, and hopes to audit 120 sites in the next three months, making an impact on the industry any time soon looks like a tall order.There is also a rival scheme, which further complicates the issue. The GLAA is developing a code of practice for the estimated 500 car washes operating on supermarket car parks, which would be regulated by the supermarkets. These would represent a small fraction of the total car washes in operation, but Dixon, at the GLAA, says engaging drivers in the issue, and making them demand better car washes, creates an incentive for good businesses to improve practices and come forward to get a stamp of approval. “The ones that don’t are the ones where the greatest risk is likely to exist, and therefore we would be better able to target them,” he adds.Supermarkets are already waking up to the problem. Tesco has partnered with Waves, a car washing business based in Surrey, to provide Tesco-branded washes at dozens of its stores. But at the same time, petrol stations that had relied on mechanical washes are switching to hand washes. “It’s a case of ‘can’t beat them, join them’,” says Brian Madderson, a major critic of the hand wash industry as chairman of the Petrol Retailers and Car Wash Associations. “I’m really concerned that our members might be damaging their brands by unknowingly fostering illegal activities on their sites.”Until the host of authorities whose roles are touched by hand car washes get to grips with the problem, once they have determined its scale in the first place, drivers have to make their own choices. Frazer only visits hand car washes that she knows are compliant, “which is why my car is a bit dirty at the moment”, she says. Meanwhile, although deaths associated with car washes are rare, it is the workers who are paying the price for convenience.After Nimani was jailed for the death of Laurentiu, the victim’s brother, Marius, described his brother as a kind and loving son who spoke to their mother every week and sent money home. He added: “It appears to me that the employment laws and rules and regulations in the UK are not strong enough, and that more needs to be done to protect the welfare and wellbeing of foreign nationals, to stop incidents like this happening again.”"},{"url":null,"title":"flight tracker shows sudden descent of ryanair flight","story":"  July 14, 2018Passengers bleeding from ears and oxygen masks dropped as plane landed in Frankfurt "},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing   July 16, 2018Airline says \u0026lsquosmall number\u0026rsquo of passengers treated as a precaution after the incident "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3567114.1531768142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"5 500 year old passage tomb at dowth is find of a lifetime","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Clíodhna Ní  Lionáin, Devenish’s lead archaeologist at the passage tomb site at Dowth Hall, Co Meath. Photograph: Cyril ByrneA 5,500-year-old passage tomb uncovered at Dowth Hall in the heart of the Brú na Bóinne World Heritage site in Co Meath is “the most significant megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years”, archaeologists believe.The ancient burial chamber, believed to be about 40m in diameter and half the size of nearby Newgrange, was discovered during archaeological investigations by the agri-technology company Devenish and UCD school of archaeology.Brú na Bóinne is the area within the bend of the river Boyne that contains one of the world’s most important prehistoric landscapes. Dowth Hall and lands were acquired by Devenish in 2013.To date, two burial chambers have been discovered within the western part of the main passage tomb, over which a large stone cairn was raised.Archaeologists working on the site since May last year say the six kerbstones identified so far would have formed part of a ring of stones that followed the cairn perimeter.One kerbstone is heavily decorated with Neolithic carvings and represents “one of the most impressive discoveries of megalithic art in Ireland for decades”, the archaeologists said.Devenish’s lead architect for the project, Dr Clíodhna Ní Lionáin, said that for the archaeologists involved in the discovery, it was “very exciting” and “truly the find of a lifetime”.She said the the team was working on the theory that the tomb could have been one of the earliest ones constructed in the area. “It’s a bit smaller than the more well-known monuments like Newgrange and Knowth. It’s around half the size of Newgrange but we think it might have been slightly earlier,” she said.“But of course we need to do further investigation and try to find material that we can date fairly precisely to be sure of that theory.”Dr Ní Lionáin said the people who built the tombs would probably have been “the children or grandchildren or great grandchildren of some of the first farmers in Ireland”.“In terms of designing these monuments, they were really good architects, engineers and also astronomers, because we often get alignments on various different solstices. And we can also see from what the art we have here they were amazing artists as well. Even though we don’t know what this art means, everyone who comes here is struck by this art.”Dr Steve Davis, of the UCD school of archaeology, said it was “the most significant” megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years.He said the spate of archaeological discoveries in Brú na Bóinne in recent weeks “highlights what a globally significant place this is”. A number of other significant archaeological sites were discovered at Brú na Bóinne just last Friday during a Government-commissioned aerial survey of the heritage site.A planning application to renovate Dowth Hall, one of the most important protected structures in the Brú na Bóinne area, was lodged by Dr Owen Brennan, executive chairman of Devenish, and his wife, Prof Alice Stanton, in 2016.The 18th-century house on the 430-acre estate will become the Brennan family home and they have said it will also be used as a venue for “stimulating discussion on sustainable agriculture and promoting human and environmental health”.Dr Brennan said Devenish had invested in the farm at Dowth because of its fertile soil, its location beside the Boyne and its beautiful landscape.“It is hugely valuable, and indeed core to our company’s science-based ethos, that we preserve and protect this major heritage site for future generations.”Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan visited the site on Monday and said that “to know that this historic site will be preserved for future generations to see, understand and cherish is positive in every respect”.Dowth Hall and its lands will be open to the public on occasions throughout the year, including during Heritage Week, which runs from August 18th to 26th."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/27/TELEMMGLPICT000167700946_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqY0XMnE4berkpvWhc-fw2CHnYvmhjopjBo5wANh2lLAw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"turning fan around can help sleep better heatwave","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe unusual method of pointing a fan out of a window can help you keep cool in a heatwave digitalservices@telegraphAs Britain continues to bask in blue skies and wall-to-wall sunshine, cryophiles with a penchant for cooler climes have been exchanging tips on how to stay cool during the heatwave.They range from the bizarre, like eating chilli and painting your roof white, to practical tips likes wearing light clothes and keeping your curtains closed during the day.One particularly unconventional method championed by a New Zealand-based eco-warrior involves pointing an electric fan outside of your open bedroom window to keep cool at night.  Nelson Lebo, an eco design adviser for Palmerston North city council in the South Pacific nation’s North Island, explains the clever fan trick works by blowing the warm air stagnating inside your property outwards, while pulling cooler air in.He explained the fan should be set up just after sunset, when the temperature outside becomes cooler than inside your home.Mr Lebo, who is originally from the US, said he learnt the trick from his grandmother who used it in New Jersey during the Seventies.“Everyone knows about cross ventilation,” he told The , “but it only works when the wind is blowing and then it works best when there is a direct route for the wind to blow through a home.“What the fan does is, it forces cross ventilation, even when the wind is not blowing. A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.Donald Trump\u0026#39s comments on Putin at summit condemned as \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 and \u0026#39 treasonous\u0026#39One million over 50s lost to the workforce because of age bias, MPs warnChildren’s books must have more black characters, Arts Council funded report says True story of how Prince Philip\u0026#39s DNA solved Russian Romanov murder mystery told by Science Museum Facebook moderators accused of turning blind eye to under-age accounts Hernia patients forced to prove debilitating pain before granted operations on the NHSPolice failing to record thousands of crimes including violence and domestic abuse, watchdog findsRussian woman charged in Washington DC with spying on behalf of MoscowTrump-Putin summit: How presidents put Cold War past behind them to put on a united frontWho Do You Think You Are? review: war, japes and illegitimate children - Lee Mack\u0026#39s past was more than greasepaint and laughterPrivate school overseas \u0026#39franchises\u0026#39 are on the rise, report findsComment: Donald Trump is the US president Vladimir Putin has always dreamed of Russia split over remains of last Tsar on 100th anniversary of his murderDavid Davis: Britain risks \u0026#39giving up a real future\u0026#39 over BrexitRussian cyber hackers \u0026#39targeted\u0026#39 police inquiry into Skripal nerve agent attackPlans for bypass to avoid rush hour delays of just six minutes are branded \u0026#39heavy handed\u0026#39 by campaignersTrump and Putin unite in denying any Russian collusion during US elections at key Helsinki summitBBC left with a last minute vacancy after pundit qualifies for The Open Fresh Labour row as 68 British rabbis accuse party of \u0026#39ignoring Jewish community\u0026#39 over new anti-Semitism code We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers.

If not, we just pretend that we are blind and we don’t know what underage looks like,” a trainer tells an undercover reporter posing as a prospective moderator for Facebook.Even if the content contains images of self-harm, moderators have to treat the under-aged child as if they were an adult and send them advice about tackling self-harm rather than reporting their account.“If this person was a kid, like a 10-year-old we don’t care, we still action the ticket as if it were an adult,” says the trainer in the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation to be screened on Tuesday evening.Half of 11 and 12-year-olds – some 700,000 children - have a social media profile despite most sites having a minimum age of 13, according to the regulator Ofcom.The Daily  is campaigning for a statutory duty of care to force the companies to protect children from online harms.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreFacebook said it did not allow under 13s on its site and would take action if someone reported an under-aged child to them. It said it was investigating why moderators acted as they did.  The film, which contains claims Facebook’s commercial drive to boost user numbers overrides safety concerns, focuses on CPL Resources, a Dublin contractor whose moderators decide if content should be deleted, ignored or marked as disturbing which means it can be restricted to over 18s.It reveals violent content including graphic images and video of child abuse or assaults on children is allowed to remain on the site despite being flagged by users as inappropriate and requests for removal.The undercover reporter is told one video of a man punching and stamping on a toddler aged two or three complied with Facebook’s terms and conditions because although it was “disturbing”, it did not have a celebratory caption.Anti-child abuse campaigner Nicci Astin said she was appalled it was not removed when she requested it in 2012. The video of what turned out to be a stepfather assaulting the child and who was jailed for a year was viewed 40,000 times.The NSPCC’s Andy Burrows said the images were “shocking” and disputed Facebook’s defence that allowing such videos could help identify and rescue abused children. “A copy could be retained to help any police investigation,” he said. “It exacerbates the trauma the child might feel.”A video of a young girl beating up another and shared over 1000 times to the distress of the victim and her parents was not removed because it had a caption condemning the violence. Any video of “physical bullying” with minors is allowed if it has a “condemnatory caption”, the reporter is told. Duty of care puffThe undercover reporter is also told racially abusive comments against ethnic or religious communities are allowed provided they are described as immigrants.Saying: “F*** off back to your own countries” below a video of Muslims is therefore allowed because Facebook regards it as part of the political debate over immigration.Facebook’s trainee moderators were also told a cartoon of a woman apparently drowning a girl who the caption states has got a crush on a “negro” as her first boyfriend is also permitted.One moderator tells the reporter: “If you start censoring too much then people lose interest in the platform…it’s all about making money at the end of the day.”Venture capitalist Roger McNamee, one of Facebook’s first investors and mentor to founder Mark Zuckerberg, said its business model relied on extreme content being posted on its site as this secured more users and boosted advertising revenues. “It’s really extreme, really dangerous form of content that attracts the most highly engaged people on the platform,” he said. “Facebook has learned that the people on the extremes can often provoke 50 or 100 other people and so they want as much extreme content as they can get.”Facebook denied posting extreme content to secure more users but aimed to provide a “safe, secure” environment for sharing content.It said it had removed the assault video as soon as it knew the child was safe and admitted the negro cartoon was inappropriate. It launched a review of contractors\u0027 training and introduced refresher training to tackle any shortcomings.CLP Resources said it was investigating the allegations and had instigated refresher programmes for its trainers.Duty of Care CampaignDonald Trump\u0026#39s comments on Putin at summit condemned as \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 and \u0026#39 treasonous\u0026#39One million over 50s lost to the workforce because of age bias, MPs warnChildren’s books must have more black characters, Arts Council funded report says True story of how Prince Philip\u0026#39s DNA solved Russian Romanov murder mystery told by Science Museum Hernia patients forced to prove debilitating pain before granted operations on the NHSPolice failing to record thousands of crimes including violence and domestic abuse, watchdog findsRussian woman charged in Washington DC with spying on behalf of MoscowTrump-Putin summit: How presidents put Cold War past behind them to put on a united frontPrivate school overseas \u0026#39franchises\u0026#39 are on the rise, report findsWho Do You Think You Are? review: war, japes and illegitimate children - Lee Mack\u0026#39s past was more than greasepaint and laughterComment: Donald Trump is the US president Vladimir Putin has always dreamed of Russia split over remains of last Tsar on 100th anniversary of his murderDavid Davis: Britain risks \u0026#39giving up a real future\u0026#39 over BrexitRussian cyber hackers \u0026#39targeted\u0026#39 police inquiry into Skripal nerve agent attackPlans for bypass to avoid rush hour delays of just six minutes are branded \u0026#39heavy handed\u0026#39 by campaignersTrump and Putin unite in denying any Russian collusion during US elections at key Helsinki summitBBC left with a last minute vacancy after pundit qualifies for The Open Fresh Labour row as 68 British rabbis accuse party of \u0026#39ignoring Jewish community\u0026#39 over new anti-Semitism code First hosepipe ban of summer to hit north-west England after weeks of firefighting on Saddleworth MoorWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/gettyimages-874683314.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/gettyimages-874683314.jpg","title":"amazon prime day 2018 down not working dogs deals offers sales","story":"Created with Sketch.Amazon down on Prime Day: Site not working as people shown dogs instead of dealsThere are a wide variety of dogs to meet – but none of them make up for missing out on shopping for sales and offersClick to followThe Independent TechAmazon has stopped working on the site\u0027s most important day of the year.As Amazon Prime Day began, shoppers took to the site to check out the time-limited deals that run through 16 and 17 July.But instead they only saw a variety of dogs, which Amazon uses as its error page when something doesn\u0027t load properly.Numerous users joked that the dogs were very cute and nice – but that they had come to shop, and not for a new canine.There doesn\u0027t appear to be a way of getting around the problem, though refreshing the page should sometimes make it come back to life.Instead, users are probably best advised to get acquainted with all of the various hounds that show on the error page.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani.

Throughout most of prehistory, food gathering and processing appears to have been carried out in order to ensure that food consumption was safe and provided more energy than it cost people to make. It was essentially carried out to produce a net energy gain.But now, archaeologists have discovered the world’s oldest bread – that was cooked and probably eaten in what appears to have been some sort of ultra-early ceremonial or religious complex.The discovery – at an archaeological site known as Shubayqa 1 in what is now desert in northeast Jordan – is particularly significant because wild cereal bread does not produce a net nutritional gain.It would have almost certainly cost the prehistoric people at Shubayqa 1\u0026nbspmore energy to make than they would have gained by consuming it.It is therefore likely that it was among the very first special\u0026nbspfoods to be made not primarily for nutrition – but mainly for cultural and potentially social or ideological reasons.The bread – made 3,500 years before the birth of agriculture –\u0026nbspis from an area and a time associated with the world’s oldest monumental stone buildings (constructed between 15,500 and 14,000 years ago).The buildings – which were not typical of the majority of houses of that era – were probably constructed for communal ceremonies and rituals (perhaps including feasting associated with celebrating or commemorating the dead). The rare stone-built complexes normally have human burials adjacent to or beneath them.The particular building that the bread was discovered in was around eight metres in diameter – and had a well-made stone-paved interior.In the building’s hearth, the archaeologists found evidence of food consumption (given the probable purpose of the building, potentially communal feasting).The food debris includes gazelle, water fowl and hare bones, wild mustard seeds, charred tubers and fragments of at least three different types of unleavened flatbread. It is therefore likely that any special communal meals celebrated there involved feasting on meat and roasted tubers wrapped in or eaten with flat bread in much the same way that people still often consume food in the Middle East and South Asia today.It is also conceivable that this probably ritualised early conception of bread in the Middle East 14,400 years ago represents the genesis of the long-standing religious importance of bread consumption in (or originally associated with) that region.In Judaism, ritually important bread was kept in a portable House of God (a sophisticated tent known as the Tabernacle) before the first great stone temple was built in Jerusalem – and of course special bread is still eaten every Friday evening throughout the Jewish world and a type of unleavened flatbread (called matzo) is still eaten by Jews at Passover.In Catholicism, unleavened communion bread is regarded as part of the body of Jesus – and in Lebanese Arab Christian tradition, a special bread called qurban is still used in ceremonies to commemorate the dead.At least three or four different types of flatbread have been discovered at Shubayqa 1.\u0026nbspA total of 254 fragments were found in the hearth of which 100 were analysed. Of these, only 24 yielded data on their composition. Of that sample, 75 per cent\u0026nbspwere made purely of wild wheat (probably wild Einkorn), 12.5 per cent\u0026nbsppurely from wild barley and 12.5 per cent\u0026nbspfrom a mixture of wild wheat and the tubers of a species of the large bull-rush-like plant, sedge.However, because lots of mustard seeds were also found in the hearth (and it is known from much later Middle Eastern evidence that such seeds were used in bread-making), it is conceivable that some of the other bread fragments at the site were made from wheat (or barley) mixed with mustard seeds.It is likely that barley was the most common wild grass available in the Shubayqa area at that time, and yet the early bread makers at the site appear to have chosen quite deliberately, in the main, to gather wheat. That may be a very significant choice – because wild wheat seeds have much more gluten in them than wild barley and would therefore have made bread dough with a greater degree of plasticity, thus allowing the making of much thinner flatbreads. The bread fragments discovered suggest that they were successfully making flatbreads which were just 5-7 millimetres thick.The entire process of bread-making was (and indeed still sometimes is) nutritionally relatively uneconomic. Harvesting wild cereals, separating the seeds, grinding them, making the dough, flattening the dough and cooking it was an energy and time consuming activity which would not, on consumption, have produced a net energy gain for the people of Shubayqa 1.The Shubayqa discovery may well therefore represent a profound change in human eating practice – away from the purely nutritionally utilitarian and towards a more culturally, socially and perhaps ideologically determined culinary tradition that is the norm throughout most of the world today.The site has been excavated by a team headed by Dr Tobias Richter of the University of Copenhagen. However, the analysis and identification of the bread was carried out by Lara Gonzalez Carretero of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology and Dr Amaia Arranz Otaegui of the University of Copenhagen.The Institute of Archaeology’s Prof Dorian Fuller, a leading expert on prehistoric cereals, said: “This discovery demonstrates that food became something that was valued for more than just calories. It reveals that people over 14,000 years ago had begun to consume food for social, cultural and potentially ideological reasons.”The discovery is also very important because it predates the first agriculture by some 3,500 years. All the cereals being harvested at Shubayqa 14,400 years ago were wild varieties, almost certainly growing in wild stands.The discovery suggests that bread-making probably in the end helped motivate people to start cultivating and domesticating cereals – a development that ultimately led to the birth of agriculture. That is the opposite to what academics had previously thought. Up till now, prehistorians had believed that agriculture led to the invention of bread. The new discovery suggests that the truth is likely to have been the other way round.“The production of a bread-based cuisine was one of the motivations behind people developing agriculture in the Middle East. It is from the Middle East that agriculture and bread spread to Europe and North Africa,” said Professor Fuller.In the 15th millennium BC bread was almost certainly a totally new food, although the relatively rare harvesting of wild cereals for toasting and possible use in porridge form had occurred, perhaps intermittently, since around 23,000 years ago in the Middle East and in China.“Shabayqa 1 is important not just because it has the earliest evidence for bread but also because it has some of the earliest stone buildings in the world,” said the director of the excavation, Dr Tobias Richter, associate professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at Copenhagen University.The discovery of the world’s oldest bread at the Shubayqa 1 site\u0026nbspis being published\u0026nbspin the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u0026nbspThe prehistoric bread discovered at Shubayqa 1 is some 5,000 years older than the previously oldest known bread, also from the Middle East.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They do not change that Chequers agreement.”Nevertheless, the Brexit white paper – published only four days ago – appeared to rule out a requirement for\u0026nbspthe EU to agree reciprocal arrangements.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union It said the two sides would have to “agree a mechanism for the remittance of relevant tariff revenue”, but added: “The UK is not proposing that the EU applies the UK’s tariffs and trade policy at its border for goods intended for the UK.”Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP and supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “First Trump humiliated the prime minister and this week it’s his British fan club – Theresa May has caved in yet again.”The controversy blew up as the government refused to deny rumours that the summer recess could be brought forward – to head off any backbench plot to bring down the prime minister.Liam Fox’s Brexit trade bill set to crush disabled people UK could lose track of thousands of EU migrants after BrexitTheresa May’s new Brexit and foreign ministers stay away from EU talksEU net migration hits four-year low in wake of Brexit, figures showEx-minister becomes first senior Tory to call for second Brexit voteA motion will be brought forward on Tuesday to end the parliamentary term on Thursday, Commons sources have said, thereby ditching plans to sit on Monday and Tuesday next week.Ms May’s Tory opponents are collecting signatures to force a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the Conservative party, with 48 required.If MPs are sent on their summer holidays this week, it will probably be impossible to stage that contest – giving the prime minister respite until the autumn at least.No 10 confirmed the government was accepting all four ERG amendments to the Taxation Bill, formerly known as the Customs Bill – just hours after Greg Clark, the business secretary, insisted it would not.One would enshrine in law that there can be no customs border down the Irish Sea – proposed by the EU as the “backstop” to avoid a hard Irish land border, without which there will be no withdrawal agreement.Although Ms May has ruled out a border in the sea, she has been inching towards accepting the backstop on the basis that it would never be needed.Another\u0026nbspamendment would require the UK to have a separate VAT regime from the EU, which would kill off any prospect of Britain remaining in a customs union.A No 10 spokesman defended accepting the amendments – which were debated at last week’s Independent subscribers’ event –\u0026nbspsaying: “We believe they are consistent with the white paper we published last week.”But the cave-in triggered an extraordinary breakdown of Tory discipline in the Commons, as pro and anti-EU Tories traded insults.When Anna Soubry mentioned Margaret Thatcher, Brexiteer Edward Leigh said: “I knew Margaret Thatcher. I worked for Margaret Thatcher. My honourable friend ain’t no Margaret Thatcher.”Ms Soubry condemned the ERG’s “wrecking amendments” and accused the prime minister of being “frightened of somewhere in the region of 40” hard Brexit supporters.“This government is in grave danger of not just losing the plot, but losing a considerable amount of support from the people of this country.”Peter Dowd MP, a Labour treasury spokesman, said: “It took two years for the prime minister to reach her Chequers deal, but only two days for it to fall apart.“The white paper lies in tatters, the government is in free fall and Theresa May has no authority left.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So it is quite hard to find any kind of hard evidence that is getting in the government’s way.”The government has recently\u0026nbspchanged the rules slightly and allowed\u0026nbspsome onshore wind projects to compete for subsidies, but only those\u0026nbspoperating in remote islands off the coast of Scotland.In response to the YouGov\u0026nbsppoll, a\u0026nbspspokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Our renewables sector is a British success story and we already have 7,000 onshore wind turbines across the UK, generating enough electricity to power seven million homes.\u0026nbsp“The government does not believe new large scale onshore wind power is right for England.

But the UK does not have any way of actually getting them into space, meaning they have to be shipped elsewhere to be launched.Now the British government hopes that this announcement and others will allow the country to launch its plans for a flourishing space industry in the UK.“The announcement of a strategic partnership between Virgin Orbit and Cornwall Spaceport is great news for the region and the UK’s ambitions for regular, reliable and responsible access to space, said UK science minister Sam Gyimah.\u0026nbspThis partnership could see Virgin Orbit’s innovative horizontal launch technology helping the UK’s small satellite industry access space from the convenience of a Spaceport in Cornwall.We will work with both partners to support their ambitions, as we take the next steps in our national spaceflight programme as part of the government’s modern Industrial strategy.”Horizontal launches such as those that will happen in Cornwall\u0026nbspare different from the famous flights that takeoff from Kennedy Space Centre\u0026nbspand elsewhere. Instead of standing up from the beginning, the rocket is attached to a plane and carried up into the air – from there, the rocket separates and flies off into space, carrying the satellite with it.Virgin claims that horizontal launches will allow for cheaper spaceflight, since they mean launches can take place away from busy launchpads.There will soon be vertical rockets taking off from the UK, however, if a plan to launch a new spaceport in Scotland is successful.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay. So where better to host it than in England, where the beautiful game was born?We have the stadiums, the transport and the passion — attributes shamefully ignored in recent years by Fifa.It is time that football’s greatest show finally came home. THE British divers who risked their lives to save the trapped Thai boys are true heroes.Their extraordinary, selfless, mission was utterly courageous, especially after a colleague died during the operation.Such heroics should be recognised.

The tweet has since been deleted.The American businessman then attacked the 63-year-old expat claiming he never saw him at the cave during the high-profile rescue mission.When asked about Musks outrageous comments, Unsworth said today: I believe he has called me a paedophile.Well, by definition, you’re rescuing 12 young boys, by definition that puts everybody in the same context.He revealed he is now considering legal action against Musk adding I think people realise what sort of guy he is.“There is no justification. At the end of the day we were here to rescue these young boys,”added.Unsworth said he had saved copies of Musk’s tweets  - seen by many of his 22m followers - and believed he had “lost the plot”.“I have a lot of support from people around the world astonished by his unfounded comments,” he told the .“I don’t know the guy, never met the guy, and don’t want to meet the guy,” he said of Musk.The caver said he would make a decision on legal action when he flies back to the UK this week, but said the episode with Musk aint finished.Hes just a PR stunt merchant - thats all he is, Unsworth added.Vernons elderly mother, who lives in Essex, also hit out at Musks slur.Vera Unsworth, 88, said: “That’s stupid, that is the last thing he is.  It’s disgusting, absolutely disgusting that. He wants his mouth taped up.I don’t know if Vernon will seek legal recourse, if he has any sense he will. It’s disgusting coming from a millionaire as well.“He probably thinks money doesn’t hurt him and he can get away with anything. I hope he does take legal action but the point will be he has got the money and Vernon hasn’t.Social media users have now expressed their outrage over Musks comments.One person tweeted: I used to admire #elonmusk and what he contributes to technology, calling another person a pedo without proof is disgusting.Another said: The implication that the only reason someone would be an expat in Thailand is because theyre a pedo is so offensive on so many levels. An insult to Thailand and its wonderful people.Claus Rasmussen, a Danish instructor at Blue Label Diving in Phuket, called the attack “inappropriate” and praised Unsworth’s rescue role: “He was the guy who effectively mapped most of that cave.”The Brit, who co-led the operation to save the schoolboys from the cave, sparked the tirade when he told CNN Musks sub plan  had absolutely no chance of working.The submarine, I believe, was about five-foot-six long, rigid, so it wouldnt have gone round any corners or any obstacles, he said.In a string of tweets responding to a journalist mentioning Mr Unsworths comments, Musk said: Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves.Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Their navy seals escorted us in - total opposite of wanting us to leave.Water level was actually very low \u0026amp still (not flowing) - you could have literally swum into Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how kids got in. If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video.Huge credit to pump and generator team. Unsung heroes here.You know what, dont even bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo.Mr Unsworth spent years exploring the Tham Luang cave system where the boys were trapped for 17 days, meaning he had expert knowledge that was vital to the rescue.He acquired his love of potholing in the Yorkshire Dales and was the first foreign rescuer at the scene.The expat told the Sunday Times: “The search was going nowhere, the conditions were worsening by the hour and we had no idea where the boys were.“We needed the expertise of top world-class cave divers to look for these kids and we needed it fast. If we hadn’t called them in then, it would have been too late.”Unsworth knew some of the chambers where they might have sought refuge would by then have been completely flooded.“If they’d been caught in the wrong place, they’d have stood no chance,” he said as he reflected on the operation.Unsworth, who is not a diver, was among the teams that carried stretchers during the three-day operation. He was among the last to leave the cave on Tuesday night.A former Thai Navy SEAL died while working to rescue the boys. Samarn Kunan ran out of oxygen while attempting to return to the command centre.

Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?”.Musk delivered a speech at a conference in 2010 and saved his best line for last - following it with a trademark Bond villain-esque cackle.But before the violins come out, with those billions in the bank, he doesnt really have a lot to moan about.Musk wants to be the first person to colonise the Red Planet, and hopes his SpaceX rocket will complete missions there as soon as next year - and have humans living - and dying - there by 2024.Clearly not a fan of a relaxing week in the sun, its easy to see why Musk reportedly took off just two weeks of holiday between 2003 and 2015.This commitment to work is something he expects from his workers too, having allegedly lambasted one of his employees for being away for the birth of their child. Musk has since denied the claims.With all his cash, Musk inevitably is able to buy any book he wants to, which is why it was somewhat surprising when he came out in support of Wikipedia for being accurate during a rambling keynote speech in Austin, Texas in 2013.Musk has admitted that his demanding daily routine means he often works through meals - usually opting for a Mars bar (of course) over a healthy breakfast.This sounds like something a sci-fi plot but there is apparently some science behind the jargon. Speaking on the Late Show on 2015, Musk told host Stephen Colbert his ambitious plan to transform Mars into an earth-like planet by releasing huge amounts of heat which in turn would melt the carbon dioxide ice at the poles and be possible for water to exist.Hes had trouble with them before, when he travelled to the capital Moscow in 2001 to buy rockets. He was spat at and asked to leave due for offering an outrageously low price.Grimes and Musks odd pairing apparently happened after they were both poking fun at AI in a series of abstract flirty tweets in April and May.Us mere mortals arent exactly sure what pretentious Musk meant by this - and the addition of the dragon emoji is simply strange.Who knows what weird and wonderful things Musks barmy brain is going to come up with next - but you can guarantee it will be out of this world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first ever officially identified British meteotsunami hit the Cornish coastline in June 2011.Professor David Tappin of the British Geological Survey said: Most tsunamis are geological, where you have a vertical movement on the seabed which can be caused by an earthquake, like in Japan in 2011, or a landslide.Meteotsunamis, however, are created by weather. You need a small, rapid change in atmospheric pressure of just a few millibars, if you get one of these then it can change the sea surface elevation by a few centimetres."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420905377-e1531774409462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit card is already on the table for theresa may the widely misunderstood wto","story":"In particular, by tying us into EU regulatory standards on goods, it would make it difficult to secure Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including the United States.Nevertheless, you could argue that this minimal Brexit is better than nothing, and some Leavers have. But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

There is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.The spokesman said Mrs May was very clear that the proposal we put forward at Chequers delivers on the will of the people in the referendum.Yesterday the former Prime Minister Tony Blair backed a similar three-optioned plan, describing the plan as a mush and the worst of both worlds.He said: This is where True remainers and true leavers make common cause.Ms Greenings comments comes with Theresa May facing open rebellion from the other end of the Conservative party - as Eurosceptics threaten to bring down the PM over her soft Brexit vision.Meanwhile, Mrs Mays allies have launched a frantic bid to shore up her premiership - as party chiefs rang around grassroots activists and Tory members who are livid with her plans.Ms Greening - who quit the Cabinet in January after being moved from her Education brief - says that it will be “unacceptable” for MPs to impose a compromise on the electorate.She said voters should be presented with three choices - the prime minister’s negotiated deal, staying in the EU or a clean break.Ms Greening is said to have the support of other Remain-backing Tories including Amber Rudd, the former home secretary.Today chief Remainer rebel Dominic Grieve also wrote in support of Britain changing its mind on Brexit.Although he admits that the PMs deal is far from ideal, in an article for the Evening Standard he wrote: In a deeply divided country we must either work together to get the best deal we can — and this needs compromise — or accept that Brexit cannot be implemented and think again about what we are doing.Last night at least 20 Eurosceptic Tory MPs said they were ready to flout Downing Street and back four “rebel” amendments to the Government’s Customs Bill in the Commons today.One furious MP said: “Theresa May had the chance to be the Prime Minister who delivered Brexit. Now she’s the Prime Minister who f***** it up.”Separately, the PM suffered her eighth resignation in nine days as Robert Courts, the successor to David Cameron in Witney, Oxon, quit as a ministerial aide in protest at her Brexit plan.And in his most savage attack yet, hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg branded the PM a “Remainer who has remained a Remainer”.Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was said to be weighing up whether to pile on pressure with a dramatic resignation speech on Wednesday. Last night he called on Britain to “believe in itself after Brexit” in his first public comments since resigning.He wrote in the  that the nation should “rediscover the spirit of dynamism” from the Victorian era.Mr Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary a week ago along with Brexit Secretary David Davis over Theresa May’s Brexit plans.The “facts” have changed, they shriek. Except they haven’t. Theresa May’s proposal to the EU isn’t the grim “reality” of Brexit. It is merely what happens when negotiated ineptly, by Remainers.They further argue we should choose between no-deal, Mrs May’s proposal or staying in. Why? The first vote determined we were leaving. The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself."},{"url":null,"title":"children left tears theme park dinosaur day one t rex","story":"Outraged parents bombarded Funland At The Tropicanas Facebook page with angry messages following the free one-day event on Saturday.The event had been billed as a day of everything dinosaur related - but transport issues meant a large part of the exhibition had not arrived at the Weston-Super-Mare attraction.The ad for the event read: Come and join us for a day of everything Dinosaur related with lots to see and do!Mum Charlene Harris said: Dinosaur Day suggests more than one dinosaur!

Not ideal conditions today - there were lots of jellfyfish blooms and rain squalls along the way.Yesterday\u0027s final swim was a disappointment. We picked the wrong current to follow around the last section of The Lizard - the most southerly point in Great Britain - so after one hour and 20 minutes of hard graft, I\u0027d made virtually no progress.After the poor swim, we anchored out at sea so we could catch an early tide this morning. However, we finally found success! Our craft\u0027s skipper, Stephen Praetorius, and I managed to locate the missing offshore current, which meant I could fly 3.4 miles (5.5km) in one hour and 20 minutes.We are now back on track and we are definitely one happy crew again. My support vessel Aquila has travelled to Falmouth for much needed water and supplies. We are now down to our emergency water rations.I went out again this evening and swam straight into a good current, swimming 3.2 miles (5.1km).A pod of four dolphins including two young ones joined me for a few minutes, and were only metres away.I could hear their clicking under the surface.:: Day four - 4 miles (6.5km)Today was a crucial day for the first week of The Long Swim.I rounded Lizard Point, the most southerly point in Great Britain and a place renowned for its treacherous waters.Although things appeared calm on the surface, they were rather more turbulent underneath.Whirlpools and eddies caused an up-swelling of cold water. The temperature when the swim began was 16C (61F), and when I came out of the water after 79 minutes it had dropped to 12C (54F). Although our images show me swimming straight towards the rocks, the tide was actually perpendicular, pushing me 90 degrees sideways.Big up to skipper Stephen Praetorius, who navigated our craft and me safely through on the morning spring tide.I have never experienced such strong currents. It was like swimming in a flooding river.This evening swim then started well - we saw pods of dolphins and a sunfish - but after that it didn\u0027t go to plan. I started swimming on the wrong current, which made me swim even slower than I would have done if there\u0027d been no current at all.After struggling against counter-eddies for nearly an hour and a half I had covered only a couple of kms.I made the call to stop and try again first thing in the morning - a move we had not planned. This means we couldn\u0027t motor to Falmouth for the evening to replace our water, power and get food. We have now run out of water and are on our emergency supply bottles, having anchored in the small village of Coverack.The plan for tomorrow is to do a swim early to make up for the lost time.:: Day three - 9 miles (14.5km)Glassy sea on a beautiful Saturday in Mounts Bay, with a perfect spring tide current, which helped propel me toward Lizard Point.The crew continued fine-tuning the jellyfish watch and are now on a rota. It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare. I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting!Today was the first time we have encountered big ships - there was a row of three oil tankers anchored on the eastern end of the bay. Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.This evening was all about the Lizard. Do we shoot it tonight, making the best that the spring tide can give, or do we take a measured approach and leave it for the morning?Today\u0027s swim was shorter, but fast, sometimes I was swimming at over four knots - that\u0027s 7.2 kph.Overall another happy day, as we say goodbye to Mounts Bay.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km) Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after I got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-papers-17-july_4363883.jpg?20180716220730 ","title":"world cup 2018 russia came out on top for crumbling myths and prejudices","story":"But it soon became clear that, for the World Cup at least, that couldn\u0027t have been further from the truth... and the England fans began to book their flights.Which meant at the world famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the eve of the final, president Putin could reflect on his myth-busting efforts.He said: \"We are grateful to the millions of kind words that the guests of the tournament addressed to Russia and our people. \"We are glad that they liked its hospitality and openness, nature, culture and traditions of our big country.

In 45 eye-popping minutes, Trump utterly trashed the US intelligence services in front of the country that, many would say, poses the biggest threat to those services. Meanwhile he showered Putin with warm words, speaking of the end of the Cold War and suggesting he\u0027d personally improved their relationship. Putin even openly said he wanted Trump to win the 2016 election - before adding he didn\u0027t hack it, of course. Here are the most eye-popping moments from that press conference in Helsinki. 1. When Trump showered Putin with a diplomatic lovebomb  Normally Donald Trump speaks off the cuff, saying whatever comes into his head. But today the US President so diplomatic he was more Dalai Lama than Donald Trump. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than risk peace in pursuit of politics, he proclaimed, like a sermon. Diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility, he added. 2. But trashed his own intelligence services - in front of Russia  While he had praise for the Russia relationship, Trump was utterly damning of his own intelligence services. The press conference came after US authorities issued an indictment for 12 alleged Russian spies in the probe into hacking during the 2016 Presidential election. Special counsel Robert Mueller claimed hackers tried for the first time to hack an e-mail server used by Hillary Clinton\u0027s personal office on 27 July 2016. That same day, Trump had said: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. But the US President declared today: There was no collusion - I didn\u0027t know the President. There was nobody to collude with. Trump repeatedly mentioned the Russia probe, basically taking the same line as Putin and branding it a disaster for our country. What happened to Hillary Clinton\u0027s e-mails? Gone, just gone he said. He branded some evidence given in the probe a “disgrace to the FBI” and a “total witch hunt”, adding: We ran a brilliant campaign and that’s why I’m President. 3. When he even suggested the Russia probe made NUCLEAR WAR more likely  Trump said: We won that race. And it’s a shame there could be even a little bit of a cloud over it. People know that, people understand it, but the main thing - and we discussed this also - is zero collusion. And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship between the two largest nuclear powers in the world. We have 90% of nuclear power between the two countries. It’s ridiculous what’s going on with the probe.  Donald Trump suggests probe into Russian election interference has made nuclear war more likely  4. When he boasted he\u0027s changed the dire relationship in 4 hours  The US President told reporters: Our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed as of about four hours ago. Truly there is peace in our time. 5. When Trump, er, believed Putin\u0027s assurance there was no election meddling  Vladimir Putin said there was no election meddling. And Donald Trump seemed to agree. Putin said: (Trump) touched upon the theme of Russia\u0027s so-called meddling (in the 2016 U.S. election). I had to repeat what I\u0027ve said before, that the Russian state has never interfered and has no intention to interfere. Trump later said: President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. 6. And his assurance there\u0027s no pee tape  There was a super-awkward moment when Vladimir Putin was asked if the Russian state has any compromising material on Trump. It of course comes after infamous claims that Trump watched prostitutes urinate on a hotel bed on a visit to the country. But Putin insisted no one even warned me he was in Moscow at the time, adding: It’s hard to imagine nonsense on a bigger scale than this. Trump added confidently: If they had it, it would have been out long ago. 7. When Putin openly said he wanted Donald Trump to win the US election  Vladimir Putin has said he wanted Donald Trump to win the US Presidential election. Asked if he wanted Trump to win the 2016 election, or if he directed any Russian officials to help him do that, President Putin replied: Yes, I did, because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal. He later added: President Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russian-US relationship. And it\u0027s clear a certain part of American society felt sympathetic about it. Isn\u0027t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us? 8. When Putin gave Trump an official World Cup football - and Trump threw it at Melania  Handing over the football, President Putin told the US President: The ball is in your court. Donald Trump told reporters that the ball would be a present for his son Barron. In his speech the US President praised the hosting of the tournament. He said: I want to congratulate Russian President Putin for hosting one of the best ever World Cups. A great job. 9. When Putin said Russian officials should be questioned - by Russian officials  The Russian president’s idea turned out to be quite alarming. It follows a string of indictments from the US Department of Justice on Friday, officially accusing Russian Government actors of hacking the Democratic Party’s e-mails before the election. Putin’s plan is to allow Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team to request evidence from Russian officials. But Putin said any questioning of Russian officials should be conducted by…Russian officials. He did offer to let DoJ officials to “sit in” on the interviews. But there was a catch - he said Russia should be allowed to sit in on questioning of US government officials too. 10. When Trump brilliantly understated Russia\u0027s natural gas advantage  Donald Trump insisted “we will be competing when it comes to the pipeline”. He was referring to Russia\u0027s Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline to Europe which he has been highly critical of. But the US President did admit Russia may have a slight advantage when it comes to delivering it - in unusually understated fashion. I think we’ll compete successfully though there is a little advantage locationally, he said. There is, of course, the small matter of the North Atlantic. 11.

The party\u0027s key policy-making group, the National Policy Forum, is set to be scrapped as part of a plan which will be voted on at the Party\u0027s ruling NEC tomorrow. Labour\u0027s \u0027democracy review\u0027 also includes plans to let candidates stand for leader with just 5% of MPs\u0027 support, rather than the current 10%.  This threshold was already lowered from 15% after a row at a previous Labour conference, where some members wanted it cut to 5%.  Given the current make up of the membership it all but guarantees a successor to Jeremy Corbyn from the left of the party.  But signs are that other parts of the review, which would have seen Labour council leaders chosen by the local membership, instead of their fellow councillors, have been watered down after a huge backlash.  Sources now suggest the change will be \u0027piloted\u0027 in just a few areas.  Abolishing the NPF, which was brought in under Tony Blair , is one of a number of plans which would reverse reforms which took away power from members and which were begun under Neil Kinnock in a bid to oust the Militant faction from the Party and which New Labour extended.   A Labour Party Source, said:    The National Policy Forum is a Blair-era tool to manage members and trade unions, not to use the skills and creativity of Labour members and affiliates to develop policy to transform Britain.    Plans are also set to scrap what\u0027s known as the “contemporary criteria” or “three-year” rule. Currently if a CLP passes a constitutional amendment (a rule change), it is not debated until the following year\u0027s conference. Now, it is proposed that the contemporary criteria be abolished and constitutional amendments be debated the year they are submitted. The new plans would see Jeremy Corbyn cede power to the membership.     One of the key changes is to make annual conference the sovereign body when it comes to policy making - in a move likely to be popular with the party membership who have for years complained about the neutering of the annual party gathering. Instead of the NPF, which many argue has become defunct in recent years and which was overlooked by subsequent leaders,party sources say it will be replaced by a people powered policy process.      Plans are also in place for a Policy Committee on the NEC, which has become a more and more powerful element of the Party in recent years.

But they are changing, and the Government is committed to helping communities adapt.  “High streets of the future will still be commercial centres, but consumers now look for a wider range of experiences, from leisure to health services. “Our future high streets may well feature more homes, childcare centres and gyms to bring people back and ensure that they keep returning.” Chaired by Sir John Timpson, boss of shoe repair service Timpson, the panel will look at what consumers and communities – and young people in particular – need from their high streets.

The Prime Minister narrowly avoided a Commons humiliation by giving in to Brexiteer Tories.  After fearing the Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, had the Parliamentary numbers to win amendments on the customs bill, Mrs May decided to adopt those clauses as part of the bill.   This sparked a backlash from pro-EU MPs, who said the PM had “capitulated”.  Her majority was slashed to just three as pro-European Tories protested about the Prime Minister’s concessions by voting against her.  The first of those amendments, which would prevent the UK collecting duties for the EU unless Brussels agreed reciprocal arrangements passed with 305 votes in favour, and 302 against.  There were 14 Tory rebels who voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic clause including defence procurement minister Guto Bebb - who dramatically resigned at the door of the lobby. The Eurosceptic Conservative MPs’ amendment to stop the UK from joining the EU’s VAT regime, was also approved by a majority of three - 303 votes to 300. There were 11 Conservative rebels who voted against. but Mr Bebb was not one of them.  But the Customs Bill itself passed by 318 votes to 285 - majority 33.  It comes after Theresa May produced a plan at her Chequers country residence which would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels’ rules on goods and food which angered many of those who supported Leave. A number 10 source said ahead of the votes last night. “We have accepted the amendments because we believe its consistent with the approach that we set out.” Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “Theresa May has now lost all moral authority in order to scrape through tonight by three votes she sold out ot hard Tory right and tore up the White Paper she published only days ago.  “Craven cowardice not worth of a Prime Minister. We can’t go on like this.”   But Remain-supporting Labour MP Chuka Umunna praised Mr Bebb for quitting his government role, saying: “It’s good to see a minister putting his country before his party and his career.

But it was not so easy during the passage of the amendments to the crucial Brexit legislation.   The Government adopted four of the amendments which came from the hard Brexiteers headed up by Jacob Rees-Mogg .  Two of those were largely uncontroversial and passed \u0027on the nod\u0027 - with no need for a parliamentary vote. But the other two went to a vote - and passed by an incredibly narrow margin.  1) Stopping the UK collecting duties for the EU - unless Brussels agreed reciprocal arrangements The Eurosceptic Conservative MPs\u0027 new clause 36, to prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless the EU agrees to collect them for the UK, was approved by 305 votes to 302, majority three.  There were14 Tory rebels who voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic new clause 36 linked to tariffs. This included Defence minister Guto Bebb, a Remainer, who had to quit his front bench role in order to vote with the Remain rebels. They were: Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire), Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Richard Benyon (Newbury), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Nicky Morgan (Loughborough), Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst), Mark Pawsey (Rugby), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Anna Soubry (Broxtowe), and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes). Labour rebels  Three Labour MPs voted in favour of the Tory Eurosceptic new clause 36. They were Frank Field (Birkenhead), Kate Hoey (Vauxhall) and Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton).  2) Stopping the UK from joining the EU\u0027s VAT regime The Eurosceptic Conservative MPs\u0027 amendment 73, to stop the UK from joining the EU\u0027s VAT regime, was approved by 303 votes to 300 - majority three. Tory MPs  There were 11 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic amendment 73 linked to VAT. They were: Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire), Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Nicky Morgan (Loughborough), Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes).

But you\u0027ll need a lot more than protests to get rid of the obese orange loofah, who\u0027s just announced he will run for a second term. Because his time in office is not as limited as you might think.  The generally-accepted truth is that US presidents can serve only two terms of 4 years each. But this is not a rule. It\u0027s a convention, underpinned by the 22nd amendment to the US Constitution. And that amendment actually limits the time in office to a theoretical 10 years, if someone wanted to push it by replacing another president for 2 years less one day. And while you\u0027re struggling with the idea of a whole decade of Trump, consider this - an amendment can be amended.  Now, it\u0027s a tricky business. And if you\u0027re one of those who hates Trump and pays attention to history, you\u0027ll be about to zip down to the comments and talk about constitutional checks and balances, how it must get through Congress, he can\u0027t even get the wall paid for, Foxy you have taken leave et cetera. But if there\u0027s one thing the Republican Party has shown so far, it\u0027s that they are prepared to let Trump do almost what he pleases if it keeps them in power. Only a few have resigned on principle, only a few state publicly he\u0027s a fool, and by and large they have flown in his slipstream in return for undoing all those abortion laws, tax regulations and other things they dislike. The Democrats, meanwhile, are disorganised. There\u0027s no credible leader, no unifying message, no prospective opponent to dismantle Trump\u0027s edifice of bulls***.  Which means he heads into the November mid-terms in first place with every chance of more power in Congress. Every single House of Representatives seat is up for grabs, along with a third of the Senate - most of them Democrats.   Don\u0027t talk to me of your Russia investigation, or your federal and state probes into witness tampering or campaign funding or who did what when.  Not only has Trump managed to devalue them by doing even worse things in public - telling Canada to piss off, stepping on the Queen, trying to destroy NATO - they\u0027ll take years to grind through the US legal system.   Donald Trump lied or misled you at least 5 times in his interview with Piers Morgan  Already this year Trump\u0027s used the power of presidential pardon to free a former Republican aide who obstructed justice. Last year he pardoned a sheriff who rounded up migrants without any reasonable suspicion of a crime, and who had been convicted for contempt of court.  His aides have been discussing in public Trump\u0027s legal power even to pardon himself, and he\u0027s just about to make the Supreme Court an ultra-Conservative arbitrator of his actions. So if Russian collusion, or any other of the numerous crimes his team have been accused of, get as far as the Chief Oompah-Loompah there\u0027s no guarantee that the mud will stick.  US politics has a history of non-adhesive mud.  We\u0027re still looking at an absolute maximum of 10 years, right? Not necessarily. If he doesn\u0027t amend the amendment, he can find ways around it. There is precedent for the imposition of martial law, suspension of the US constitution and even getting the same result without actually having to do either, by asking Congress to approve it and them being terrified enough to do as requested.  Donald Trump says he intends to run for re-election in 2020 - and doesn\u0027t think ANYONE can beat him  Abraham Lincoln did it in 1861 at the outbreak the American Civil War. Congress approved of all his measures - including giving the military the power of arrest and summary trial - without any official declarations.  Dear old Donald only this week compared himself to Honest Abe, claiming he had better polling than the bearded abolitionist even though there was no such polling in his lifetime.  That\u0027s before we move on to the Founding Fathers, those men who led the War of Independence and framed the constitution so there could be no more tyranny. They were quite keen on the idea of a president-for-life and didn\u0027t want term limits in the first place.  So now we have a definite 4 years of Trump that looks likely to be 8, with a possible extension until 2026. You have a lack of credible opposition, and criminal investigations that won\u0027t bear fruit for a long time.  On top of that we have an obvious route for a PR campaign invoking the spirit of the Benjamin Franklin, George Washington and Abe Lincoln, and a constitution which states in Article 1, section 9: The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.  Now, is there any sort of invasion or rebellion Mr Trump might like to get people worried about?  Mexicans, protesters, Muslims, women, and immigrants of hues other than white all seem to exist in greater numbers, and more volume, than Mr Trump seems to like. You can see him typing the tweet, can\u0027t you?    All we have left to wonder is whether or not this man, who lied about his height in order to pretend he is not morbidly-obese and worries what you think of his tiny hands, is vain enough to WANT to stay in office forever.  Well, in 2016 while running for office he told a rally in Ohio: I’m just thinking to myself right now: we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for?  And in March, after meeting President Xi Jinping a month after a successful campaign to change the Chinese term-limit laws, Trump announced: He\u0027s now president for life. President for life. No, he\u0027s great. And look, he was able to do that. I think it\u0027s great. Maybe we\u0027ll have to give that a shot some day.  He was joking both times, of course. But then he was joking about Barack Obama\u0027s birth certificate, and joking about a wall, and joking about running for president - once. If you joke about something shocking, actually doing it then seems less bad.

The clash came as MPs debated the customs bill in which tensions were high between the opposing sides of the referendum debate. Ms Soubry was told by Tory former minister Sir Edward Leigh she ain\u0027t no Margaret Thatcher after she praised the former prime minister for her support of free trade. Ms Soubry told the Commons she had never pretended to be but reminded the Commons that Mrs Thatcher was one of the strongest proponents of the single market. Sir Edward\u0027s remarks prompted shouts of pathetic from some Tory backbenchers.  It was just one of a number of clashes between Tory backbenchers.  Former minister Anna Soubry urged Tory colleagues to have a reality check on Brexit and how the party is conducting itself.  She also said a group of 40 hard, no deal Brexiteers should be seen off by the Government. The stormy scenes in the Commons emerged after the Government said it would accept four amendments to the Bill, which allows the UK to establish a new customs regime and ensure VAT and excise laws operate as required upon Brexit, tabled by Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers. Ms Soubry was among those who said she could not support new clause 36 - which prevents the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless the EU agrees to collect them from the UK - and amendment 73, which stops the UK from joining the EU\u0027s VAT regime. Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve labelled the two amendments as unnecessary and useless, adding the only reason behind their tabling was malevolent.  Ms Soubry later said: This Government is in grave danger of not just losing the plot but losing a considerable amount of support from the people of this country unless we get Brexit right. Ms Soubry went on: Members on the frontbench and across this place should be shaking their heads with shame - this is the stuff of complete madness. And the only reason that the Government has accepted these amendments is because it is frightened of somewhere in the region of 40 Members of Parliament - the hard, no deal Brexiteers, who should have been seen off a long time ago and should be seen off.  These are people who do not want a responsible Brexit, they want their version of Brexit - they don\u0027t even represent the people who actually voted Leave. The consequences of this are grave, not just for our country but also for this party.

Republicans were filmed backing a spoof programme to teach pre-schoolers how to defend themselves with firearms as part of Sacha Baron Cohen \u0027s new show.   The British comedian\u0027s new seven-episode series, \u0027Who is America?\u0027, sees him adopt four different personas as he satirises the political and cultural life of the US in the Donald Trump era.  In the first episode, which airs tonight in the UK, the Ali G star poses as an Israeli anti-terror expert to gets two US congressmen to support for his fake \u0027Kinders\u0027 scheme for kids as young as three.  The scheme includes a fake instructional video featuring children\u0027s songs and \u0027gunimals\u0027 - weapons adorned with soft toys - that would purportedly help kids confront the school shootings that have plagued America for the past decade.  Republican congressmen Dana Rohrabacher of California and Joe Wilson of South Carolina, along with former Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, who is now a lobbyist at a Washington law firm, are shown enthusiastically backing the idea, alongside gun rights advocates and a former congressman-turned-talk radio host, Joe Walsh.  Showtime and Sacha Baron Cohen both declined to comment on the series. Those shown endorsing the fake scheme, including the politicians, had not seen the finished show ahead of its premiere in the US on Sunday. Rohrabacher, Wilson and Lott did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Walsh told CNN on Saturday that he was tricked into reading the words off a teleprompter.  The show marks Baron Cohen\u0027s first television project in a decade after he launched his comedy career as subversive white English rapper Ali G, whose interviewees included Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich. His 2006 faux documentary film \u0027Borat\u0027 ridiculed Kazakhstan and Middle Americans.  In \u0027Who is America?\u0027, Baron Cohen also takes aim at the media and political correctness, with the comedian posing as a pony-tailed liberal radio reporter on a post-2016 election cycling tour, and a man in a disability scooter who purports to investigate fake news. In the first episode, Baron Cohen\u0027s radio journalist persona is shown dining at the home of two Trump supporters in South Carolina and regaling them with lurid stories about his supposed family.

Members of the equality and diversity network at Bath University were warned using the sentence as you know might make people feel inadequate. There are also concerns it might make students feel they are unable to ask questions as they believe they should already know the answer.  The advice came after an anonymous student complained about the phrase being use, claiming it led to self-doubt, reports Mail Online .  However other people have slammed the idea.  Author and former university lecturer Joanna Williams said The assumption that students can\u0027t cope with the common expression as you know is ridiculous. She also said such ideas were being generated by people \u0027who need to justify their salaries\u0027.

Drew Povey and three other members of staff were suspended from Harrop Fold High School in Salford on Thursday after an internal investigation which has already lasted for several months. The reason behind the suspension has been revealed today - but Mr Povery has vowed to clear his name saying his suspension was unfair.  It is understood the issue is over ‘student coding’, the process by which pupils’ status and development is recorded - with some students records allegedly being enhanced, the Manchester Evening News reports .   Mr Povey reportedly raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for the school last year through a series of leadership talks for businesses - and through the sales of his book, Educating Drew. The book documents how he turned around the school once branded among the worst in the country. He was in demand as a speaker and author after becoming the charismatic star of Channel 4’s Educating Greater Manchester. Mr Povey said he has also worked with England manager Gareth Southgate for UK Sport, a government body to promote and fund elite sport. Some of the cash was used to reduce the school’s debt, which Mr Povey inherited when he took over as head.  The debt, to Salford council, was \u0026pound3million, but has been reduced to \u0026pound1.5million. More than 600 people have signed a petition calling for him to be reinstated at the school. An investigation, started several months ago, is currently being carried out by the school’s governors. Mr Povey and three colleagues were suspended last week. Plans for Channel 4 TV crews to return to the school in September will almost certainly by shelved.  The situation will also mean that Ofsted inspectors will return to the school to carry out an inspection. The school was graded ‘good’ in 2013. A stand in ‘head’ has been appointed, and the chair of governors, Anne Boyson, said in a letter to parents that the school was in ‘a very difficult situation’. Until the end of the term, Sue Johnson, who works for Salford council, has been made ‘interim leader.’ In the letter, Mrs Boyson, said: “We are following our school procedures as quickly as possible but we are unable at this current time to tell you how long this will take.

Instead Chris, alongside Lesley\u0027s family and friends, had planned the big day as a surprise and was waiting to marry her. Lesley, 35, said she thought she was going to spend the day as maid of honour for friend Tina Stewart.

Rachel Simon should be playing outside and enjoying the UK heatwave like other children on their summer break. But the bizarre condition means soaring temperatures leave her vomiting up to 30 times an hour. Most Brits have loved the run of glorious weather, with temperatures spiking at 32C. But as soon as the thermometer peaks, fed-up Rachel has to sit inside and watch her little sister Hannah play with a sick bucket at her side.  Rachel suffers from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (CVS), a rare and little understood condition that can be sparked by many things including stress, excitement and even the weather. Episodes can see Rachel vomiting for days alongside suffering crippling stomach pains. It means the 4ft schoolgirl\u0027s weight has dipped to under five stone and she has to eat 2,500 calories a day just to keep her weight up - the same amount as a fully-grown man. When she was born, doctors were baffled by her constant vomiting but assured her mum that she was just suffering from reflux.  But at the age of six, Rachel was eventually diagnosed with CVS and in order to control it, her parents Karen Young, 38, and Craig Simon, 40, have to limit activities which may spark it. Because the hot weather is a trigger, the family cannot enjoy the sunshine and have to stay inside. Trips to the beach aren\u0027t an option and the family are limited to holidays in the Lake District, where it is usually cool. At home, Rachel has to watch her sister Hannah, five, play in the garden while she sits in her bedroom.  If she becomes too hot, she will start to feel very sick and will vomit for hours, or even days, at a time. Mum Karen said: We have to keep her as cool as we can and out of the sun as much as we can. But she\u0027s a nine-year-old girl and doesn\u0027t want to be stuck indoors. We try to arrange things where we will be out of the sun such as mini-golf or the cinema. If we are going to be outside, we have to stop and take regular breaks. The severity and length of episodes can also be worse if she catches a cold, so winter is also a troubling time.  Because of that, Rachel has only celebrated Christmas normally twice. Cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare disorder most commonly seen in children, although it can affect adults too. Sufferers recover from the episode quickly and feel perfectly well, before experiencing another episode just weeks later These attacks are not explained by an infection or other illness. At its worst, Rachel suffered an episode that lasted nine agonising days and she was last admitted to hospital in June. Since 2010, she has suffered an average of two episodes a month, at a length of 24 hours to five days, missing between 25 and 33 days of a school a year.  During these episodes and afterwards, she suffers from exhaustion so chronic that her parents must carry her to the bathroom and hold her upright and she cannot be left on her own. Attempts at treating the condition with drugs have failed to help alleviate the symptoms. The condition is so rare the precise number of sufferers is unknown and many doctors don\u0027t even know it exists. When she is not struck by sickness, Rachel appears no different to any of her friends. The chatty nine-year-old loves running about and playing with pals.  And although her school attendance has dipped, amazingly she is still performing well academically. But everything has to be controlled so not to aggravate her CVS. Despite this, her parents say she is determined not to let it get the better of her. Karen said: Rachel has such a zest for life. She is such a great kid in the face of everything. The fact that her academic life is not struggling is a result of Rachel refusing to let this condition rule her. To ensure she does not overeat or undereat, which can trigger an episode, her parents must weigh her portions.

The pictures show the little royal surrounded by his closest family - including mum Kate, dad William, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Uncle Harry, Auntie Meghan and the Middleton gang. Kate and Wills asked British photographer Matt Holyoak to take the official christening snaps after being impressed by the photos he took of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on their 70th wedding anniversary. But after realising the first batch, the royal family decided to share a fifth photo - and it quickly became people\u0027s favourites. The adorable new snap wasn\u0027t part of the official collection, and was actually taken by a completely different photograher.  The sweet photo, which is more casual than the official pictures, shows the little prince being held by his mum Kate with a huge smile on his face. Matt Porteous was hired as the private photographer at Prince Louis\u0027 christening, and was asked to take snaps for the family\u0027s private album. However despite the photo being taken just for the family, Kate and Wills decided they wanted to share it with the world - and we\u0027re very glad they did! Matt, who is based in Jersey, also photographed Prince George for his third birthday last year.  Kate and Wills shared the photo via the Kensington Palace Twitter account with the caption: The Duke and Duchess hope that everyone enjoys this lovely photograph of Prince Louis as much as they do. Prince Louis was christened on July 9 at The Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace . The small service, attended only by Louis\u0027 closest family and new godparents, was led by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.  Prince George and Princess Charlotte were there on the big day, and it was the first time the Cambridges were seen as a family of five. After the short service the guests all headed back to Clarence House for a private tea, which included a christening cake made from a tier of Kate and Wills\u0027 wedding cake.

Elizabeth Lowe, 30, and husband James, 38, were married for five years before inviting Ashley Lowe and Audrie Lowe, both 22, into their marriage. The four of them - whose children are aged between one and eight - share a king-sized bed and have a rotation in bed so everyone gets a turn sleeping next to each other. Elizabeth said the relationship feels completely natural, but it has left her mum furious and led to them being shunned by their church.  But the mum, from Columbus, Ohio in the US, said she wouldn\u0027t change a thing about her love life, adding: My two wives, husband and I are happier than ever. We don\u0027t care what society thinks, because we love each other dearly. Elizabeth met James in a psychology class at Columbus State College in June 2008, and they quickly fell in love.  They married in June 2009 and, over the next five years, had six children together. But, despite their happy marriage, Elizabeth made a shocking confession to James in January 2014 telling him she wanted to bring a woman into their relationship. She said: James wasn\u0027t sure at first but, after two months, he grew to love the idea too.  In March 2014, Elizabeth met Audrie, from San Antonio, Texas, at her college cafeteria. Elizabeth, a bank worker, said: She was so lovely and pretty. I had an instant attraction to her. The next day, I introduced her to James at the cafeteria. The three of us started hanging out at the park with our kids.  Eventually I realised that I was in love with Audrie and, six months later, we confessed our feelings for each other. In August 2014, Audrie and I became intimate with each other. James was happy for us. Six months later, Audrie and James, who are both artists, fell in love while on a road trip alone in Texas. From that moment on, Ashley shared the couple\u0027s bed and the trio became polyamorous.  But they only lasted for a month as they met Ashley, also from San Antonio. Elizabeth said: Ashley and James became gym buddies. Within six months, James confessed he had feelings for Ashley. Both Audrie and I were on board, she was an amazing woman. It wasn\u0027t until we went on a family camping trip in February 2015 when Ashley told us she wanted to join our relationship.  We told her we loved her too. That day, we bought a king-sized bed so that we had plenty of space at night. We slept together for the first time. Being intimate with three other people felt completely natural. The quad soon labelled themselves as in a polyfidelity relationship where all members are considered equal partners and there\u0027s a mutual agreement to not allow any sexual activity with people outside of the group. Elizabeth said: Three months after we all got together, I called my mum and told her about Audrie and Ashley. She was furious.  She told me that the devil follows me wherever I go. It broke my heart. The four of us make love together, and we all love each other equally the same. We all have a rotation in bed which ensures everyone has a turn to sleep next to each other. Our sexual activity is relaxed in that we can be with anyone we choose at any time, within the quad.  The foursome enjoy date nights together at restaurants, but also split up depending on who feels like going out. Elizabeth said: We all hold hands and kiss when we go out. We do get funny looks sometimes, but we just laugh it off. A lot of people at our church have said that we are bad for the church and they don\u0027t agree with our lifestyle.

But even royals aren\u0027t immune from it either.  Spare a thought for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex , who recently had to field the one question most newlyweds/sane people dread while greeting fans in Dublin.  Luckily, a lifetime of having to make small talk with strangers and deal with a vast array of questions has its benefits when you\u0027re royal. Meaning Harry had the perfect response ready.  While on a walkabout, royal fan Elaine Adam-Stewart asked them:   My husband also has red hair and he gave me five children - when are you and Meghan going to get going? Of course, saying mind your own business is out of the question when you\u0027re royal.  But despite only having been married two months, Harry seemed to not take any offence, as Elaine later told People : He laughed and said: \u0027Five children? Too many.\u0027   Well played, Harry. For those eager for a royal baby, 2018 has been a good year. On April 23 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed Prince Louis into their family. He was joined by another little royal playmate last month, as Zara and Mike Tindall became parents to baby Lena Elizabeth.  As for Meghan and Harry, the couple have been open about their desire for start a family. Following their engagement back in November, they were interviewed by the BBC, and the question about kids arose then You know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future, Harry answered diplomatically.

It might be a tiny little pug or a playful Labrador, but there is something about them which just makes us want to go over and say hello. And for many people the automatic reaction is to give the dog a pat on the head - but it turns out this is actually very rude in dog language.  Sarah Bartlett , qualified international dog training instructor, has shed some light on why you shouldn\u0027t pat a head on the dog.   With a little help from her miniature dachshund Moss (which you can watch in full in the video above), she explains: The wrong way to approach a dog is to walk up to them head on and just lean straight over them and go down and [stroke them]. That for a dog is quite threatening. Mos says I\u0027m not quite sure about this, his head goes quite low.   Dogs don\u0027t like you going over their head. It\u0027s quite a threatening gesture for them, as is going straight forward into them.   But don\u0027t worry, she\u0027s not telling you to avoid those lovely doggies and has explained what to do instead.  Sarah, who runs Hound Helpers Ltd , says: The best thing is to approach them from the side and then go down.  Keep your own bubble and their bubble, and it\u0027s then the dog\u0027s choice whether then encroach into your bubble. I\u0027m crouched down sideways and all I\u0027m going to do is offer my hand out. If the dog sniffs your hand, you should then give them a little scratch under the chin or the ear.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

An employment tribunal awarded him more than £10,000.But now Mr Brown, who runs events and production company The Longest Forty, is taking the club and American director Mr Nelms to a tribunal again – this time citing post-employment victimisation and harassment.The action stems from a dispute over a Legends of the Ball – Champions 2013/2014 event which was due to take place at the Doubletree by Hilton on the outskirts of the city in February.It is understood that Mr Brown alleges that Dens Park chief Mr Nelms contacted Hilton boss Richard Ellison and forced him to cancel the event – leading to a breach of contract – and said he was unhappy someone who was successful in a claim against the club was working alongside the hotel.He also alleges Mr Nelms prevented current Dundee players Craig Wighton and Cammy Kerr from attending the event, despite them having already agreed to do so and having been advertised as appearing.The event was cancelled and Mr Brown alleges this was due to his previous case against Dundee.He now wants damages and alleges that Mr Nelms’ actions were maliciously motivated.It is understood both the club amd Mr Nelms dispute Mr Brown’s claims and insist he did not intervene and that official permission was never sought for players to attend the event.Dundee FC and representatives for Mr Nelms declined to comment.Solicitor Ryan Russell, of Muir Myles and Laverty, confirmed he had been instructed to pursue a claim on Mr Brown’s behalf.He said: “Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, it would inappropriate to comment at this stage on the specifics or merits of the claim. There will be no comment until the conclusion of the case.”The case called at an employment tribunal on Friday for a preliminary hearing.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8053922.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"15-stunning-photographs-of-the-glasgow-forth-and-clyde-canal","story":"                          Once\u0026nbspthe main driver for economic development, canals in Scotland are now primarily a backdrop to days out, fishing trips and watersports.

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass. They are loving it and enjoying the peace and quiet.\"Others have used it as a thoroughfare as part of their daily commute while the Northern Constabulary Pipe Band also took the opportunity to hold its rehearsals in the park one evening.The idea of a community buyout is being driven by the Northern Counties Cricket Club, one of the park\u0027s main users.Mr Ford, who is a club member, believes such a move will be good for the club, the community and Inverness \u0026ndash and the buildings which are deteriorating.\"Without investing time and money, they could be mothballed and if that happens, we would not be able to use the park,\" he said.\"To me, a community buyout is common sense.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen museum to open doors to kids with additional needs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen museum is to host its first relaxed opening for children with additional support needs.The Gordon Highlanders Museum will open its doors to visitors with extra needs, their families and carers on Monday July 23.The event is part of a summer partnership with the charity Me Too.Gordon Highlanders Museum curator Ruth Duncan said: “As a lively museum with lots going on, we know that sometimes this can be challenging for visitors with additional support needs.“We are committed to removing barriers to accessing the museum and hope we can encourage more visitors who perhaps wouldn’t normally consider coming to the museum to pop in.”Learning officer at the museum Lewis Gibbon said: “We are thrilled to be working in partnership with Me Too on our first relaxed day.“I hope this is a stepping stone for more collaborations with this fantastic charity.”Visitors will be able to explore the display areas in a calm, relaxed atmosphere, take part in some additional craft activities and check out some of the museum’s handling collection.Me Too chief executive Phionna McInnes said she was happy the museum would be more accessible.She said: “I am delighted to be working in partnership with Gordon Highlanders Museum and their commitment to make their facilities accessible to people with additional support needs who may struggle to access the facilities due to sensory considerations or understanding from others.“This not only gives an opportunity to local participants but also gives a clear message to tourists that the museum is making an effort to be accessible to a wider community.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b48aaf9adf64-442x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could you give a forever home to any of these animals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

On a lovely summer evening the rafters of Strachur Memorial Hall dirled to the sound of pipers showing off skills learned during the week in front of proud family members. John Kelly of Dunoon performed his master of ceremony duties with his usual wit and dexterity.An award, presented by his family in memory of the late Niall Campbell, is presented each year to the pupil who has shown the biggest improvement in the eyes of the tutors.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival. This weekend is about celebrating the heart of Tarbert and we’re delighted so many people came to join us.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rogue-roofers-con-borders-pensioner-out-of-four-figure-sum","story":"ROGUE roofers have conned a Borders pensioner out of a four-figure sum of money.\nAn incident took place in Kelso on Thursday, July 5 when two men attended the property, offering to carry out temporary roof repairs.\nThe resident, a man in his eighties, was convinced to pay the sum in cash for some very minor work.\nOne man is described as white, aged between 40 to 45, tall, medium build, black hair past his ears, with an English accent, wearing a black leather jacket, white t-shirt and black shorts.\nThe other man is described as white, also aged between 40 to 45, brown neck length hair, tall, broader build, with a Scottish accent, wearing a white t-shirt and brown shorts.\nThe men are believed to have been travelling in a plain white van.\nPolice Scotland have launched an investigation into the incident.\nA spokesperson said: \"We often see an increase in bogus caller incidents at this time of year, with bogus callers offering to carry out property repairs or garden maintenance.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

Campbeltown Town Councillors found themselves asking this time and again during a long debate on council housing for key workers at their monthly meeting on Monday evening.Bailie George McMillan had put forward a motion \u0026#8216that this council decide that all applications for a let of a council house should be accompanied by a certificate from the Ministry of Labour, in consultation with the Board of Trade.\u0026#8217Bailie McMillan said that some workers classified as key workers had been allocated houses under a \u0026#8216great stretch of imagination.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Stick by the rules,\u0026#8217 added the bailie, \u0026#8216and let the application lie for 30 days for investigations.\u0026#8217Seconding Bailie McMillan, Councillor Charles Kennedy said that nobody classed as a key worker had been allocated a house under his convenership of the housing committee.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSaturday July 13, 1918If the success of the fishermen’s concert held in the Victoria Hall on the evening of Saturday last is to be taken as criterion \u0026#8211 and we think this is the manner in which it should be regarded – the local effort in connection with Scotland’s present July movement on behalf of the Red Cross funds bids fair to establish another record for whole-souled generosity on the part of the community of the town and district.Excellently organised by the joint secretaries, Messrs A. Ollar and D. Robertson, who had the energetic assistance of a most representative and capable committee of boat-owners and band of other devoted workers, the appeal made to the public for a full measure of that liberal support for which this locality has earned a name which is second to none struck a most responsive chord, with the result that the large hall was crowded to the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kitchen firm cooks up charity cash","story":"Recently Raymond Harvey of the Campbeltown Christmas lights group on left and Lewis MacKay from Castlehill primary football collected cheques from Howden\u0026#8217s manager Archie Martin centre. 25_c28howdens01_RaymondHarvey_ArchieMartin_LewisMackay\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"simple pleasures of working outside in good weather","story":"NFU president Andrew McCornick said: \u0026#8216This year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year’s difficult harvest.\u0026#8216The recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members.\u0026#8216After suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather they have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.\u0026#8216The quality of winter fodder made to date is likely to be tremendous.\u0026#8216I am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity.\u0026#8216That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":null,"title":"mixed-reaction-for-retail-plans-at-ex-sainsburys-site","story":"  A retail development with four units and a \u0026lsquodrive-thru\u0026rsquo coffee shop are proposed at the site to the west of the town, close to the Oak Tree Junction of the A1.  The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier.

East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

The internet giant said its offering will make it easier to find jobs as it gathers openings from existing recruitment agencies into one place directly from its search engine.  Positions will be ranked on relevance and quality, using spam detection software to filter out any fraudulent job postings.  Those who have a Gmail account can also choose to receive an email alert whenever a new job match comes up, or they can tap a button to keep track of an individual job post.  Google is working with a number of established players including  Jobs, Reed, The , CV Library and totallylegal that will take users directly to the application page.  Users can also access salary information, reviews and employer ratings.  Reed\u0026rsquos director of marketing Mark Rhodes said: \u0026ldquoEarly signs from our testing with Google show jobseekers arriving at reed via this new search experience are application-ready, with a high level of intent, so we anticipate seeing a positive impact on the quality and volume of applications we supply to our recruitment clients.  The feature, Google\u0026rsquos latest move to centralise services within its popular search engine, will rival existing job vacancy aggregators such as Indeed.  Indeed\u0026rsquos UK managing director Bill Richards said: \u0026ldquoIndeed\u0026rsquos sole mission is to help people get jobs.  \u0026ldquoTo that end, we\u0026rsquore focused on bringing the best opportunities to jobseekers and the very best candidates to UK companies.  \u0026ldquoIndeed is confident that it will continue to be successful no matter who enters this space.  Google first introduced job searches in the US last year, before embarking on a wider launch which took in countries including India and South Africa.  The company says it has seen an increase in the number of companies showing jobs in its search engine and has already connected tens of millions of people around the world to new job opportunities.  In November, Google pledged to help thousands of people improve their digital skills by opening a Digital Garage in Manchester.  The scheme provides anyone with free face-to-face expert coaching and courses, in a bid to help 100,000 people in the UK find a job.  Employment increased by 146,000 in the quarter to April to 32.39 million, the highest figure since records began in 1971, giving a record rate of 75.6%.

Further challenges lay ahead as pro-EU Tory amendments to the Trade Bill go before MPs on Tuesday.  Late on Monday, Mrs May saw off defeat by just three votes on two key changes to the customs bill after a Remainer backlash in the warring party.  Defence minister Guto Bebb voted against the Government, effectively quitting his frontbench role.  He is the tenth in a series of MPs, ranging from star names to minor players, to have quit since the Chequers\u0026rsquo agreement on Brexit, though the first Remainer to go.  Mrs May had earlier bowed to Brexiteer demands to stem a threatened uprising on the bill.  But the string of concessions infuriated Conservative Remainers who refused to back the amendments to the legislation.  Some 14 Tory rebels voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic clause that would prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless it agreed to do the same.  An amendment that would stop the UK from joining the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime saw\u0026nbsp11 Conservative rebels.  Mrs May inched through with the support of three Labour MPs,\u0026nbspFrank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, on both.  In bruising Commons exchanges, Remainer Anna Soubry accused Mrs May of \u0026ldquocaving in to Eurosceptics.  The Tory former minister told the Commons: \u0026ldquoNobody voted Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them.  But as tempers flared, Ms Soubry was told she \u0026ldquoain\u0026rsquot no Margaret Thatcher by Sir Edward Leigh when she invoked the late premier\u0026rsquos support for free trade.  Amid the turmoil, the Government tabled a motion calling for the current parliamentary session to be cut short.  MPs will vote on whether to start their summer recess on Thursday instead of next Tuesday.          Brilliant speech from @Anna_Soubry in the Customs Bill debate \u0026ndash the Chequers White Paper is a good move by the PM for a sensible Brexit \u0026amp Government should have no time for ERG wrecking Amendments          \u0026mdash Nicky Morgan MP (@NickyMorgan01) July 16, 2018  The move is likely to outrage many members of the public concerned about the divisions over Brexit and the ticking clock counting down to exit day.  But an early holiday would stymie Tory MPs plotting against the increasingly politically fragile premier.  Mrs May told MPs the Brexiteer amendments she accepted did not change her Chequers blueprint for Brexit.  But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the PM of \u0026ldquocapitulating and said the Chequers deal was now \u0026ldquodead in the water.  Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: \u0026ldquoToday we have seen the truly calamitous state of the Tory party, as once again the Prime Minister is forced to concede ground to hold together her unholy alliance of MPs."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8067002.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-nine-hidden-gems-in-argyll-and-bute","story":"  Paddle Steamer Waverley  Join Waverley this summer for a magical journey.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

The Twin Pioneer had its wings removed in order to be transported to Mains Farm in Thornhill where it will be reassembled by Mr Steedman before a kitchen and bathroom is fitted inside.    He said: \"G-APRS, or Primrose as she is affectionately known by those who flew her, was one of the last flying Twin Pioneers in the world.  \"She faithfully served on civilian and military missions for nearly 50 years, before being retired because of her ageing wing struts. We\u0027re delighted to be bringing her back home to Scotland where we\u0027ll convert her into a first-class glamping experience.  \"We\u0027re sure that like our Sea King she\u0027ll attracts tourists and aviation enthusiasts alike, which is great news for the rural economy and local jobs.\"  Designed and built in Prestwick, Twin Pioneers were said to be Scotland\u0027s most successful and recognisable aircraft of the era used for civilian and military duties.  Their unique high wing design meant they were able to take off and land within small areas.  The aircraft still has 14 passenger seats inside which will be replaced by a bedroom but its cockpit will remain for visitors to check out.  Mr Steedman said: \"We\u0027ll be drawing on our experience of converting the helicopter and preserving as much of the interior as possible for future generations to enjoy, including the stunning two-seater cockpit.  \"Primrose will turn 60 next year, so we\u0027re hoping to get her into tip top shape for her big birthday.  \"We\u0027d love to track down the team who built her and involve them in her transformation.\"  VisitScotland regional director Neil Christison has praised the unique camping site.

They have lived in Glasgow since their family fled Pakistan in 2012 after their father was subjected to death threats due to his Christian faith.  The UK Government has repeatedly rejected the family\u0026rsquos asylum applications, largely because officials do not believe they would be at risk in Pakistan.  The family have been told they have exhausted the process and have no right to appeal but are prepared to launch a legal challenge.  The Right Reverend Susan Brown, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, supports the boys\u0026rsquo case. She said: \u0026ldquoTens of thousands of people want their names to count in the campaign to allow the Bakhsh family to stay in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis is a family who call this country home and the uncertainty they are living with is cruel.  \u0026ldquoScotland used to be a place renowned for its welcome. We need to make sure that reputation is preserved, especially when it comes to those who have nowhere else to turn to.  The boys\u0026rsquo father, Masqood, believes the people responsible for shooting dead two Christians outside a court in Faisalabad, Pakistan, know who he is and would kill him and his family given the chance.  He said they believe he is in league with the two men who were shot after being accused of writing a pamphlet critical of the Prophet Muhammad that flouted Pakistan\u0026rsquos controversial blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty.

Officials want to use the rugged backdrop for scenes in The Long Night, set 10,000 years before the original fantasy series.  They visited Skye to seek out beauty spots that would be ideal for use as action and scenery.  Earlier this month, it was announced that work on the spin-off will begin in Belfast\u0027s Titanic Quarter Film Studios in October, the same venue used to shoot many of the indoor scenes for Game Of Thrones over its eight series, while outdoor locations around Northern Ireland have also featured.  Fans of the must-see TV drama have already created online maps featuring every location used for Game of thrones, including Doune Castle which was used for the pilot episode. Scenes have been shot around the world, including in Iceland, Malta and Croatia and all countries have benefited from a rise in tourist numbers thanks to the programme\u0027s global following.  A record 2.1million overseas tourists visited Northern Ireland in 2016, upping revenue from this sector by 12 per cent, according to Tourism Ireland figures.  Belfast Airport also had the highest passenger increase of any destination, with 388,486 more customers in 2016 than the previous year.  HBO have green-lit five prequel series and commissioned a pilot episode.  A source said: \"This would be a massive development for Skye. Game Of Thrones had a huge impact on tourist numbers wherever it was filmed. The same will most likely apply to the prequel. Skye is definitely a potential venue for the The Long Night.  \"The show is set 10,000 years before Game Of Thrones so the makers need new ideas and locations. Skye ticks a lot of boxes for them.\"  Filming of the eighth and final series of Game Of Thrones finished earlier this month in Northern Ireland.  Most of the show has been filmed there since 2010.  The scenery of Skye has proved increasingly popular for movie and TV producers in recent years, with films shot there including 2008\u0027s Made of Honour, featuring Kevin McKidd and Patrick Dempsey the Alien sequel Prometheus in 2012, Macbeth with Michael Fassbender in 2015 and Roald Dahl\u0027s The BFG in 2016.  Blockbusters Transformers: The Last Knight and King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword both shot there last year.  The prequel series is being created by Game Of Thrones author George RR Martin.  Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager at VisitScotland, said: \"Film tourism in general is booming in Scotland in recent years with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Avengers: Infinity War on the big screen and Outlander continuing to prove its popularity on the small screen.  \"VisitScotland work closely with Scotland\u0027s film location offices as productions shot here not only boost the local economy during filming but also provide a shop window for the country\u0027s amazing landscapes and can have long-lasting effects for tourism.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scots-author-quintin-jardine-labels-ian-poulter-an-ahole-after-exchange-during-scottish-open","story":"  Jardine, who is also a member at the host course of Gullane, was marshalling in Saturday\u0027s third round when Poulter hit a wayward drive on the opening hole.

The study found that the number of family carers in Britain \u0026ndash 7.6 million \u0026ndash had risen by a million over the course of a decade, while the proportion of those providing 20 or more hours of help a week had increased by 4% between 2005 and 2015.  Age UK, which sponsored the research, warned more support was needed for so-called informal carers, and urged the Government to direct more funding to the care system.  Charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \u0026ldquoThe informal carers we meet at Age UK are usually deeply committed but they also often tell us that they are completely exhausted. Not only do they need more opportunities to take a break, they also require the back up of a reliable, effective social care system.  \u0026ldquoWhen informal carers are trying to cope all on their own, this is a recipe for burn out and the collapse of an arrangement which could otherwise work really well for an older person.  \u0026ldquoIt would be dangerously complacent for policymakers to assume there is an infinite supply of wonderful people able and willing to provide informal care for their loved ones. For all kinds of demographic, social and economic reasons our current system of social care is living on borrowed time \u0026ndash it urgently needs transforming and in 2018 we must make a serious start.  The report, which comes as the Government prepares to publish its green paper on social care, said family carers provided 149 million hours of care each week \u0026ndash equal to the work of four million full-time paid care-givers.  More than half (59%) of those caring for an elderly relative are women, while 19% of women in professional jobs provide care \u0026ndash up from 18% in 2005, the study added.  Caring can also have an impact on earnings, the report said, as people are more likely to work less than those without caring responsibilities.  Kathryn Petrie, Social Market Foundation economist, said: \u0026ldquoMore women with professional and managerial jobs are trying to combine work with family care.  \u0026ldquoWe know that carers are often driven to reduce their hours or leave work altogether and, without proper support for these carers, there is a risk that women are increasingly driven out of professional careers, reversing recent progress towards equality in the workforce.  The Department of Health and Social Care said its forthcoming social care green paper would look at long-term sustainable solutions for the social care system."},{"url":null,"title":"laughing-louis-pictured-with-kate-to-mark-christening","story":"  The baby prince is pictured alert and with a wide open-mouth smile as he is held upright in Kate\u0026rsquos arms.

The amendments could be used as a show of strength by the Brexiteers, who are furious at the Chequers plan, but there were signs at Westminster that Mrs May could be prepared to compromise in an effort to avert a damaging blow to her authority.  A senior Government source said \u0026ldquono decision yet had been made on whether to accept the amendments supported by arch-Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Bernard Jenkin, Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith.  A Brexiteer source said that while ministers \u0026ldquohaven\u0026rsquot yet accepted the amendments \u0026ldquoall the noise is in that direction.  Business Secretary Mr Clark was challenged about the potential revolt on the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, often referred to as the customs bill.  On BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme he urged Tory colleagues who \u0026ldquowant to get on with Brexit to acknowledge that the Bill was \u0026ldquoessential and should not be impeded.  Asked if there was a suggestion that ministers would accept the amendments he said: \u0026ldquoNo. The Bill is an important part of preparing for the world after Brexit and I would have thought that all colleagues would respect the fact that we need to get those preparations in place whilst having this important negotiation to make sure that our trading arrangement can continue to support prosperity in the future.  Sir Bernard told the programme that the Chequers plan was \u0026ldquodead, with opposition from both wings of the Tory party.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable.  Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), played down suggestions over the weekend they were seeking to topple Mrs May, saying she still had time to change course on her proposals.  However, the danger to the Prime Minister was underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers had set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, who quit over the Chequers plan.  The Daily  reported more than 100 MPs had joined the group, more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in the Prime Minister to force a leadership contest.  North Cornwall MP Scott Mann quit as a ministerial aide to the Treasury, the former postman saying he would not \u0026ldquodeliver a watered down Brexit.  The threat from the Brexiteers is not the only danger facing Mrs May, with pro-EU Tories tabling amendments of their own to the customs bill and the Trade Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday, which would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.  It was unclear whether they will actually press them to a vote after some pro-EU MPs backed Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan and EU white paper.  However, in a sign of just how volatile the party has become, former education secretary Justine Greening, who backed Remain, denounced the plan, saying it offered the \u0026ldquoworst of both worlds and called for a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people, she said in an article for The Times.  Meanwhile Boris Johnson, in his first public intervention since his resignation last week, appealed for people to take a more positive view of Britain\u0026rsquos prospects outside the EU.  In a sign that he was keeping his powder dry, he said in an article for The Daily  that he would resist \u0026ldquofor now the temptation \u0026ldquoto bang on about Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt is time for all of us, at this critical moment in our constitutional development, to believe in ourselves, to believe in the British people and what they can do, and in our democracy, he wrote.  \u0026ldquoPeople around the world believe passionately in Britain. It\u0026rsquos time we shared their confidence."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-adds-momentum-to-potential-uk-wide-bid-for-2030-world-cup","story":"  At the weekend, Tom Watson, Labour\u0026rsquos deputy leader, announced his party\u0027s support for an \u0026ldquoEngland-led bid for the 2030 event.  \u0026ldquoWhere better to celebrate the centenary of the World Cup than in the nation where football was born,\" he said.  Theresa May\u0026rsquos spokesman made clear ministers would be \u0026ldquohappy to sit down with football authorities across the four home nations and discuss a UK-wide proposal to host the sporting event in 12 years\u0026rsquo time.  \"We have a superb track record for putting on major sporting events and we have the stadiums, infrastructure and experience to deliver should a bid be successful,\" insisted the spokesman.  Asked whether or not the Government would favour a UK-wide bid over one by England alone, he replied: \"We would wait for them to come forward with proposals and look at those in the context of our track record, UK-wide, of delivering these sorts of events.  He then added: \"The UK as a whole has an excellent record in putting on sporting events.\"  It is not yet known whether or not, if a joint UK-wide bid were successful, all four home nations would automatically qualify as hosts.  FIFA is still to decide whether the US, Mexico and Canada, which have won a joint bid to stage the 2026 tournament, will all be given automatic qualification as is customary for the host or hosts.  In 2002, Japan and South Korea, which were joint hosts, received automatic entry. However, the footballing authorities might baulk at the prospect of four teams automatically qualifying. Yet from 2026, 48 teams rather than 32 will be enrolled in the competition.  Gianni Infantino, Fifa\u0026rsquos President, has already backed the idea of joint bids for the 2030 competition, saying: \u0026ldquoFor 2030 we have received this bid from three countries in Latin America[Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay]. I believe in joint bids because the World Cup is an enormous event.  \"We must not create white elephant stadiums in the desert that won\u0026rsquot be used after the World Cup. It is good to have joint bids and for two or three countries to organise the tournament, he said.  The North African trio of Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria is also set to bid for 2026.  Last month, Aleksander Ceferin, the President of Uefa, supported the idea of a bid by the UK\u0026rsquos four nations. \u0026ldquoEngland alone would have a strong bid but that bid would be even stronger if more countries were involved, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"french-world-cup-winners-receive-rapturous-welcome-home","story":"  Goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris, brandishing the golden trophy, and coach Didier Deschamps led the team from the Air France plane to the tarmac at Charles de Gaulle Airport.  Airport personnel and French sports minister Laura Flessel, a former champion fencer, were the first to tell them \"merci\" on behalf of a grateful nation sorely in need of a boost.  \"Eternal Happiness\" read Monday\u0027s headline in French sports daily L\u0027Equipe, summing up the mood of many who hope the euphoria will last for months - even years.  The team is expected to take a victory lap down the grand Champs-Elysees, the grand Paris avenue where hundreds of thousands thronged after France\u0027s 4-2 victory on Sunday night over Croatia to capture the trophy for the second time.  For a third day in a row, the avenue was transformed into a boulevard of pride and happiness following a Bastille Day parade of French military might on Saturday that, in hindsight, was a preview for the elation of France\u0027s World Cup win.  The team\u0027s appearance on the Champs-Elysees will be followed by a reception at the presidential palace.  Hundreds of guests, including people from soccer clubs connected to the French players, were invited. A club in the poor suburb where 19-year-old star player Kylian Mbappe grew up is among them.  The Etoile station is, for now, \"On a 2 Etoiles\" (We have 2 stars), to denote France\u0027s second World Cup, 20 years after Zinedine Zidane and Deschamps himself led Les Bleus to a 3-0 win over Brazil on home soil.  The Victor Hugo station is now Victor Hugo Lloris, after France\u0027s goalie and team captain.  Celebrations were spread across the nation, and among the still-dazed French players themselves.  \"We are linked for life now with this cup,\" defender Raphael Varane told BFM-TV on Monday before departing from Moscow.  French president Emmanuel Macron exulted on the field in Moscow and in the locker room, hugging players as they received their medals even as the skies poured rain on the pitch at Moscow\u0027s Luzhniki Stadium. Mr Macron clearly hoped the World Cup glow would give him a boost in a nation where his economic reforms have drawn fierce protests.  It was the players, though, who captured the French imagination. The mostly youthful, diverse team represents a generation with which traditionalists have yet to come to terms.  Despite the general euphoria, celebrations in France typically end up with a spate of violence by troublemakers, and Sunday was no exception.  Broken shop windows, pillage and other destruction lined a section of the Champs-Elysees, the postgame site for revelers. Riot police used water cannon and tear gas to end the violence.  French media reported that authorities detained 90 people for questioning in the Paris region and some 290 around France."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6925995.jpg?type=article-full","title":"andy-murray-now-23rd-best-tennis-playerin-britain","story":"  The former world number one has dropped to 839 in the world rankings following\u0026nbspinjury problems.

Such was the anger of some pro-EU Conservatives at Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocave-in to the Brexiteers that one, Guto Bebb, the Defence Minister, resigned so that he could oppose the Government. He becomes the 10th minister to resign over Brexit.  In other votes, Labour\u0027s new clause 11, which aimed to establish securing a customs union with the EU as a negotiating objective, was defeated by 316 votes to 289, a majority of 27, and the SNP\u0027s new clause 16, requiring the Scottish Parliament\u0027s consent to implement several powers in the Bill, was defeated by 316 votes to 36, a majority of 280.  Eurosceptic Conservatives had earlier proposed four changes to the UK Government\u0027s Customs Bill aimed at imposing strict conditions on Mrs May after she produced a plan at Chequers that would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels\u0027 rules on goods and food.  Just hours before MPs were due to vote on the amendments to the Taxation[Cross Border Trade] Bill, proposed by the European Research Group[ERG] led by ardent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, No 10 announced it would not be opposing them, claiming they were \u0026ldquoconsistent with the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint.  Three of the changes - to maintain the Union and not allow a customs border down the Irish Sea, to take the UK out of the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime and to guarantee there would be no new customs union with the EU without primary legislation at Westminster \u0026ndash seemed to roughly align with the Chequers compromise.  But the fourth - a refusal to collect tariffs on behalf of another country without reciprocity across the continent so that the EU would collect duties on behalf of the UK \u0026ndash did not not least because the EU27 would not agree to giving Britain preferential treatment.  However, No 10 pointed out a section of the White Paper to justify its argument of consistency.  It reads: \u0026ldquoThe UK proposes a tariff revenue formula, taking account of goods destined for the UK entering via the EU and goods destined for the EU entering via the UK.  This, a Downing Street spokesman, made clear the idea of reciprocity was hard-wired into the Chequers Plan.  Yet the paragraph goes on to say: \u0026ldquoHowever, the UK is not proposing that the EU applies the UK\u0026rsquos tariffs and trade policy at its border for goods intended for the UK.  During Commons exchanges, Mrs May - in response to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock\u0026rsquos claim that she had \u0026ldquocapitulated to the Tory hard Right - was adamant the Brexiteer amendments did not change her Brexit blueprint.  \"He is absolutely wrong\u0026hellipI would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these Bills. They do not change that Chequers agreement, she declared.  But not everyone was convinced. Her Tory colleague Anna Soubry, a leading Remainer, told MPs it seemed Mr Rees-Mogg was now \u0026ldquorunning Britain.  In contrast, Priti Patel, the former International Development Secretary and a prominent Leaver, who tabled the amendment calling for reciprocal action on collecting tariffs, said the PM\u0026rsquos move was \"constructive\".  Her Brexiteer colleague Peter Bone denounced the Chequers Plan as an \u0026ldquoabsolute shambles and called on his party leader to take it off the table.  Kirsty Blackman for the SNP accused the PM of being \u0026ldquoheld hostage by the Tory Brexiteers and suggested the Conservative Government was riding roughshod over Holyrood\u0026rsquos voice on EU withdrawal.  The Aberdeen MP said while businesses were desperate for clarity over endless Tory confusion, \u0026ldquowe get only in-fighting and a prime minister, who caves in to her extreme hard Brexit wing.  Outside the chamber, one Brexiteer source boasted how Mrs May\u0027s move on the Customs Bill had confirmed \"Chequers is dead on arrival\".  Earlier, the PM faced a call from leading Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, to facilitate a second EU referendum given the parliamentary \u0026ldquodeadlock but No 10 made clear the Government would not agree to such a move \u0026ldquounder any circumstances.  The powerplay over the Customs Bill is just one of several potential flashpoints this week.  After the votes on the Customs Bill, MPs will on Tuesday debate the Trade Bill and the issue of whether Britain should remain in the European single market.  On Wednesday, following the last PMQs of the parliamentary session, MPs will debate Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU and Mrs May will later appear before the Commons Liaison Committee made up of Committee Chairmen.  It is thought David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, will sometime this week make personal resignation statements in the Commons, which will pile more pressure on the PM.  The danger to Mrs May has been underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers have set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by Steve Baker, who last week quit his job as Brexit Minister over the Chequers plan.  It has been suggested more than 100 MPs have joined the group, a number which is more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in Mrs May to trigger a leadership contest.  Meanwhile earlier in the day,\u0026nbspScott Mann, the Cornwall MP, became the ninth person to quit their post in protest at the Chequers Plan. The ex-ministerial aide to the Treasury and a former postman, said he would not \"deliver a watered-down Brexit\"."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire economy buzzing with activity","story":"        A range of local business developments which demonstrate the strengths of the area\u0026#8217s economy have been welcomed by Aberdeenshire Council, as a new economic action plan for the area is introduced to reflect a more positive economic outlook.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Water levels as low as 1976 on River Thurso","story":"WATER levels on the River Thurso have been at their lowest in decades during the recent dry spell, according river expert Eddie McCarthy.Mr McCarthy, who retired as river superintendent in 2016, has manned the river for 37 years and says that the dry weather of the past few weeks has resulted in water levels comparable to those in the 1976 heatwave.Levels in 1984 were similarly low.One or two anglers have travelled up for pre-booked fishing trips only to change their plans after seeing the low water.However, overall this has had minimal impact on the river angling business, according Mr McCarthy.\u0026ldquoThe anglers are usually quite hardy, he said. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquoll take their golf clubs up or will go trout fishing.Despite the rain returning on Monday, Mr McCarthy is unsure when the water levels will return to normal. \u0026ldquoWe need 72 hours of proper rain for it to rise.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 16, 2018 at 1:18 pmWith strikes at Aberdeen Airport set to cause widespread travel disruption in the coming weeks, Orkney MSP Liam McArthur has called for compromise when it comes to NHS patients traveling south for treatment.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

We had quite a lot of bad weather just after we started in January, and then we had to wait for the big spring tides so we could carry out a lot of the work.\"The jetty was in fairly poor shape as it had been there for more than 100 years and had spent the entire time being battered by the sea.\"We made the jetty wider and also lengthened it.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768723.1531508582!/image/image.jpg","title":"benjamin sachs eight ethical questions about exploring outer space","story":"        Metallic shrapnel flying faster than bullets the Space Shuttle smashed to pieces astronauts killed or ejected into space.                The culprit? Space debris – remnants of a Russian satellite blown up by a Russian missile. The one survivor, Ryan Stone, has to find her way back to Earth with oxygen supplies failing and the nearest viable spacecraft hundreds of miles away. Over on Mars, 20 years in the future, an exploration mission from Earth is going wrong. An epic dust storm forces the crew to abandon the planet, leaving behind an astronaut, Mark Watney, who is presumed dead. He has to figure out how to grow food while awaiting rescue.            Hollywood knows how to terrify and inspire us about outer space. Movies like Gravity (2013) and The Martian (2015), present space as hostile and unpredictable – spelling danger for any intrepid human who dares to venture outside Earth’s hospitable confines.            This is only part of the story, however – the bit with people centre stage. Sure, no one wants to see astronauts killed or stranded in space. And we all want to enjoy the fruits of successful planetary science, like determining which planets could host human life or simply whether we’re alone in the universe.But should we care about the universe beyond how it affects us as humans? That is the big question – call it question #1 of extraterrestrial environmental ethics, a field too many people have ignored for too long. I’m one of a group of researchers at the University of St Andrews trying to change that. How we ought to value the universe depends on two other intriguing philosophical questions.READ MORE: Life on Mars a real possibility as Nasa finds ‘organic matter’Question #2: the kind of life we are most likely to discover elsewhere is microbial – so how should we view this lifeform? Most people would accept that all humans have intrinsic value, and matter not only in relation to their usefulness to someone else. Accept this and it follows that ethics places limits on how we may treat them and their living spaces.People are starting to accept that the same is true of mammals, birds and other animals. So what about microbial beings? Some philosophers like Albert Schweitzer and Paul Taylor have previously argued that all living things have a value in themselves, which would obviously include microbes. Philosophy as a whole has not reached a consensus, however, on whether it agrees with this so-called biocentrism.            Question #3: for planets and other places not hospitable to life, what value should we place on their environment? Arguably we care about our environment on Earth primarily because it supports the species that live here. If so, we might extend the same thinking to other planets and moons that can support life.But this doesn’t work for “dead” planets. Some have proposed an idea called aesthetic value, that certain things should be treasured not because they are useful but because they are aesthetically wonderful. They have applied this not only to great artistic works like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Beethoven’s Fifth, but also to parts of the Earth’s environment, such as the Grand Canyon. Could that apply to other planets?Supposing we could answer these theoretical questions, we could proceed to four important practical questions about space exploration.Question #4: is there a duty to protect the environment on other planets? When it comes to sending astronauts, instruments or robots to other worlds, there are clearly important scientific reasons for making sure they don’t take terrestrial organisms with them and wind up depositing them there.            Otherwise, if we discovered life, we wouldn’t know whether it was indigenous – not to mention the risk of wiping it out entirely. But is scientific clarity all that matters, or do we need to start thinking about galactic environmental protection?READ MORE: Touch the sky: 40 years of space travelQuestion #5: what, besides biological contamination, would count as violating such an obligation to treat that planet’s environment with respect? Drilling for core samples, perhaps, or leaving instruments behind, or putting tyre tracks in the dirt?Question #6: what about asteroids? The race is well underway to develop technology to harvest the untold trillions of pounds of mineral wealth presumed to exist on asteroids, as already reported in The Conversation. It helps that no one seems to think of asteroids as environments we need to protect. The same goes for empty space. The movie Gravity gave us some human-centred reasons to be worried about the buildup of debris in space, but might there be other reasons to object? If so, would our obligation be to merely create less debris, or something stronger – like not producing any new debris or even cleaning up what we’ve left already?Question #7: what considerations might offset arguments in favour of behaving ethically in space? Of the various reasons for going there – intellectual/scientific, utilitarian, profit-driven – are any strong enough to override our obligations?            We also need to factor in the inevitable risks and uncertainties here. We can’t know what benefits space missions will have. We can’t be certain of not biologically contaminating the planets we visit. What risk/reward trade-offs should we be willing to undertake?Discussions about outer space have the advantage that we have very little attachment to anything out there. These ethical questions might therefore be some of the only ones humans can address with a large measure of emotional distance. For this reason, answering them might help us to make progress with Earth-bound issues like global warming, mass extinction and nuclear waste disposal.Space exploration also directly raises questions about our relationship to Earth – once we overcome the technological puzzles preventing the terraforming of a planet like Mars, or find ways of reaching habitable exoplanets. I’ll leave you with one extremely important one for the future:Question #8: given that the Earth is not the only potential home for human beings, what reasons for protecting its environment would remain once we can realistically go somewhere else?Benjamin Sachs is a senior lecturer in philosophy at St Andrews University.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

in the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nTuesday 17 Jul 2018 12:37

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land.

Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

It has created uncertainty and trepidation in sections of our community and for others an anticipation of constitutional change. \n\"So even without a specific timeframe, it is becoming apparent to a growing cross-section of opinion that partition is running out of road.\" \n\nThe Derry man also said all sections of society should be preparing for such constitutional change. \n\"A refusal to discuss or engage in preparations for such seismic change would be a wilful dereliction of duty and risks a return to the bad old days. \n\"The outworking of these dynamics, however, need not be a threat. in reality the reinforce the imperative for political engagement and dialogue.

A sculpture, perhaps modelled on the Washington Memorial Wall, on which could be inscribed the names of every person killed as a result of the 30 years war that ended in 1998.

We are getting ready for a busy summer season and are sure the visitors will enjoy the improved gardens on site.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.7966667.1495101436!/image/image.jpg","title":"in full all 18 venues for this year s twelfth of july demonstrations","story":"\nThe Orange Institution has confirmed the 18 venues across Northern Ireland which will host Twelfth of July demonstrations this summer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\nPreparations are at an advanced stage for the largest day in the parading calendar, with upwards of an estimated half-a-million people expected to participate or spectate in what is widely regarded as the largest annual festival in the Province.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs is tradition, Armagh will once again host the biggest Twelfth gathering ‘in the world’ as Orangemen and women from across the county congregate in the village of Richhill.
