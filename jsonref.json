Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

A new view would do us all well, and with that in mind, people across the world – from Beirut, to the French Antilles, to Hawaii – have been making short videos of what’s right outside their windows to share so we can still explore during quarantine.See someone’s world from their window in Oxford, Michigan, where the reflection of emerald trees bounces off the water. See potted plants dance in the breeze in Honolulu. If it’s chaos you’re craving, opt for the busy bustling road in London’s Brixton, where red buses and white vans hurry past tower blocks seemingly unaware of the menacing dark cloud hovering above.Sonali Ranjit and Vaishnav Balasubramaniam started the WindowSwap project while under lockdown in Singapore by asking a few close friends to share the view from their windows with them. In June they expanded it, asking people to send in 10 minutes of horizontal video via email, to be uploaded on their website. They have received hundreds of submissions from dozens of countries across the world since. “Until we can explore our planet responsibly again I guess, this is a way to travel without moving,” says Ranjit over the telephone from Singapore.They have made small discoveries since then, like the ability to trade places for a moment with people in places they had never heard of seeing the view of an 81-year-old woman in Massachusetts who couldn’t send a video because she didn’t know how, but sent a beautiful photo instead understanding the natural knack of teenagers in cities for making high-quality videos and nothing quite compares to the appeal of a slightly pixellated, grainy video from a small town.“I feel, they have so much character and it’s the beauty of this thing we started, that continues to transform,” says Balasubramaniam."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6b4914300f6b4b7d3859c17695bc0c9896dbffa/0_24_1608_964/master/1608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e76dcfb5cee0e93c70fd25fad6ce8bbe","title":"great british art quiz harris museum preston","story":"Preston’s Harris Museum set today’s quiz in our series that explores the art collections of British museums closed due to Covid-19 while testing your knowledgeThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

China’s stock market has just suffered its worst one-day fall in five months.As this chart shows, we’ve not seen such a big fall since Chinese investors returned from the Lunar New Year break on 3rd February (as the Covid-19 crisis was raging). But clearly the decline in retail sales has caused serious jitters - suggesting that households are still too nervous to spend heavily in the shops.Consumer-focused firms and technology companies led today’s rout:Beijing’s stimulus measures seem to be boosting manufacturing, but not feeding through to consumption. As Tapas Strickland, an economist at National Australia Bank, put it:“Maybe today there’s some kind of realisation that while the industrial side of the economy is really being driven by fiscal stimulus, the consumer side of the economy is a bit more problematic,” China has also hit back at the UK for banning Huawei from its superfast 5G mobile network.In a stern warning, the commerce ministry says the decision will make China warier of investing in the UK, and pledged to take measures in response.... Reuters has the details: Britain’s “discriminatory” ban on Huawei has severely damaged China’s investment confidence in the country, China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday, adding it will take necessary measures to defend Chinese firms’ legal rights.Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from Britain’s 5G network by the end of 2027.This chart from Bloomberg shows how China’s economy returned to growth in April-June, but still weak in historic terms:Stephen Innes, Chief Global Markets Strategist at AxiCorp, has put his finger on the problem with today’s Chinese economic data -- consumers aren’t really spending yet.China’s Q2 GDP growth beat consensus expectation, which is unambiguously positive for risk sentiment. But its what under the hood that matters most.No matter how much stimulus and fiscal sugar you try to entice consumers with, they will not leave their apartment and go on a spending spree until they feel confident the landscape is virus-free. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, is optimistic that China’s economy will avoid shrinking again this year, due to solid domestic demand.Kuijs explains (via the FT):In China the story is very reliant on what is happening domestically.“While in general it’s fair to say that the numbers beat expectations, what the numbers also reveal is that we’re seeing that the China consumer remains behind in terms of the recovery story.Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has plucked out some of the highlights:Iikka Korhonen, head of Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, is also concerned by weak consumer demand:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.China has become the first major economy to return to growth since the Covid-19 pandemic began. But, a surprise drop in retail sales in June suggests there is more economic turbulence ahead. Liu Aihua, spokeswoman for the country’s National Statistics Bureau, told reporters tht China is enjoying “a momentum of restorative growth and gradual recovery”. “We are confident on the economic recovery in the second half of this year,”But Liu also warned there are “mounting external risks and challenges”, as Covid-19 cases continue to rise at a record pace.Reaction to follow...Britain’s unemployment crisis has deepened this morning, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that 649,000 people have dropped off payrolls since March. And if you account for inflation, basic pay is falling as well - meaning significant pain for households:Our UK Coronavirus blog has more details:It’s a busy day generally, with the European Central Bank’s governing council setting monetary policy today, and new US retail sales and unemployment data."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891531437924319e49d2ae588380ab9627d56399/0_125_5220_3131/master/5220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86f172680741caebfd42cec65ebdef11","title":"coronavirus contracts government transparency pandemic","story":"Deals worth billions have been granted by a government willing to brazen out disgrace until outrage subsidesThis stinks. It stinks worse than any of the other carrion this government has buried. Every day for the past fortnight, I’ve been asking myself why this scandal isn’t all over the front pages. Under cover of the pandemic, the government has awarded contracts worth billions of pounds for equipment on which our lives depend, without competition or transparency. It has trampled on its own rules, operated secretly and made incomprehensible and – in some cases – highly questionable decisions.Let’s begin with the latest case, unearthed by investigative journalists at the  and openDemocracy. It involves a contract to test the effectiveness of the government’s coronavirus messaging, worth £840,000. It was issued by the Cabinet Office, which is run by Michael Gove. The deal appears to have been struck on 3 March, but the only written record in the public domain is a letter dated 5 June, retrospectively offering the contract that had already been granted. There was no advertisement for the work, and no competition. No official notice of the award has yet been published. The deal appears to have been done with a handshake and a slap on the back.But we do know who the contract went to. It’s a company called Public First, owned by a married couple, James Frayne and Rachel Wolf. Since 2000, Frayne has worked on political campaigns with Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser. When Gove was education secretary, he brought both Cummings and Frayne into his department. Cummings was Gove’s chief political adviser, while Frayne was his director of communications. At roughly the same time, in 2010, Gove’s department awarded Wolf a £500,000 contract to promote his “free schools” obsession. Guess what? That didn’t go to competitive tender, either. Wolf co-wrote the Conservative party’s election manifesto in 2019.In response to these latest revelations, the government claims it had to override the usual rules for public procurement because it was responding to an emergency. There are several problems with this claim. The first is that six weeks elapsed between the government’s first recognition that coronavirus presented a potentially serious public health risk and striking the deal with Public First. The second is that, of the four contracted services later listed on the government’s website, two were not for testing the government’s coronavirus messaging at all, but for “EU exit comms”: in other words, Brexit. The coronavirus work, according to this list, did not begin until 27 May. The Cabinet Office now claims that when it said “EU exit”, it meant coronavirus. This seems an odd mistake to make.The third problem is that the government’s communications on the pandemic have been disastrous. Did it choose to ignore Public First’s “emergency” work, or was it of little value?On Friday, the Good Law Project (GLP) issued proceedings in the high court against Gove, alleging breaches of procurement law and apparent bias in the granting of the contract to his longstanding associates. It is crowdfunding the challenge.If the government had to provide the money upfront, why didn’t it order the gowns itself? And why, of all possible outsourcers, did it choose PestFix? In the two weeks before it awarded this contract, it was approached by 16,000 companies offering to supply personal protective equipment (PPE). Some of them had a long track record in manufacturing or supplying PPE, and had stocks that could be deployed immediately.Again, the government relies on the emergency defence to justify its decision. But it issued its initial guidance on preventing infection among health and care workers on 10 January. On 14 February, it published specific guidance on the use of PPE. So why did it wait until 13 April to strike its “emergency” deal with PestFix? Moreover, it appears to have set the company no deadline for the delivery of the gowns. Astonishingly, even today only half of them appear to have reached the UK, and all those are still sitting in a warehouse in Daventry. On the government’s own admission, “none of the isolation suits delivered so far has been supplied into the NHS”. So much for taking urgent action in response to the emergency.Again, the contract is surrounded by secrecy. Crucial sections, such as the price paid for the gowns, have been redacted. Bizarrely, the award notice initially stated that the contract was worth £108m. But in responding to the lawsuit, the government now says the real value is £32m. Apparently, it struck “further contracts” with PestFix for other items of equipment. It has so far failed to reveal what these might be, or to publish the contracts. It is worth remembering that while all this was happening, frontline health and care workers were dying as a result of inadequate supplies of PPE.There are plenty of other cases: such as the employment agency with net assets of £623 that was awarded an £18m government contract to supply face masks the confectionery wholesaler that according to the GLP was given a £100m contract to supply PPE and the £250m channelled through a “family office” registered in Mauritius, specialising in currency trading, offshore property and private equity, also to supply protective medical equipment. Altogether, billions of pounds’ worth of contracts appear to have been granted, often to surprising companies, without competition. I think we may reasonably ask what the hell is going on.This is not just about value for money, important as that is. Transparent, competitive tendering is a crucial defence against cronyism and corruption. It is essential to integrity in public life and public trust in politics. But the government doesn’t seem to care. As the scandal over Cummings’ trip to Durham shows, its strategy is to brazen out disgrace until public outrage subsides. We know it cheats and lies. It knows that we know, and it doesn’t care.But these things matter. People die when the government gets them wrong. Our challenge is to discover how to make them count."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804dba34fc1771cfe51ec34d6d1623644b3d62ac/0_109_5855_3512/master/5855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a2b7cfa4a6995b00b7003632159fc5","title":"something else to worry about again massages are back","story":"I’ve been pounded and pummelled in Warsaw, Manchester, Brisbane … and I still haven’t got the hang of the etiquetteWith massages now unlocked-down in England, may I urge the industry to take this opportunity to clarify something important: should pants be on or off? I have tended to assume the latter, but more than once I have caused some consternation, having apparently made the wrong call. This has been excruciating. Subsequently, I’ve presented myself fully underpanted and been told, almost as excruciatingly, to remove them. Which is it: on or off?I don’t have regular massages, but neither am I a novice. In my time I have been bashed about by various people around the world, most memorably a terrifying Polish chap in Warsaw, a half-French Ulsterwoman in Manchester and a small but ferocious Thai Australian just south of Brisbane.My worst experience was at a fancy hotel in Croatia. Looking askance at my swimming shorts, the woman grunted an instruction to drop them as she raised a towel to spare herself the sight of me. Seeking to avoid more confusion, I asked for confirmation that I should lie face down.“Yes,” said the voice behind the towel. So face down I lay, but as she lowered the towel she beheld me and barked: “Other way!”Puzzled, I lay on my back. Down came the towel again, before being abruptly raised again.“No,” she said.“Head other end,” she explained. “Face down,” she added, for clarity.Whatever Croatian is for “I’ve got a right one here”, it is what she was surely saying to herself. And my gravest error was still ahead of us: at that point I should have got off the table and back on to it the right way around and down. Instead, I elected to execute a kind of breakdance manoeuvre, spinning on my back to get my head up the other end. In doing so my feet snagged in the towel she was holding, snapping it out of her hands.A blur of panicked activity followed. The woman, the towel and I flailed around to get me covered and in the correct position, as a matter of urgency.The rest of the massage passed without incident."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c0b0aa0e0401da3344b171529d99f42aa5e31a/0_192_5228_3137/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57c5ee66b1dd1908a77b668bc15b4b66","title":"the class of covid 19 meet the school leavers facing an uncertain future","story":"Six months ago, school leavers were looking forward to the usual hedonistic summer before starting work, apprenticeships or further education. Then coronavirus changed everythingFor three years, Ione Gildroy worked on Saturdays in her local library. The 18-year-old from Leicestershire issued and returned books, organised children’s events and stacked bookshelves. She planned to pool her earnings with some compensation she’d received after being in a car accident to pay for her dream gap year: Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bali, Australia. Working in a turtle rehabilitation centre on the Great Barrier Reef. An elephant sanctuary in Thailand.Gildroy booked the trip at the beginning of January. She’d heard of coronavirus then, but wasn’t worried. “I didn’t think it would even slightly affect my travelling plans,” she says. Gildroy looked forward to the summer of her dreams: a joint 18th birthday party with friends and then off backpacking.But then coronavirus hit. Her travel plans were ruined her raucous 18th birthday party was a picnic with her mum and a socially distanced visit to her grandmother’s. “It feels like all the rites of passage you go through when you turn 18 we haven’t gotten to go through,” says Gildroy. “I turned 18, but I haven’t been out for a drink anywhere. We only knew it was our last day of school the day before. We didn’t have to do our exams, sure, but I would have preferred to have done A-levels, and got all the good stuff that goes with it, such as going on holiday or having my prom.”These are strange times for this year’s cohort of A-level students. Schools and colleges closed in March exams were cancelled. Sectors young people would normally seek casual employment in, such as retail or hospitality, have been shedding staff at an alarming rate. Many universities, including Cambridge, are moving to online tuition. Apprenticeship opportunities have largely evaporated. For school leavers, this is a crucial time: deciding whether to travel, work or go to university. The pace of change at the age of 17 or 18 is the equivalent to years as an adult. But now, with plans shattered, these young people are facing a year in limbo.“Everything just feels really uncertain,” says Ben Forrest, 18, from Bradford. Like many others, Forrest had carefully sketched out his summer: two music festivals and a joint birthday party before studying journalism at the University of Leeds. “Before this happened, I was really excited,” he says. “Now I don’t know what to do with myself. When I’m occupied and doing stuff, I’m all right, but when you have those days when you’re not doing owt, it’s not great for the mental health side of things.”Although lockdown restrictions are being eased, there is no timeline for the reopening of clubs and festivals, and many teenagers have lost the part-time jobs they rely on to fund those activities. Forrest has been trying to make the most of the downtime: he is reading a lot and meeting friends in the park. But he still feels pretty down. “The summer between A-levels and uni is meant to be the best time of your life,” he says. “I’ve just spent it in my room.” Among Forrest’s friendship group, the levels of ennui are high. “Everyone is just disappointed, fed up and bored,” he says.Losing your freedom and autonomy just as you are trying to make your mark in the world can feel devastatingly limiting. “Emerging adulthood is the period when people are trying to reach lift-off in their adult lives,” says Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts. “That time is really difficult, and to have that all come to an end, even temporarily, is painful.” He explains that the lockdown will be felt more acutely by 18- to 24-year-olds than any other generation. “You’ve gone through puberty, with the rush of hormones that entails,” says Arnett. “You’re confronting big questions about what you want your future to look like. When you’re thwarted from exploring those questions as you had intended, you’re likely to see anxiety and depression.”Covid-19 has also forced school leavers to make hard calculations about their future: do they push ahead with their university plans or defer for a year in the hope that a vaccine will be made available, and that they will be able to have a more typical student experience? Faced with the prospect of online-only learning and a lacklustre, socially distanced freshers’ week, many students are choosing to defer. “I feel like with university next year, my education will be very halfhearted,” says Jawwad Khan, 18, from London. “Especially when you’re paying £9,250 a year for online learning. It’s like buying an online book over a real book. You’d rather have the real book.”Like Khan, 17-year-old Morgan Davies, from Warrington, is also deferring. He has a scholarship to the University of North Carolina to study economics. “I really wanted the full freshman experience,” Davies says. “I wanted to ‘rush a frat’ and go to Halloween parties.” In anticipation of the college year, he had befriended his roommates online, and socialised with them on Zoom.But Davies’s university is moving to online learning, meaning there will be no in-person lectures or frat parties. At first, Davies thought he could study from his dorm, but the US immigration authorities recently announced that international students would not be allowed into the US if their courses were online-only, meaning that Davies faces the prospect of spending his first year at university in his bedroom in Warrington, studying in US time zones. “For me,” Davies explains, “university is about being physically present … although it wouldn’t affect me academically, being there was a huge part of going to the US. I thought I’d rather delay a year and get the full experience.”Not all students plan to defer. “I’m definitely starting university in September,” says 18-year-old Lily Good, from Aylesbury, who plans to study politics and sociology at the University of Exeter. “I was umming and ahhing, and wasn’t really sure what to do. But things are reopening now, and I’ve spent so much time at home this year. I honestly cannot wait to go somewhere new, meet new people and have a new start in a different place.” Good is optimistic that she will be able to have a relatively normal student experience. “I think that, even if social distancing is officially in place, I can’t imagine 18- and 19-year-old students staying apart, especially in halls and stuff. And, hopefully, the clubs won’t be shut for too long.”Already, there are indications that exam boards may mark this cohort of students harshly. After the international baccalaureate (IB) examiners released its grades this month, online forums erupted in fury: scores of students felt their grades had been unduly marked down, causing them to miss out on university offers. The IB grading body is now being investigated by England’s exams regulator, Ofqual. “I’m stressed,” Finiin says. “I worked so hard for the offer, and I was ready to transition all my efforts into getting the grades. If I don’t get the grades, I don’t know what I’ll do.”If you had banked on entering the world of work via an apprenticeship, now is just about the worst possible time to be a school leaver. “Apprenticeship vacancies have collapsed,” says Kathleen Henehan of the Resolution Foundation. “There were just under 2,000 apprenticeship vacancies in England this May, compared with 13,000 the May previously.” This month, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced incentives for employers to hire more apprentices. “It’s a nice step, but there’s a big question mark as to whether that’s enough to incentivise employers struggling to hire them,” says Henehan.Mason Gunn, 16, from North Shields, left school this year. He planned to find a level-one electrical apprenticeship. “Most companies I’ve spoken to have said if it wasn’t for Covid they would have taken me on,” he says. “They all said the same thing – ‘lack of work due to Covid’ but they would ‘keep me in mind’.” Gunn has phoned or emailed more than 35 local firms, with no luck. “I’m trying to stay positive because I understand that many of these companies are struggling to pull in money, so having an apprenticeship would only make things difficult.”And young people who had hoped to enter the workforce straight away will find themselves on the sharp end of hiring freezes. “School leavers always tend to suffer during recessions because there are fewer vacancies,” Henehan says. “And when firms are hiring, they want someone with more experience.” She explains that during the 2008 crisis, graduates were pushed into jobs previously taken by non-graduates – leaving the non-graduates jobless. “I’m kind of scrambling to get work even remotely related to the field of work I want to do,” says Marianne Zamgoni, 18, from Doncaster.Zamgoni planned to get a job as a trainee estate agent on leaving school: she was getting interviews for positions before Covid-19 hit, and then everything dried up. She has applied for 50 jobs in the past three months, with no luck. “I have signed up for every job website under the sun,” she says, “and whenever I get an alert about a new job post, I apply for it.” All the firms who come back say the same thing: they’re on a hiring freeze. Zamgoni is trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard to not be dispirited. “It can be quite depressing every time you open an email and it says: ‘Sorry to inform you …’” she says. “My future feels very uncertain.”The Resolution Foundation recently predicted that more than a million young people would be unemployed in the coming years. “I wouldn’t want to be 18 right now,” sighs Henehan. “In terms of the labour market, it’s too soon to tell if this recession will be worse than it was in the 1980s, where we had mass youth unemployment, but it’s possible … it certainly looks more challenging than the 2008 financial crisis. At least in this century, this is the worst time to be a young person.”Being 18 right now can feel a little like being a member of a cursed generation. “We’ve had it so bad,” says 18-year-old Aisha Akram from Manchester. “We had the new GCSEs, when there was a new curriculum and no past papers. And now Covid.” Akram, who plans to study psychology at the University of Manchester next year, worries about her generation’s long-term prospects with a recession looming. “It’s probably going to be really hard to get a job when I graduate,” she says. Some of Akram’s friends think deferring will improve their job prospects – the labour market should be in better shape by then – but Henehan says that is far from certain: “If everyone stays in education a bit longer, they all exit en masse, and will be competing for the same jobs.”Finiin’s friends have started jokingly referring to themselves as the “class of Covid-19”. “I remember our economics teacher joking about coronavirus in January, and everyone was laughing,” Finiin says, “and then – bam! – we were all locked down in our houses and school was cancelled. Everything happened at once. I think we’ll look back in a few years and think: ‘Wow, how did that happen?’”But Akram is confident that the class of Covid-19 will emerge victorious, pointing to the Fridays for Future climate crisis movement and the recent Black Lives Matter protests as evidence of Generation Z’s commitment to making a positive impact on the world. “All these protests will equate to something,” Akram says. “We’ve been hard done by, but in the end we will come out stronger. Our generation is going to make a big change in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/823b41c7109656ae2087efbc7aec4616dc77866a/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=944e3f23da8c9abe24ff6a6b25f97d29","title":"climate change made siberian heatwave 600 times more likely study","story":"Human fingerprint on record temperatures ‘has rarely, if ever, been clearer’, says reportThe record-breaking heatwave in the Siberian Arctic was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused climate change, according to a study. Between January and June, temperatures in the far north of Russia were more than 5C above average, causing permafrost to melt, buildings to collapse, and sparking an unusually early and intense start to the forest fires season. On 20 June, a monitoring station in Verkhoyansk registered a record high of 38C. An attribution study shows such prolonged heat over the first six months of the year would have been almost impossible without the effect of greenhouse gas emissions from industry, transport and farming.The team of researchers from international universities and meteorological services, including the PP Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in the Russian Academy of Science, calculated this human impact added at least 2C of warming to the region.The authors of the study say the Siberian heat would happen less than once in every 80,000 years without human interference.Andrew Ciavarella, a lead author of the research and senior detection and attribution scientist at the Met Office, said the findings were staggering. “This research is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming global climate. Importantly, an increasing frequency of these extreme heat events can be moderated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”Scientists say the human fingerprint has rarely, if ever, been clearer. “This is the largest signal we have seen,” said Friederike Otto, the acting director of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute and a co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative. “This study shows again just how much of a game-changer climate change is with respect to heatwaves. As emissions continue to rise, we need to think about building resilience to extreme heat all over the world, even in Arctic communities – which would have seemed nonsensical not very long ago.”Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique\u0026nbsplast year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.The need for stronger resilience was evident when melting permafrost and poorly maintained equipment led to one of Russia’s worst oil spills, from a power station near the industrial city of Norilsk, on 29 May.Prof Olga Zolina, of the Institute of Oceanology in Moscow and another lead author, said the fate of Norilsk could be an indicator of what lies in store for other northern communities. “It means we should do something. This town is very small, with about 1,000 inhabitants. But there are other bigger cities in the Arctic circle. For them the mounting high temperatures are very important.”Concerns are also growing that the high temperatures are worsening positive feedback loops by melting heat-reflecting ice and increasing the range and intensity of wildfires in Siberia, which is home to the world’s largest forest.The season’s fires started unusually early, in April, and have been detected further north than ever before. According to the EU’s Copernicus satellite monitoring service, Siberian blazes released 59 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in June, the highest amount on record.Nasa says some embers smoulder through the winter in peatlands and then flare back to life in the spring. The dangers of such “zombie fires” is increased by warmer temperatures. The melting of the tundra also increases the risks of a release of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Since the middle of June, the extent of the fires has more than doubled to more than a million hectares.The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, but the trend towards more extreme conditions is apparent elsewhere. At the start of the year, Australia had unprecedented bushfires and Antarctica registered exceptionally high temperatures. The UK Met Office is more cautious. Despite several record months, it said global average surface temperatures in 2020 were still not at 2016 levels and a cooling La Niña was now developing. “While 2020 is running very high, there is no guarantee of a record this year,” said Prof Adam Scaife, the head of Met Office long-range prediction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c686a50667410ec40973b7738e9e12334657d787/0_3_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=efc15c9dd024b1929ad9109259d6c125","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

I found myself utterly absorbed – more so because I went away and read the 1924 short story on which it’s based, by the Austrian author Robert Musil, known for his monumental and unfinished The Man Without Qualities.In the early 16th century, an unnamed Portuguese noblewoman (played by newcomer Clara Riedenstein) has married the aristocratic Lord von Ketten (Marcello Urgheghe). When he goes to war in Italy, she stays behind with her retinue and ladies-in-waiting, waiting for his return for over a decade in a becalmed state of torpor and inscrutable discontent. When her husband finally does come back, exhausted, unwell, disillusioned with war’s supposed glories and embittered after peace negotiations with his enemy, the Bishop of Trent (Alexandre Alves Costa), he conceives a jealous dislike of his wife’s attractive young cousin, Pero Lobato (João Vicente), who has come to visit. There is a haggard choric figure of an old woman, played by the veteran German star and Fassbinder veteran Ingrid Caven.Everything about the movie is uncompromisingly andante: there are static shots, wonderfully composed painterly tableaux, with highly wrought details and focal points to be noticed in various corners of the frame, perhaps inspired by Velásquez (although at other times cinematographer Acácio de Almeida has apparently taken something from Millais’ Ophelia or Leonardo’s Lady With an Ermine).The Portuguese woman capriciously decides to make a pet of a feral cat and also a wolf cub that becomes full-grown under her care, a development replete with heraldic significance – and she is enraged when her husband takes against the animal. There is something amazingly unworldly in this film: it is a challenge, certainly, and needs an investment of attention, but there is a gorgeous refinement and intelligence to it.• The Portuguese Woman is available on Mubi from 20 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54b6d3427d2ff49aa86c49c08f240f06addf5706/110_21_1554_932/master/1554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56ad0a53768d93f6c98c32e9ec777c54","title":"labour asks government to deliver manifesto pledge of fan led review","story":"The Labour Party has called on the government to “deliver on its manifesto pledge to football fans” by implementing a review into the reform of the game.The sustainability of the football pyramid has been called into question amid the Covid-19 crisis, while long-running issues over governance contributed to Wigan Athletic’s dramatic slump into administration this past month.The government had promised a “fan-led” review into the structures of the national game in its election manifesto last year but has yet to commission the review or draw up its terms of reference.Alison McGovern, the shadow minister for sport, has written to the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, asking for a cross-party process to deliver the committee, which she says “must be genuinely driven by what fans want and need, from the grassroots up”.In her letter, McGovern also pointed to a previous review, commissioned by the digital, culture, media and sport committee in 2011, that said “big changes need to be made to the way football is run in England to address financial instability” but which was never fully implemented.“Almost ten years on, the situation is becoming urgent,” she wrote. “Like other challenges in our country, Covid-19 has magnified the long-term structural challenges for football. What happened at Wigan Athletic is a perfect example.“Labour MPs are very concerned about the financial future for many clubs in the immediate term and we believe that no community should lose a much-loved club and local institution as a result. We hope this is an objective the government can support.”Talks between the government and football’s governing bodies have been ongoing during the pandemic and were central to enabling the restart of the Premier League and Championship.One government condition of the return of live football was that it should ultimately provide financial benefit to the whole football pyramid. There remain, however, significant differences of opinion over how that should play out, with the EFL calling for a bailout of the lower leagues and the Premier League insisting it has done all it can by advancing monies that otherwise might not have been paid.The review, it has been determined, will assess the controversial owners’ and directors’ test, which played a part in the disastrous Wigan takeover in June. The department for digital, culture, media and sport confirmed that other details had yet to be decided.“The government has committed to a fan-led review of football governance, which will include consideration of the owners’ and directors’ test,” it said. “We will shortly be deciding on the scope and structure of the review and will announce further details in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f89928413bdb03676d5daea68a915207ea780ad2/0_346_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44e61d9027588880137edf63641ee173","title":"amazon indigenous covid 19 remote reserve","story":"The Covid-19 virus has reached a remote reserve for recently contacted indigenous people in the Peruvian Amazon, despite efforts to shield the extremely vulnerable population from the pandemic.At least six coronavirus cases have been recorded among the Nahua people, who have lived mostly in voluntary isolation since they were first contacted in the 198os. Fewer than a thousand members of the group live in the Kugapakori-Nahua-Nanti territorial reserve, an expanse of 4,556 sq km (1,763 sq miles) in Peru’s southern Amazon.The report has prompted alarm among Amazon indigenous activists who have repeatedly warned that coronavirus could cause a disastrous repeat of previous pandemics that devastated their populations.The Covid-19 cases were focused in Santa Rosa de Serjali, a settlement of 391 Nahua people which has been in “initial contact” with the outside world for three decades, according to Peru’s culture ministry.Health workers have visited and seven tonnes of food along with masks and other supplies have been left at the community, the ministry reported.A 47-year-old non-indigenous man, the partner of a Nahua woman, was reportedly the first community member to show symptoms of the virus. He was initially treated for a respiratory infection until he was taken to Sepahua, the nearest town, and diagnosed with Covid-19.Health workers say the infection could become widespread among the Nahua, who often lack immunity to introduced diseases, even the common cold.Health workers detected more than 150 Covid-19 cases among eight indigenous populations in Sepahua, which is believed to have been the point of infection for the Nahua. No deaths have been reported, according to a statement from the culture ministry.Other remote communities on the border with Brazil have also reported coronavirus cases. Peru recognizes 20 indigenous groups in voluntary isolation and “initial contact”, numbering about 7,000 in total.Indigenous groups protested about the lack of government attention this week. While there are no official numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths among Peru’s indigenous population, Aidesep, the umbrella Amazon indigenous federation said there were more than 15,000 cases and at least 500 deaths.In April, Aidesep accused the Peruvian state of “ethnocide by inaction” in a formal complaint to the UN and international courts for allegedly failing to adequately protect indigenous people from the coronavirus pandemic.Covid-19 has already struck deep into isolated Amazon regions of Brazil, Colombia and Peru. The Pan-Amazonian Ecclesiastical Network, Repam, part of the Catholic church, reported 565,779 Covid-19 cases and 16,949 deaths across the rainforest region, which covers seven countries.Peru is the fifth-worst-affected country in the world and second in Latin America, with 333,867 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 12,229 deaths on Wednesday, according to John Hopkins University.The Financial Times recently reported that based on population size, Peru had one of the world’s highest excess mortality rates, measured as the number of deaths above the normal average number, during the pandemic period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b222e114b57e6250f9fc9efd84b813a45c8408e1/0_289_5362_3218/master/5362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92e66e22650645e87961d622207394e6","title":"artists kabul mural artlords afghan imagery corruption","story":"Muralists are covering the Afghan capital’s blast walls with agitprop imagery and calling out corruptionby  Stefanie Glinski in KabulFrom the killing of George Floyd in the US and the drowning of Afghan refugees in Iran, to the signing of the US-Taliban agreement towards peace and brutal murder of a Japanese aid worker, a group of Afghan artists have taken paintbrushes to adorn Kabul’s grey blast walls with vivid imagery.The barriers have been transformed into politically inspired murals, which the artists hope will create “visual dialogue” and raise awareness of corruption and injustices.The war-torn Afghan capital is full of these large concrete barriers, often separating diplomatic and governmental headquarters from the rest of the otherwise beautiful city of rolling hills and old brick houses.The worsening security situation and countless attacks have seen more blast walls built all over Kabul, blocking off roads and sheltering buildings and people from potential suicide bombs.Kabul’s green zone, a highly fortified area home to embassies and news agencies, is surrounded by tall, heavy walls.Since 2014, Artlords – a word play on warlords and drug lords, of which Afghanistan has many – a collective of artists and volunteers, has put some of the country’s politics into paintings, aiming to reflect the city’s atmosphere.“We want to turn public opinion into murals, that’s why we paint what we hear on the streets,” explained Abrar Kakarr, Artlords’ programme manager. “We don’t want to offend, we want to criticise.”The group recently sketched a portrait of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man killed by police in Minneapolis, as well as a mural of Afghan refugees drowning in a river in Iran after fleeing their home country It is alleged that Iranian border guards forced them into the water at gunpoint.“We painted those in a day,” Kakarr said. “We usually electronically project the image against the wall and then e into the painting process with brushes, ladders and a bunch of volunteers.”Another mural, of the head of a Japanese aid agency, Tetsu Nakamura, who specialised in irrigation projects and was killed by gunmen in the eastern city of Jalalabad in December, went up in Kabul shortly after his murder. “Let’s not plant anything but the seed of love and friendship in this pure land,” a line next to his painted profile reads.The group has 10 members of staff, including some artists, and around 35 volunteers.All this inspired Artlords co-founders Omaid Sharifi and Kabir Mokamel to paint their first mural: a pair of eyes and the words “I see you” – aimed at questioning the “corrupt government” and creating dialogue.Since then, the group has painted almost 2,000 murals in 19 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Some work has been commissioned by UN agencies and embassies to raise awareness about the development agenda. But other independent pieces are aimed at stirring political debate.The group – now mainly funded by international donors – has faced praise and criticism. Some have questioned whether beautifying explosion-proof walls denies their purpose and the continuing war in the city, but Artlords has said it will continue to promote messages of peace and social justice, as well as use its work to target alleged government corruption.“Artlords has increased the authorised use of graffiti on the concrete walls segregating military and governmental actors from the public and with it has transformed the city’s walls into public canvases,” says Paniz Musawi Natanzi, a German-Iranian academic who holds a doctorate in gender and cultural politics with a focus on Afghanistan.Some murals may have caused controversy, but so far only one has been removed. Two years ago, the group painted a portrait of Hamida Barmaki, a law professor and human rights activist killed with her husband and four children in a 2011 suicide attack claimed by Hizb-i-Islami militants. The mural, painted on a blast wall near the home of the militants’ leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar – a former mujahiddin chief who has since entered the Afghan government – was quickly removed by Hekmatyar’s men.“They took buckets of paint to it,” Kakarr said. “We hoped to make a point: Look, he has joined the government, but he’s a killer.” His crimes were pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal.“We want to be a voice for the people through our art. We want to make sure that those who are in power hear this voice and feel ashamed. They should know that people have not forgotten the crimes that they have done during the past years,” said Sharifi in response to the vandalising of Barmaki’s memorial mural.Kakarr added: “Politically, we’re facing an uncertain future in Afghanistan. Many people fear the Taliban gaining strength many are directly affected by killings and attacks. We hope our murals can address the suffering and injustices faced and point towards peace.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ecd8944d05d77e5c09b1c7e367989d257a3a7d6/0_0_4917_2949/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3728327d9a335257e899046df7077af0","title":"thank you our glorious revolution activists react as sudan ditches islamist laws","story":"After 30 years under Omar al-Bashir, the country has abolished several discriminatory policies and banned FGM – in what activists have called ‘great first steps’ towards liberalisationSudan’s transitional government has been praised for its latest reforms, which decriminalise apostasy, ban female genital mutilation (FGM) and end the requirement for women to get travel permits.The legislation makes major strides in pushing back against discrimination faced by women and minorities during the 30-year rule of Omar al-Bashir that came to an end in 2019, according to equality advocates.The anti-torture charity Redress and the Sudan-based African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the measures “move Sudan a step closer towards eliminating structural violence against women and minorities”.“We encourage the new government to continue making domestic law and policy reforms until systematic torture is eradicated from the country and justice and reparations are fully realised for victims,” said Charlie Loudon, Redress’s international legal adviser.Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari announced last week that apostasy, which had been used against religious minorities and was punishable by death, would no longer be an offence. In addition, he said, non-Muslims will be allowed to drink alcohol in private.Abdulbari called the reforms “a big stride towards establishing one of the foundations for the victorious December revolution’s slogans, which is freedom”.Sudan’s infamous apostasy laws were highlighted by the case of Meriam Ibrahim, who was raised by a Christian mother, but sentenced to death by a Sudanese court for abandoning Islam, the faith of her father. Ibrahim was freed in 2018 after an international outcry.The reforms follow the abolition in late 2019 of the notorious Public Order Act. Article 152 of the law included the punishment of 40 lashes for women who wore trousers in public. Fagiri had previously claimed that 45,000 women were prosecuted under the Public Order Act in 2016 alone. Ola Diab, the editor of the online Sudanese cultural magazine 500 Words, said the reforms were “great first steps”.“The issue here is implementation of these laws. I think that’s where the challenge will be and where we’ll see if these laws will really bring serious change,” said Diab, noting that she expected social resistance to reforms such as the ban on FGM.She added that many other laws needed to change, including those that have seen victims of rape prosecuted on adultery charges and women in mixed-sex settings accused of prostitution.Loudon said Sudan must ensure steps are taken to enforce the legal changes.“That would be things like amending the internal policies of the relevant government agencies, whether the police, the general intelligence services or the armed forces.“The other thing that would be crucial would be training being put in place,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4369f17da2b8451f2664fc00df29f0ef9d1009ad/0_50_1379_827/master/1379.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7901f67eac1bcb13dfd239538dbff899","title":"the power of touch i miss football hugs now i long for a fetid boozy embrace","story":"Hugging your fellow fans is an act of extraordinary, unlikely bonding. And at Manchester City it’s been raised to another levelWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesThere is a shared ecstasy when the ball hits the back of the net – an unleashing of joy, passion, scarves and primal screams. You probably have nothing in common with your fellow huggers apart from supporting the same team and wearing identical replica shirts. In fact, you may dislike them in real life, and there is a good chance that you will never see them again. It is an extraordinary, unlikely bonding.But the Poznań is something else. Fans of the Polish club Lech Poznań introduced it to Manchester City supporters during a Europa League match in 2010. They turned their backs on the game, wrapped their arms around the shoulders of the supporters on either side of them and repeatedly jumped up and down on the spot in unison. It was a beautiful sight – random, surreal, rhythmic, funny, collective – and utterly senseless.The history of the Poznań is much debated. Some say it started in Poland in the early 60s as a protest by fans against club management others say it originated in Turkey and Greece, and was known as the Grecque. For Manchester City fans, though, it will always be known as the Poznań. After that match against Lech Poznań, we paid homage to its supporters by stealing their crazy hug-dance. We customised it by chanting “Let’s all do the Poznań” to the tune of Do the Conga.It was open to any number of meanings or none. We Poznańed in triumph after scoring, we Poznańed when we were bored, we Poznańed when we were rubbish. Turning our back on the football could be interpreted as supreme confidence (we knew we would win), despair (we knew we would lose) or indifference. Sod the footie, we were there for the craic. It was ludicrous, but it was also an act of love, trust and solidarity. A Poznań did not allow for party-poopers or mavericks (even though it was a maverick act). If one person broke the chain, the Poznań was ruined.Even pre-lockdown the football hug was in danger of disappearing. VAR (the video assistant referee) has taken the spontaneity out of football: rather than hugging when our team scored, we started checking the TV screens to see if a goal really was a goal or just another shattered hope.Meanwhile, the pandemic has robbed us of the opportunity to Poznań. Indeed, common sense may dictate that we never see it again. But football being football, and City fans being City fans, I have a sneaky feeling that when we are finally allowed back into football grounds, we may just celebrate with the most audacious, prolonged Poznań ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd4a87765f892fc784ccf95c7cf1fddd32028c7/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cf4eaf7ecd552d8c7ba318b627c20c","title":"rents rise in england but slide in london as covid 19 affects market","story":"Property website Rightmove said rents outside London hit record £845 a month in early JulyRents have continued to climb across England, but they are sliding in London as Airbnb owners abandon hopes of attracting holidaymakers and put their properties on the long-term rental market.The Rightmove data records asking prices for new properties to rent on its website, and is more volatile than figures from the Office for National Statistics.Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: “The pause in the rental market has led to some distorted figures over the past few months, especially in cities where landlords with short-term lets made the swap to instead try to find a long-term tenant.”He predicted that the legacy of coronavirus will be more tenants seeking a spare room and a garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c7fdb070b7277ccc22eb633bb21ff3fef299e1/0_1800_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961775cab4953c19ffde424d49e6815d","title":"we paid 2227 for our move to france and it got us nowhere","story":"It all went wrong from the start with Doree Bonner … and now we’re having to chase the ombudsmanMy partner and I relocated to France last year and paid moving firm Doree Bonner £2,227 to handle things, which went wrong from the start.

As the Proms celebrate Beethoven’s 250th anniversary, stars reveal a favourite workAlan Hollinghurst, authorBeethoven is a master of compaction and urgency, and more than any other composer he writes startlingly moving fast music. The third movement of the Op 95 string quartet, “vivace ma serioso”, sums it up. I love this quartet for its intensity and compression, the absence of expected repeats which throws you into a “now or never” relationship with the material, and the gripping but mysterious drama of the whole thing. It may lack the aura of the late quartets, started 15 years later, but to me is just as breathtaking and indispensable.The piece I have to pick as my favourite is the Cavatina from the string Quartet, Op 130. It is possibly one of the greatest pieces of music ever. It is so modern and unexpected – you never know what he’s going to do next. The Medicis performed this at John’s memorial service in 2002. We had lots of funny things that day – there was an arrangement of The Sun Has Got His Hat On, which John would sing and dance to if things got edgy on set, and funny tributes – then suddenly there was this moment of utter beauty with this magical piece of music, something that was the soul of John.Music is a great comfort to me at the moment, while in isolation. I have Radio 3 on all the time and I desperately try not to listen to the news. On the night of Brexit, while some people were celebrating and others were having wakes, I stayed in and played Beethoven, his quartets mainly, into the small hours of the morning.I’ve been having spiritual talks recently with a fellow Quaker, trying to define what people call God. I would say that Beethoven’s late string quartets are the nearest to God that we’ll ever get. Their delicacy and intricacy and sheer beauty – can you believe this man was deaf when he wrote them?Kieran Hodgson, comedianIn the loneliest time of my life, Beethoven kept me company. A languages student, I was spending a year in Besançon, France, working and, improbably, living in a massive school known as “the factory”. Each evening, I was left to rattle around the deserted corridors like a ghost, until I discovered the cavernous salle polyvalente and its grand piano. At six o’clock sharp for three months I would sign out the key and spend an hour on the first movement of the Piano Sonata No 5 in C minor. Arpeggio target practice galore, a great party piece – and a much-needed friend.Laura Wade, playwrightI first came across the Violin Sonata, Op 47, the “Kreutzer”, when asked by the Australian Chamber Orchestra to write a play to be performed alongside it, taking inspiration from Tolstoy’s 1889 novella The Kreutzer Sonata. It was love at first listen. In Tolstoy’s novella, a husband suspects his wife, a talented amateur pianist, of having an affair with the violinist with whom she is playing the Kreutzer. Driven mad by the music, he murders her in a jealous rage.The story is queasily fascinated by the power of music to arouse passion, and when listening to the piece you can sense where the husband’s suspicions come from. Just as we endlessly speculate over the chemistry between highly skilled actors playing a love scene, it’s hard not to read the dialogue between the violin and piano parts as an expression of a deeper synchronicity. We are eavesdropping on the best kind of conversation, between two people who are high on each other – riffing off each other’s ideas, each taking the other one’s phrase, turning it around and sending it back brighter each time, building and building.It’s famously difficult to perform – I imagine it brings the players out in a sweat. The violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, to whom the sonata was dedicated, called it “outrageously unintelligible” and refused to perform it. I’m glad other musicians have been less squeamish because I would happily be transported by this piece every day.Beethoven String Quartet in A minor, Op 132 – written in 1825 after he recovered from a nearly fatal intestinal disorder – is my favourite because of its strange third movement. Marked molto adagio, it is about 20 minutes long (depending on your recording) and alternates between slow funereal sections in the key of F and joyful fast movements in D marked “Neue Kraft Fuhlend”, or “feeling new strength”. It is these unexpected leaps of regrowth coming out of the slow sad sections that always fill me with possibility if I am feeling low. A study in hope.Timberlake Wertenbaker, playwrightIt’s very difficult to choose a favourite piece by Beethoven. One of the late quartets? The “Ghost” trio? I have a particular fondness for the Choral Fantasy, especially the end, because it’s so wild and full of hope, and because Beethoven first played it himself and apparently improvised some of it.In the end, my favourite Beethoven has to be Fidelio. An opera set in a prison that is about a political prisoner incarcerated for wanting to reveal corruption has a very contemporary resonance. The heroine is active, intelligent and doesn’t even have to die in the end. It has passages of aching beauty, the finale of course, and earlier on, a brief moment when the prisoners come up into the air and are able “to breathe again”. Apt words, especially these days.Ragnar Kjartansson, artistThe Seventh Symphony, the Allegretto in the second movement comes to mind immediately. It sounds like death and life and love and everything in between! I first heard it at an afterparty in Reykjavík many years ago. Among the much younger people hanging out at the bar was an old man, too. He invited everyone to his home, where he played the Allegretto on a 1960s stereo for us all. It was dramatic and powerful and just so beautiful – I loved it immediately. The movement is a crazy memento mori, it has this curve of longing in it. I also like that you can really hear Handel’s Sarabande in it – it’s almost like a remix of it. I don’t have a favourite recording – I’m not enough of a connoisseur that I can hear nuances of interpretation. Besides, you can’t screw this piece up.Ali Smith, authorI spent a lot of my life believing classical music wasn’t really for me. Then about a decade ago I began listening to a piece of Beethoven every day. I’d heard pieces and been astonished as modernist as Frank Gehry architecture, as timeless as things dug up in Greece from millennia ago, as uncompromising as history, as inventive and colourful as Picasso and Hockney. But I’d no idea where to start. So I began at Opus 1, listened to it every day for a month, then Opus 2 the next month. And so on.It’s not a real chronology, but it gave me a way in, has introduced me to a lot of Beethoven that isn’t commonly listened to, and it’s never not been enlightening, exciting, and a fusion of pleasure and meditation – your mind opens and dimensionalises as you listen, whatever it is, it’ll be layered with an understanding of societal negotiation and of the heft, the shadow and the forward push of time.Right now I’m on Op 117, the overture to Konig Stephan, with its formal double-take, its suggestion of time slippage. My favourites over the decade? The piano sonatas. The piano concertos. The symphonies. (I’m looking forward to a month with the Ninth.) And The Creatures of Prometheus. Life, joy.Es Devlin, artist and set designerMy first encounter with Beethoven was in a community centre in Hastings, sitting at the back of the second violin section in the town’s youth orchestra. My mum would drive me and my sister the 12 miles from Rye every Tuesday night. It was usually dark at 5pm and mainly raining, windscreen wipers going full pelt – and in my memory we always practised the Egmont Overture.I was not the most virtuosic violin player, but I loved being part of a collective sound. I could never quite fathom how my scratched bowing could meld with everyone else’s contribution to become this overwhelming surround-sound that seemed to be so much greater and more magnificent than the sum of all of our wet Hastings Tuesday-night souls.My most recent encounter with Beethoven was on another rainy night on a rooftop carpark in Peckham, the site of Hannah Barry’s Bold Tendencies art project. We had edited theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli’s The Order of Time into a 24-minute large-scale digital artwork. Part of Carlo’s text invokes the painfully beautiful lead violin part in Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis Benedictus, and our composers, Polyphonia, had extracted the solo violin and reset it to accompany the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch reading Rovelli’s meditation on time. In this context, as 2,000 of us including Carlo himself stood on a south London rooftop reading his profound text on the nature of time, beneath the relentless downpour, Beethoven’s music felt almost excruciatingly moving.Tony Hall, director general BBCIn 2004 I went to South Africa to see Cape Town Opera mark 10 years of democracy with a production of Fidelio on Robben Island. I had the privilege of being guided around by former ANC prisoners before the performance and was shown the cell where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years in captivity. It’s always a tricky opera, but as night fell, against the backdrop of a spectacular sunset, the prisoners emerged singing that famous chorus on to a stage set in the real-life prison courtyard. It was unforgettably moving – a celebration of hope and liberation in the most powerful setting possible.Michael Craig-Martin, artistI first heard Beethoven’s Late Quartets at the 92nd Street Y in New York in 1960 when I was a student. I love the clarity and intimacy of chamber music because one can “see” the music being made, and can focus on the contribution of each musician and instrument to the ensemble. The Late Quartets were found unintelligible and dismissed at the time, but proved to be prophetic about the future development of music. They are filled with emotion and the experience of a lifetime. I hear their sadness more clearly now, particularly at this time, than I did at 20.Lady Brenda Hale, former president of the Supreme CourtTwo of Beethoven’s works mean something special to me. One is his Grosse Fuge: a magnificent striding fugue that I used to march round my college room in time to, learning my notes for the Cambridge Law Tripos. The other is his only opera, Fidelio. I first saw this in the Vienna Opera House, a suitably grand setting for a great operatic experience. It is a passionate attack on injustice, autocratic and unaccountable power, and secret prisoners, conquered by the power of the love of a wonderful and courageous woman. My favourite is the vocal quartet Mir ist so wunderbar, four completely incompatible views of what is going on, intricately woven together.Edmund de Waal, artist and authorBeethoven’s Grosse Fuge in B flat major, Op 133 of 1826, was “incomprehensible, like Chinese” according to the critics of the time. It was “a confusion of Babel”. There were passages that could be understood but seemed to have no structure, no development. It was genius in ruins. It was chaotic, angry, complex. Sylvia Plath in her poem Little Fugue on her father and death writes of “The yew hedge of the Grosse Fuge”, a deep and dark and forbidding barrier: “He could hear Beethoven:  Black yew, white cloud,  The horrific complications.  Finger-traps—a tumult of keys.” Lateness needs a response, an understanding of how much is left to achieve. Beethoven’s lateness is powerful because it does not seek resolution. This is why I return to it again and again.Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National GalleryA few weeks after the beginning of the second world war, Kenneth Clark, the director of the National Gallery, asked the pianist Myra Hess to organise some musical concerts in the empty rooms, the pictures having been removed for safekeeping. The very first concert she gave was – perhaps surprisingly for us – almost entirely Germanic music, and included one of Hess’s favourite works, Beethoven’s “Appassionata” sonata. This is a big showy piece (the F minor key allowed Beethoven to use the entire range of the keyboard from the very bottom note) it is difficult, brooding, brilliant and passionate as its (later) title indicates. Clark said that as she played the opening bars: “It was an assurance that all our sufferings were not in vain.” The story of how these lunchtime concerts helped keep up Londoners’ spirits as the bombs rained down is enduringly inspiring.The Grosse Fuge is still absolutely shocking, almost like contemporary music to anybody and it’s always going to sound modern. Every great composer since then has always remarked on that characteristic and for me it also exemplifies Beethoven the human being, that he never accepted the status quo and he always struggled. Let’s not forget that he was virtually penniless for most of his life and that he did what he believed in rather than what was expected, and for me this piece exemplifies the essence of his personality. He never loses contact with the idea that music is the expression in sound of human life, and human life can be shocking, and in this piece he shocks us, but also gives us moments of great tenderness and beauty.• The Proms begins on 17 July on Radio 3 and on the Proms website with a Beethoven weekend including great Proms performances of his music.

They achieved this despite most countries in the world suffering their worst economic contractions in decades. Some 24 of the family offices in the survey managed private fortunes of more than $3bn.Josef Stadler, head of UBS’s ultra-high net worth unit, said the world’s richest people had been able to increase their fortunes during the crisis because they had enough money to “embrace and manage risk like no other investor”.“They stick to their plans, even when market volatility makes it uncomfortable. They hold their position. They are disciplined,” Stadler said. “It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss.”The rising fortunes of the super-wealthy come as separate research shows that it is the poorest people in society who are mostly likely to be losing their jobs and suffering the biggest percentage fall in income.Ana Arendar, head of inequality campaigns at Oxfam, said: “Whilst those with great wealth are able to reallocate their investments to insulate themselves from the economic impacts of Covid-19, most poor people in developing and developed countries cannot take similar action to protect their limited wealth.“Wealth inequalities were already too high before the crisis and action is needed to ensure the gap does not grow further.”Family offices – which were pioneered by the Rockerfeller family in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations – are also used by wealthy people to run homes and staff across the world and to look after private jets, super-yachts and other accoutrements.The number of super-rich people continues to grow despite the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person and the founder of Amazon, has seen his fortune swell by $75bn so far this year to a record $189bn.More than 500,000 people in the world are classed as “ultra-wealthy”, with fortunes of more than $30m (£26.5m). That means there are more ultra-wealthy people than the populations of Iceland, Malta or Belize.This week, a group of more than 80 millionaires called on governments permanently to increase taxes on them and other members of the wealthy elite to help pay for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64853270418239725248e64d757ab564f4497d8/0_50_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e6f817deaebb90bc3d07aa622b7af","title":"is uk golden era relations china over podcast","story":"China and the UK have clashed in recent months over a draconian new security law in Hong Kong and the Chinese tech company Huawei. ’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Covid-19 cases had surged after the earlier easing of guidelines.“There’s a lot of places in the United States right now where there’s a lot of cases,” said McIlroy. “Whether this is the second wave or still part of the first wave … I think there’s no substitute for washing your hands and social distancing and making sure that you’re doing the right things.

His goal was to swim from Northern Ireland to Scotland through the channel, a treacherous 35km route known for big breakers, fierce storms and the lion’s-mane jellyfish, the marine dweller Argüelles fears the most.On that August morning in 2017, the weather finally cooperated after two weeks of waiting, and the sea was quiet until some last-minute drama. With a push at the halfway point, Argüelles was able to cross the channel and write his name into history as the oldest swimmer at the time to complete a series of challenging routes across the globe called the Oceans Seven (US swimmer Elizabeth Fry broke his age record in 2019). Now he has written about the milestone, and a lifetime of overcoming challenges, in his new book The Forever Swim.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 60-year-old is spending more time out of the water than he would like. A planned back-and-forth crossing of the English Channel in August is now uncertain.“I have to wait until further notice,” he says. “The English Channel back and forth will not be my last swim, but probably my last long swim.”Argüelles became enthralled with swimming in his youth after an unheralded countryman, Felipe ‘El Tibio’ Muñoz, won gold in the 200m breaststroke at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Argüelles trained with the aim of reaching similar heights but narrowly missed out on competing at the elite level.He went on to attend Stanford, hoping to swim for the university’s prestigious team, but ultimately the program was not a good fit. Yet he rediscovered the sport later in life and found that he liked the challenge of open water swimming. He completed endurance swimming’s Triple Crown – crossings of the Catalina Channel and the English Channel, and a circumnavigation of Manhattan. Then he learned about the Oceans Seven.All of the six previous finishers were under 40, whereas he was 56. Yet he was up for the itinerary: the English Channel, the Strait of Gibraltar, the Tsugaru Strait, the Ka’iwi Channel in Hawaii, the Catalina Channel in California, the Cook Strait of New Zealand and the North Channel.His swims ranged from what he described as an easy crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar to grueling ventures in the Tsugaru and Cook straits. Incredibly, the Tsugaru crossing lasted almost an entire day – 23 hours and 18 minutes, to be exact.“There was a lot of self-doubt in that swim,” Argüelles said. “I did not know if I was going to finish.” Yet he did, breaking his previous mark for longest swim, an 18-hour, 19-minute crossing of the English Channel.Argüelles returned to the UK for his final swim of the challenge.“It was the most difficult, the toughest, in the Oceans Seven,” Argüelles said.Unlike other crossings, such as Gibraltar and Ka’iwi, the North Channel features frigid temperatures. When Argüelles jumped in, the temperature hovered between 13C and 15C.“You can never get that coldness out of your body,” he said, “especially your arms, legs, hands and feet.”He prepared as best as he could. He trained in the similarly cold conditions of San Francisco Bay, then spent two weeks in Donaghadee, Northern Ireland, seeking a way to acclimate to the temperature while waiting for a day when the weather would accommodate a swim. He got to know a local swim club, the Chunky Dunkers, who go out for a plunge sans wetsuits every day of the year.The conditions nearly made it impossible to schedule a date, yet on the morning of 3 August Mother Nature gave Argüelles a chance to make the crossing. This might have been aided by a ceremony earlier that week, in which he brought water collected from both the Mexican and San Franciscan waters where he trains and deposited it into the channel.At the start of the swim, those forces treated him kindly. He had planned to reach the halfway point in six hours, but made it in five, to the delight of not only himself but also those in his escort boat, including trainer Nora Toledano and advisor Rafael Álvarez.Then the conditions worsened. Colliding currents threatened to push Argüelles back to Northern Ireland. He got a message from the boat to pick up the pace or risk losing his chance at the milestone.“They said, ‘You have to go sprint for the next hour,’” Argüelles recalls.He increased his strokes from 64 per minute to 67. He credited his extra physical effort to a mind-body aspect of his preparation.“One of the things I do in my training is a Qi Gong sequence,” Argüelles explains. “I have to try to do the sequence, move my legs, move my arms, lower back. The whole idea is to liberate your energy channels, create more energy.”Surpassing the currents, Argüelles was ready to complete the crossing to the Scottish coast, but there were some final obstacles.“Probably the scariest moment of all my swims in the Oceans Seven was at the end of the North Channel,” he said.In his book, he mentions that the lion’s-mane jellyfish were a no-show for much of the swim. Yet he told the  that they made a late, painful entrance.“They appeared at the very, very end,” he says. “I got stung just a little bit. It’s one of the risks. It hurt so much. The next day, I was in pain.”Meanwhile, Argüelles was scanning the coastline, as Oceans Seven rules mandate finishing on a beach. It wasn’t easy, with mammoth waves threatening to knock him unconscious onto a coast full of sharp rocks.“Suddenly, it was the worst-case scenario,” he recalls. “Another wave was coming, a big wave.”“I thought that if I hit my head on the rocks, if I was not dead, I could lose consciousness,” he says. “The boat would not come in enough time to get me.Since completing the Oceans Seven, Argüelles did an even longer swim – 24 hours and 14 minutes back and forth in a return to Catalina. He experienced a different kind of milestone when he became a grandfather last September. He plans to share his real-life adventure stories with his granddaughter.“I always thought I wanted to tell my grandchildren stories,” Argüelles says, “about those things I really did. They’re better than just imaginary stories. I swam with dolphins, with whales.”As he noted, “there’s always time to go for a swim, a beautiful swim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9cae18939e04107e28cb22dd7512ec89903c4a/0_116_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d82b6a84b015feebd3553e4b5b6d1e2","title":"from family holidays to suburban commutes why a hybrid suv makes sense","story":"SUVs don’t have to be the imposing gas-guzzlers we often think of them as. For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f79da44d8a0ece6279b5b367a3c891969238286/0_27_5641_3384/master/5641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b40ded8ed46288a9e99afe1d7162254","title":"10 of the uks best hidden destinations readers travel tips","story":"From Scotland’s most easterly Munro mountain to a remote ‘Greek’ beach in Devon, readers nobly share their knowledge of lovely, but little-visited spotsPenmon is a quiet village on the south-east tip of Anglesey, on the coastal footpath and cycling routes, near a wide sandy beach. Penmon Priory with its 400-year-old domed dovecote and St Seiriol’s Well are on the way to the point. Here there is a lighthouse and cafe and beautiful views of Puffin Island and the Snowdonia mountains across the strait. A woodland walk leads to a hidden castle. This hidden gem is just four miles from Beaumaris with its castle, shops, cafes, restaurants and boat trips. SusannaThe Teesdale Way is one of England’s quieter long-distance paths. Largely following the banks of the River Tees, it starts from the remote moorlands of Cumbria and runs down past forests and waterfalls in Durham to the industrial landscapes of Teesside and the North Yorkshire coast. I recently ran a 10km section of the trail and saw only two other souls, along with fantastic views and wild deer. There are lots of options for camping, glamping and B\u0026ampBs along the way, including pleasant towns and villages such Yarm, Middleton in Teesdale and the now-infamous Barnard Castle.

My favourite section is that nearing its western end at Crinan itself, a small village with a tea shopgallery and hotel. You can walk or cycle along the towpath (experiencing the weirdness of a canal running above sea level), watch yachts coming through the locks, head up into the forests and maybe see the reintroduced beavers at Loch Barnluasgan, or just relax and enjoy the views out towards Jura and Mull. It’s a special place, where taking things slowly comes easily.MaryHikers intent on climbing Scotland’s most easterly munro, Mount Keen, above Glen Esk, all miss out on a far quieter beauty spot nearby. A circuitous route around Loch Lee and the smaller summit of Cairn Lick is a far more rewarding walk. The walk takes in the length of the loch, passes by the beautiful Falls of Unich (pictured) and climbs up an impressive gully. On the descent you get views to one side of a lochan hidden from those at ground level and, looking forward, a sweeping vista of Loch Lee stretches down the glen. An inviting prospect for a cool down dip on a hot summer’s day. All this and rarely anyone else to share it with.DebbieDavid Balfour’s Bay is a remote and breathtaking sandy bay with clear turquoise waters and pristine white sands in a stunning setting – the tidal Isle of Erraid, near Mull on Scotland’s Atlantic Coast. On a clear day, you could imagine you were in Barbados. To reach the bay, walk across Erraid from Knockvologan Beach at low tide. This scenic walk can be extended to explore the north side of Erraid where there are magnificent views of the Sound of Iona. Just be careful of tides so you don’t get caught there – a swim back would be invigorating!Peter RileyDewstow Gardens in Monmouthshire were only rediscovered in 2000 after being buried in tonnes of soil after the second world war and make a stunning place to visit for an afternoon. There are little nooks everywhere – ponds, rockeries, grottoes. It reminds me of The Secret Garden. There are a few great hotels near it also if you want to make a weekend of it.• Reopened last weekend, takeaway refreshments only, adult £7.50, 6-10s £2.50, 11-18s £4.50, under-5s free, family £24Joanne SkidmoreThe Rhinog hills east of Harlech are wild, heather- and wood-covered beauties that, from the north, offer stunning views across Cardigan bay, and fabulous walking. They feel remote in that you might only meet feral goats on your path, but within minutes you can drop down to the coast, for example, to the morfa (marsh) and beach at Harlech or Shell Island, or to the pretty stone-hewn Ty-Mawr pubhotel in Llanbedr. We stayed in the Laundry Cottage in Dyffryn Ardudwy close to the Cwm Nantcol campsite.RuthDon’t go to the castle in Falmouth, lovely as it is. Instead, park in the Pendennis Head car park (no charge), then follow the footpath down to the east and eventually you’ll access the hidden coves reached off the coast path. With a bit of luck you’ll have a cove to yourself, although you might have to share with a grey seal or two. Then the scene is set for sunbathing, swimming, rockpooling and snorkelling. Remember to check the tide times, and keep on eye on the incoming water … Otherwise this is the perfect spot for relaxation.JaneKnown as Devon’s Greek beach, Broadsands beach in Ilfracombe is a pretty cove reached down over 300 steep steps that help keep the crowds away even on a warm summer weekend. The hidden beach is backed by cliffs and is best at low tide, with great views towards Combe Martin Bay. To get there, find the coast path behind the Sandy Cove hotel and look out for a wooden signpost among the trees to your right. For a good view of the beach, stay on the coast path a little further until you reach a caravan park and a well-positioned bench with a stunning view from above.Sidra Nawaz This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

In the past 24 hours, there have been 140 new coronavirus-related deaths.These grim records come as Los Angeles and San Diego school districts, two of the state’s largest, made the decision to go online-only through the fall, and the virus ripped through California’s prison system, prompting the state to release up to 8,000 prisoners in an effort to curb the spread.On Monday Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, ordered all bars to shut and all restaurants, movie theaters and museums to halt indoor operations. “It’s incumbent on all of us to recognize, soberly, that Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon,” he said in his press briefing.“We were able to suppress the spread of this virus. We were able to knock down the growth of this at the beginning. We’re going to do that again,” Newsom said. “There’s no doubt in my mind.”Case numbers continue to climb around the US, which has so far recorded more than 3.4m cases and more than 137,000 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins.

Infighting between the progressive wing of the party and the establishment wing has been relatively minimal, as they come together to focus on Biden’s campaign to push Trump out of the White House.Some top party officials are feeling ambitious, and want to ride another potential “blue wave” to try to win races that are usually out of reach in states like Georgia and Ohio. But there’s a strain of caution running through the Democratic party as well. Things looked great for them for a while in 2016, too, but Republicans ended up with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and the memory of that cataclysmic loss is still fresh.“I mean, we are emotionally and mentally scarred in such a way that we are not going to feel comfortable until a week after Biden is sworn in,” said the Democratic strategist Tom Bowen.In any election cycle, campaign officials use cautious phrases like “we’re not leaving anything to chance” or “campaigning like we’re 10 points down until election day” – and the 2020 presidential race is no different. But coupled with that is an argument that Trump’s case for re-election is not reaching the voters he needs to.The memo went on to tick off the problems with each of Trump’s arguments.On Tuesday, in another sign that Democrats see a rare opening to compete in what are usually Republican strongholds, the Biden campaign began airing a 60-second general election ad in Texas, fueled by a six-figure ad buy. That ad is the first in a $15m multi-state blitz in six battleground states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Meanwhile, the pro-Trump America First Action Super Pac is pouring $23m into Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin but not Michigan – a state that Trump needs to win re-election. Trump himself has been campaigning over the last few months in reliably red states. Private polling for Republicans also shows the president in trouble in what are usually reliably conservative states.All of which suggests Democrats have the upper hand over Republicans. But Democratic state officials and operatives expect polls to tighten and the summer high to end. In multiple interviews, these officials were hopeful but also realistic that the next few months won’t be easy.Democrats often cite 2016, where polls showed Hillary Clinton as the clear favorite to win the presidency. At that time, and again now, some Democrats also felt retaking control of the Senate was possible.“I’m not going to argue that there isn’t some anxiety there, and I think that 2016 put that in our being because we were feeling very secure that we would have a Democratic president, and things changed so rapidly,” said the Kansas Democratic party chairwoman, Vicki Hiatt.Democrats are hoping to win a US Senate seat in Kansas this cycle, which would usually be unheard of. “I think over the past three and a half years we’ve seen some very unpredictable things happen that we would never have expected. I think that is where that anxiety comes from. For me personally, I’m not going to rest until we have this thing done. I’m cautiously optimistic but I’m not taking anything for granted.”From September, Biden and Trump will face each other in three televised debates, something Republican campaign officials hope the president will be able to dominate. Democrats are also expecting some kind of “October surprise” from the Trump campaign and a barrage of warnings about Democratic control of the White House and Congress.“That tightening will happen. It’s natural. So what we need to be doing is building up our reserves now,” said the Maryland Democratic party chairwoman, Yvette Lewis. “So we can’t waste time right now worrying about the what-ifs.”The Tennessee Democratic party chairwoman, Mary Mancini, said that Republicans have not yet thrown their full offensive force against Democratic candidates this cycle.“Now what they could do and what they’re trying to do is fearmonger their way into winning,” Mancini said. “I think the most damaging and frightening thing is we have yet to see the all-out assault from the Republican party in terms of using fear to motivate voters. We’ve seen a little of it but it’s the tip of the iceberg for the Republican party.”The pandemic has also changed the reality of campaigning for office. More voters will be voting by mail rather than in person, potentially delaying the final results on election night. Trump has argued, contrary to established evidence, that voting by mail is vulnerable to fraud.“I think my greatest fear is what the Republicans do now and over the next few months to delegitimise the election,” said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio Democrats’ state house campaign arm.Julian Mulvey, a veteran Democratic ad maker, added: “Every Democrat should be worried. Every Democrat should be nervous because it won’t be over till it’s over. But I think everyone is nervously optimistic right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09dd309b51c58897a9542bf055084b36714f7cd1/0_531_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fc03d3a7d9ea158f2b56fbc3841b8b7a","title":"matt hancock rules out mandatory face masks offices health secretary england","story":"Health secretary says new rules for shops in England will not be extended to officesThe UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has categorically ruled out requiring people to wear face masks in offices, as he hit back at accusations that the new rules stipulating they must be used by shoppers in England were mired in confusion.People face fines of up to £100 if they do not wear face coverings in shops under rules that come into effect from 24 July, which are designed to reassure visitors to the high street amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The move, announced by Hancock in the Commons on Tuesday, came after Labour claimed ministers were in a “complete muddle” over the plans, with Michael Gove saying days earlier that face coverings would not be mandatory in shops.Hancock also sought to play down suggestions that his cabinet colleagues Gove and Liz Truss had sown confusion after they were pictured separately on Tuesday leaving a branch of Pret a Manger, with only the latter wearing a face covering.On Wednesday, the  reported face coverings could soon be recommended in all public places including offices and other workplaces, with officials beginning private talks with groups representing major employers.It came after rules including the requirement that face coverings must be worn in enclosed public spaces such as workplaces were announced in the Blackburn with Darwen area to avoid a Leicester-style lockdown.However, referencing the ’s report and asked whether office workers would have to wear masks when they return to work, Hancock told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday: “No, that isn’t going to happen, and the reason is that in offices you tend to spend a lot of time with the same people, and so the way to stop the spread of the virus in offices is to have social distancing, either 2 metres or 1 metre plus mitigations in place.“The same is true in classrooms, by the way, where if you’re in a classroom, if you’re in a space with the same people repeatedly and for long periods of time, whether an office or a classroom, then a mask doesn’t actually protect them.“Where the masks benefits is from you spreading the disease to other people when you have relatively short interactions with lots of different people, which is why it’s right to have this as mandatory on public transport, in shops and in the NHS but not in offices where you’re basically there with the same group of people for long periods of time, or in classrooms where the same applies. So it’s following the scientific advice.”In an interview with Sky News, Hancock added: “We will not be recommending people wear masks in the office.”Asked about the pictures that emerged on Tuesday showing Gove and Truss apparently conveying a confused message with only the latter wearing a mask leaving a Pret a Manger outlet, Hancock added: “This picture was before we had announced the change in the policy. I announced that change in the policy in the House of Commons yesterday.”Asked who would be right in wearing a face mask in that store, Hancock said: “Well, the advice until 24 July, giving businesses time to make sure that they can get their processes in place and make sure that we can implement this smoothly, the advice now is that face coverings are recommended in shops but not mandatory, that’s been the position for some time and we’re tightening that up to say that they are mandatory from the 24 July.”Asked explicitly if from 24 July somebody would have to wear a face mask coming out of Pret, Hancock said: “You do need to wear a face mask in Pret because Pret is a shop … in hospitality, so in a restaurant, there needs to be table service. If there’s table service then it’s not necessary to have a mask but in any shop you do need the mask.“So if you’re going up to the counter in Pret to buy takeaway, that is a shop, that is Pret operating as a shop. But if you go to your local pub, you can’t go to the pub – in fact, there have been stories of people stopping people going to the bar – you can’t go to the bar, and the reason there is the risk of transmission over the bar and therefore it’s table service and a mask is not needed.”Meanwhile, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to set out the next steps for the lockdown in a press conference on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0058140ca263d1fe48fab08d46f5195801b2d9c/0_151_4598_2758/master/4598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491b628a12ce0a33dfa3547df5a6d207","title":"the day bristol woke up to a new statue","story":"City responds to guerrilla installation of sculpture inspired by the day the Colston statue fellWhen Bristol went to bed on Tuesday night, the question was theoretical: what should replace the toppled statue of the slave trader Edward Colston?When it woke up, the answer was concrete – or, at least, resin and steel. Just before 5am, a team directed by the artist Marc Quinn had swiftly and almost silently installed a sculpture of a Black Lives Matter activist, Jen Reid, and driven away.Shortly after the vehicles left, a gaggle of photographers surrounded Reid, who stood with her fist in the air, echoing the picture from the day Colston fell that had inspired the piece.“It’s just incredible,” she said of the artwork that felt like an ambush. “That’s pretty fucking ballsy, that it is.”But in offering an answer to one problem, Quinn and Reid presented Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, with another one. The installation of the new statue, unsanctioned by the council, was not how the Colston conundrum was supposed to be resolved, Rees told the local community radio station BCfm a couple of hours later.“The subject matter is powerful, a local voice, a remarkable woman being represented,” he said. “All that is fantastic. But Bristol is a very delicately balanced city. A fractured city. So the process is really important, and this hasn’t really worked with the process.”Despite Rees’s reservations, the statue of Reid – titled “A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020” – now had the same advantage that the Colston one had held for more than a century: it was there.“It almost feels like it’s been there forever,” said Quinn. “It gets under the skin before you understand what it is.”And, as the Colston case proved, the criteria for taking down a public sculpture turn out to be very different to those for putting it up.Reid, a Bristolian, said it had been difficult to keep the secret from friends and family. “When friends say ‘I’ll see you later’, I think … yeah, you will!”Her daughter Leila, Gazing up at her mother’s avatar a little later, shook her head and laughed. “It is incredible seeing it,” she said. “It’s surreal. From the kneecap to the shape of her hands - it’s just her.”She said the statue was the right answer to the Colston problem, at least for now. “She’s proud to represent a movement, and if there’s a better way to do that, I can’t think of it.”The police quickly concluded that no crime had been committed and the statue’s future was a matter for the council. The only official figure in sight was the driver of a road sweeper, who stopped to take a picture before continuing with his shift. Meanwhile, double-taking passersby and those who had heard the news stopped and stared throughout the day.“It’s beautiful, and it’s really powerful,” said Shani Ackford, a speech therapist, who had come to see it with her young son. “It’s the right thing to represent how it came down.”Sanna Bertilsson stopped on her bike to get a picture “before they take it down”.Others were much less convinced, voicing concerns that a work by an established white artist had occupied a space created by black activism. Rees noted that Quinn was a “London-based artist”.Quinn said it was Reid who had “created the sculpture when she stood on the plinth and raised her arm in the air”, and that his role had simply been to “crystallise it”.Thomas J Price, who has been commissioned to create a sculpture dedicated to the Windrush generation, said he understood the “initial positive reactions” but called it a “votive statue to appropriation”.Reid, for her part, took the opposite view, though she also expressed her sympathy for Rees. “It’s a demonstrable commitment to the cause of Black Lives Matter in that it shows active allyship,” she said. “Isn’t this what we need? Allies?”Whatever the answer to that question, the council had a more immediate concern about safety. It sent a structural engineer to assess the installation, and was waiting for their report on Wednesday evening.Quinn and his team said they had gone through exactly the same safety assessment that they would have done on a commissioned piece. The artist said it was “not a permanent artwork”, but it had been placed in such a way that it would be “extremely difficult to move”.All the same, by the afternoon Rees had declared that the statue “will have to be removed”.In the long term, the decision on Colston’s successor will reflect the conclusions of a specially appointed history commission – and, Rees was at pains to say, aim to accommodate even the “people do not get what they want”, so that they know “they live in a city that is their one and respects them.”But Quinn argued that there was scope for a more urgent statement, too. “There are different speeds for different kinds of response,” he said. “If I’m in a position to put something like this up quickly, while the conversation is happening, there’s a duty to do it.”By the end of the day, it seemed that the statue was going nowhere just yet.As to what kind of question Bristol will wake up to on Thursday, no one could say. “Once you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more,” Quinn said. “I would encourage all artists to take the public realm into their hands, and do things to activate it. We put it there, and now it has its own life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868e6357cba7478d81767fe14e501467a97a3281/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953c424f82cdd9569fcbdd3aa47b8b40","title":"angela merkel set for central role in talks on eu recovery plan","story":"Germany has foot in both camps as leaders try to agree on rescue package and seven-year budgetWhen Angela Merkel attended her first EU summit as Germany’s chancellor, in 2005, she joined Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and leaders from central and eastern Europe that had joined the bloc only 17 months earlier. Nearly 15 years later, Merkel is the EU’s longest-serving leader and seen as the key to unlocking a deal to help Europe face the worst economic slump forecast in its history.When EU leaders sit down together on Friday and Saturday, it will be their first face-to-face meeting since the pandemic struck. On the table is a €750bn (£680bn) draft recovery plan, as well as a proposed €1.074tn EU budget for the next seven years. Getting a deal on the budget will be fiendishly difficult as the EU attempts to square the circle of more spending on the environment, security and health and the €75bn shortfall caused by Brexit.Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said Merkel would play a crucial role both because she was “so respected for her work” and because Germany was taking a middle position in the recovery plan, giving it a foot in both camps.She said Germany had “a very strong commitment … to really invest heavily in the recovery of the EU,” but demands from northern countries to link funds to economic reform were “something that is very close to the German heart as well”.Optimistic officials are encouraged by the coincidence that Germany took on the EU council’s rotating presidency on 1 July, amid sniping about the performance of the leaders of EU institutions. Charles Michel, the European council president, tasked with brokering a compromise, has been criticised by some for his handling of budget talks. “He is still paralysed by the failure of the European council in February,” said one senior EU diplomat.An EU official responded that Michel had fully prepared for that February summit, but the task had not been easy as some EU leader were unprepared to compromise. “Since then we have had a global pandemic landing on our doorstep and the world has changed completely.”Germany opened the way to a recovery plan with its own political conversion, enshrined in the deal Merkel struck with France’s Emmanuel Macron for a fund based on grants to countries hardest hit by coronavirus. Pierre Sellal, who spent a decade as France’s most senior diplomat in Brussels, said Merkel had crossed two of Germany’s traditional red lines “The first, no deficits, no common borrowing. And secondly, no transformation of the rules underpinning in the single currency, no budgetary transfers.”The Germany presidency could crystallise a consensus, he said. “Now we are at a very particular moment, the stakes are very high.”Germany’s readiness to accept large-scale EU borrowing contrasts with the stance Merkel took during the eurozone debt crisis, when she stood firmly against a transfer union. The German government “realised that its own approach doesn’t allow the necessary convergence and cohesion in the EU,” said Schwarzer, who highlighted the role of Germany’s Social Democrat finance minister, Olaf Scholz, as architect of the policy shift. Schwarzer said Germany’s change of heart was “not out of some kind of abstract idea of solidarity – but it’s really in Germany’s self-interest to do so.”Since Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US – two hammer blows to the European project – all EU leaders have become more aware of their economic interdependence and the risks of the European single market unravelling. “Thanks to Brexit … suddenly the leaders say we will defend the single market,” said a second senior EU diplomat, who also cited Trump and tensions in the EU-China relationship. As political frost descends on global trade, what was once seen as Germany’s strength, its export-led economy, suddenly looked more like a vulnerability.Merkel’s change of heart has weakened the “frugal four”, a quartet of northern European states that want less EU spending and more budget discipline. For months, Germany had been perceived as an unofficial member. Now they stand more isolated.But EU officials caution that Germany’s policy shift is not enough for agreement, as the frugal four continue to insist on tough conditions for loans that southern European governments reject as unacceptable. “Even having the Franco-German proposal is not always helpful, said one official. “We are playing chess on many different levels.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, shop steward of the frugal four, said on Tuesday he was “not hopeful” of a deal.The other big obstacle comes from the leader second only to Merkel in years running his country: Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s prime minister is resisting plans to tie the disbursement of EU funds to the rule of law, a key demand for western European governments alarmed about the weakening of democratic checks and balances in Hungary. Orbán got a symbolic boost from lawmakers in his Fidesz party this week who passed a resolution declaring that EU funds should not be linked to “political or ideological conditions – under the label of rule of law”.Solving this political Rubik’s cube is now bound up with the political legacy of the German chancellor, who told MEPs this month: “The top priority in the Germany presidency will be unity in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/097a85a66960898b0a6617e622572a8d8f785ac3/7_0_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=22702141c2d95b08f25b9953b191c031","title":"black lives matter sculpture of jen reid removed colston  bristol","story":"The sculpture of protester has been taken to a museum for artist Marc Quinn to collect, says Bristol city councilThe sculpture of a Black Lives Matter protester that replaced a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol has been removed just 24 hours after it went up.Contractors were pictured using ropes and a crane to secure the statue of Jen Reid, who had been photographed standing on the plinth with a raised fist on the day the figure of Colston was removed, at about 5.20am on Thursday morning.A witness said that the workmen carefully secured the strap before moving the Marc Quinn sculpture, with one saying “don’t break her dress”. It was then lifted into a recycling and skip hire lorry and driven away.A Bristol city council spokeswoman said: “This morning we removed the sculpture. It will be held at our museum for the artist to collect or donate to our collection.”BBC Bristol reported that Quinn would be charged with the cost of the removal and that the council said it had received complaints of fly-tipping.Reid and Quinn have said that any proceeds from the sale of the work will go to two charities chosen by Reid that are devoted to improving the teaching of black history in British schools.The black resin and steel statue, entitled A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, was put up without the council’s knowledge shortly before 5am on Wednesday by a team under the direction of Quinn. He had said it was not intended to be in place permanently.Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the city was going through an “incredibly delicate time”.“This is not about taking down a statue of Jen, who is a very impressive woman,” Rees said.“This is about taking down a statue of a London-based artist who came and put it up without permission.”Rees said when he spoke to Quinn, the artist was unaware that the toppling of the Colston statue had also caused damage to the grave of Scipio Africanus - a memorial to an enslaved African man.“If you’re going to do something, you need to do it with awareness and a full knowledge of the context in which you’re doing it,” Rees said.The statue of Colston had stood for more than a century, prompting some social media users to say that the council should have allowed the statue of Reid to remain in place for longer before bringing it down.Tim Burns, a charity worker, said: “Some days I wake up a feel proud to live in Bristol. Other days I feel like we missed the point? The Jen Reid statue didn’t need to be permanent but after procrastinating for years over whether to take down Colston removing this after 24 hours feels unnecessary.”The author Bernadine Evaristo tweeted: “Now it has to find a public spot. If Bristol doesn’t have the guts, I nominate Brixton.”Police said on Thursday that no offence had been committed and the statue’s future was a matter for the council. Most passersby in Bristol appeared to approve of the addition to the plinth, with many taking selfies raising a fist in front of it.There was some tension last night when a group arrived to say the statue should come down, prompting others on the scene to take a knee.Before the statue came down, Reid and Quinn both said that they viewed its future as being a matter for others to decide. “Whether it’s there for a day or a week or a month, it’s been there,” Reid said.Quinn said that “once you make an artwork, you have no control over it anymore”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7116b4330ed16d880f6d3c27e84fd12ea035e825/0_216_5529_3318/master/5529.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=02dde9acf189d2a74ef80f09dc52a81d","title":"russia launches pollution investigation after streams run orange","story":"Acidic runoff from abandoned Urals mine puts spotlight on hazardous industrial wasteRussian prosecutors are inspecting a facility supposed to treat acid runoff from an abandoned Urals mine after videos emerged of streams running orange.Drone footage uploaded last week by an Instagram travel blogger showed a bright-orange landscape near the disused copper-sulphide mine close to the village of Lyovikha.“The Nizhny Tagil district prosecutors office has begun to check the facility treating the waste waters from Levikhinsky mine,” a spokeswoman, Marina Kanatova, told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday.The mine “is flooded and now acid rivers flow from it, poisoning everything they touch”, the blogger zamkad_life wrote to describe the series of images which have since gone viral. Videos on his account show the orange-coloured streams fanning out over the forested landscape.The prosecutors’ spokeswoman said specialists would “take samples to establish whether the treatment of the acidic water from the mine complies with the rules”.The environmentalist Andrei Volegov, who chairs a local non-governmental organisation, Ecopravo, said on Facebook that the polluted water was supposed to be neutralised in a technical “pond” which overflowed during heavy rains.Volegov alerted prosecutors to the situation last year and received a reply that the company in charge of the pollutants was not properly funded and could not buy enough lime to neutralise the acid, according to a letter he published.According to local media, the Sverdlovsk regional government asked for the mine to be sealed but Moscow refused on the grounds that there were still valuable resources there.A major spill of fuel oil in the Arctic last month raised the profile of industrial pollution in Russia, where companies are often punished with only small fines and hazardous waste can be left unaddressed for years due to bureaucracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b050cf6b6db3e1bcb8cb2866e77063b6f44bfb3a/0_0_4146_2810/master/4146.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc1e96b2c79fd3fc50a2547820c93771 700w","title":"coronavirus live news fauci says us must stop nonsense south africa cases top 300000","story":"If Tokyo Games don’t go ahead, Beijing 2022 also likely to be cancelled Dr Fauci predicts US will meet vaccine target Bolsonaro tests positive againFor everything you could possibly want to know about the status of the race to find a vaccine, I can highly recommend the New York Times’ Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.

Rents have continued to climb across England, but they are sliding in London as Airbnb owners abandon hopes of attracting holidaymakers and put their properties on the long-term rental market.These are strange times for this year’s cohort of UK A-level students. Schools and colleges closed in March exams were cancelled. Sectors young people would normally seek casual employment in, such as retail or hospitality, have been shedding staff at an alarming rate. Many universities, including Cambridge, are moving to online tuition. Apprenticeship opportunities have largely evaporated. For school leavers, this is a crucial time: deciding whether to travel, work or go to university. The pace of change at the age of 17 or 18 is the equivalent to years as an adult. But now, with plans shattered, these young people are facing a year in limbo.More than three-quarters of the world’s richest people have reported an increase in their already vast family fortunes, despite the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Research into the family offices of the super-rich found that the vast majority were able to “ride out 2020’s storm in financial markets”, while many less wealthy people have lost their jobs and seen the value of their savings and pensions collapse.Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 534 to 200,260, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Thursday.The reported death toll rose by seven to 9,078, the tally showed.As always, it would be great to hear from you.

He is one of more than a dozen people detained by authorities in recent days over allegations that clinics in Uttara and Mirpur issued fake certificates to patients saying they were virus-free without testing them.Experts say false documents have worsened the already dire virus situation in the country of 168 million people by casting doubt on the veracity of certificates issued by clinics.Bangladesh has reported just over 193,000 infections and 2,457 deaths so far but the real figures are likely much higher because little testing has been carried out.Tokyo is likely to see coronavirus cases exceed 280 on Thursday – a daily record for the Japanese capital – according to the governor, Yuriko Koike. “It’s still incomplete, but I’m hearing that the number will be above 280,” Koike told reporters. She noted that the city, home to almost 14 million people, was due to conduct more than 4,000 tests on Thursday, as the city steps up testing amid a surge in cases since the nationwide state of emergency was lifted in late May.Officials have traced several clusters to nighttime entertainment districts, with testing now focusing on employees and customers at host and hostess clubs, where social distancing is difficult. There was anger this week after reports that 37 cases had been traced to a theatre that hosted a stage production by boy bands, whose members later greeted fans. Some reports said the theatre had not properly followed industry rules on social distancing and mask wearing. More than 850 people who attended the event over six days have been urged to get tested.

If we hadn’t done that the economy would have been in a far worse position.It is going to be very, very difficult for lots of people and we are going to do everything we can to support them and keep businesses going through this very difficult period.Around 500 jobs are being cut at luxury fashion firm Burberry in the UK and globally as it axes office space and makes cuts across stores outside Britain after lockdown sent sales tumbling.The firm said around 150 office jobs were expected to go in the UK, where it is headquartered, and a further 350 overseas as it looks to slash annual costs by a further £55m. This comes on top of the previously announced £140m cost savings.London was among the cities particularly badly impacted, as the firm makes much of its sales in the capital from tourist trade, which was been decimated by the grounding of planes during lockdowns.Marco Gobbetti, the chief executive of Burberry, said: Sales were severely impacted by the drop in luxury demand from Covid-19 and we expect it will take time to return to pre-crisis levels with the resumption of overseas travel.As we enter the second phase of our strategy, we are sharpening our focus on product and making other organisational changes to increase our agility and generate structural savings that we will be able to reinvest into consumer-facing activities to further strengthen our luxury positioning.In retail, tourist flows are likely to remain negligible, and store operations are continuing to face significant headwinds, with some remaining closed and operating with reduced trading hours.It said trading in the second half will “largely depend on the actions governments pursue to control the spread of the virus as economies restart”, including the potential for a second peak of the pandemic and additional lockdowns.Here is the ’s economics correspondent Richard Partington’s piece on the ONS figures.The figures reveal that the number of hours worked in the UK plummeted between March and May at a record pace, the steepest drop since records began in 1971.The England cricketer Jofra Archer has been dropped from playing the second test against the West Indies for breaking Covid-19 rules.

More on this story to follow:Continued lockdown in Leicester is no longer justified, the city’s mayor has said as the government prepares to decide whether to make changes to the restrictions.Sir Peter Soulsby claimed the government had got Leicester into a “messy situation” by its handling of the local lockdown.He said government data had “finally” told city officials which areas of Leicester were worst affected by coronavirus.If only we’d had this information in advance, we’d have been able to do what they’re now doing in Blackburn, which is actually working closely with the communities and avoiding having to be locked down.I very much regret the fact that the government didn’t trust us with this data earlier but I think now we’ve got it, we are the ones well-placed here in the city to make sure that we use it effectively.Speaking to Sky News, he criticised what he described as the government’s “blanket political-led lockdown” of the whole of the city, and said he was angry and frustrated.Some streets have no issue at all and in other streets nearby you’ve got a major issue, and we needed to know that at the time so we could intervene with pinpoint accuracy.Further advice needs to be given, support needs to be given, and we needed to know where that advice and support was needed.Asked when he expected to learn whether the local lockdown was being lifted, he added: The secretary of state is due to make an announcement this afternoon. I expect to hear when the rest of the city, and indeed the rest of the country hears - because frankly we have not been involved in any of the decision-making about this.We have been told what the political decisions will be, and we will be told again what the political decision will be - whether or not we come out of it.Asked what he hoped the health and social care secretary Matt Hancock would say, Soulsby went on: I hope he’ll recognise that as a result of what we are already doing here in the city, we are dramatically driving down the transmission of the virus.Asked what his reaction would be if the government announced a further two-week lockdown, the city’s mayor said: I think if we are told that, there are going to be an awful lot of Leicester people who are very angry indeed.It was quite clear that it was a political decision taken without the advice of Public Health England to take us into this lockdown in the first place.It’ll be a political decision to let us out and the sooner that political decision is taken, the better.The ONS figures show that vacancies fell 463,000 between March and May to a record low of 333,000 as companies froze hiring in the face of the coronavirus crisis.The pace of job cut announcements has also showed no sign of slowing down in recent weeks, with some 75,000 job losses announced last month alone, according to recent analysis by the PA Media news agency.This points to further grim jobless figures in the months to come.Jonathan Athow, the ONS’s deputy national statistician, said: Pay is now falling on most measures, with many furloughed workers not having their wages topped up by their employers.Matthew Percival, director for people and skills at the CBI business group, told PA: These figures show serious difficulties for hundreds of thousands of people, but unfortunately this is still only the beginning of the impact on the labour market.Flattening the unemployment curve will remain paramount.The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has said the latest unemployment figures from the ONS underlined the need for continuing government support to those sectors particularly hard hit by the coronavirus crisis.“Clearly there are some trends that can be discerned - the number of hours worked going down and the amount of economic inactivity going up as well,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.I think this is a very concerning time because we could see that being worsened by changes going ahead with the furlough scheme.We do think that for particularly badly affected sectors there does need to be continuing support, otherwise we will see extra waves of people potentially moving into unemployment or economic inactivity.As we’ve reported earlier, this suggests the number of UK workers on company payrolls has fallen during lockdown by nearly two-thirds of a million as the coronavirus crisis claimed another 74,000 jobs last month.The ONS said the pace of job losses appeared to have slowed in June, with claims under Universal Credit by the unemployed and those on low incomes falling by 28,100 between May and June to 2.6 million.With 9.4 million people on furlough classed as employed, the true impact is expected to only be shown after the current support scheme ends in October.The ONS figures suggest the increase in job losses were not as bad as many feared, partly due to large numbers of businesses placing employees on furlough. This suggests the full impact of the pandemic on jobs won’t be known until the furlough scheme ends in October.But the early estimates show 649,000 fewer people in employment in June compared with March.ONS analysis suggests around half a million employees who said they were temporarily away from their jobs due to the pandemic were receiving no pay.ONS analysis also found that pay is now growing at a slower rate than inflation, especially in sectors where furloughing is more prominent.Good morning! I’m Lucy Campbell, here to take you through the latest developments in UK politics and the coronavirus outbreak as the morning unfolds.The number of UK workers on payrolls fell by 649,000 between March and June as the coronavirus crisis claimed another 74,000 jobs last month, according to the Office for National Statistics.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.There are now far more out-of-work people who are not looking for a job than before the pandemic.If you would like to get in touch to share a news tip or suggestion, please feel free to get in touch with me as I work."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Video: RTE\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPlans to reopen pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs has been postponed until August 10th. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed. Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.And, in a further precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease, the Government has extended the mandatory wearing of face coverings to shops, shopping centres and retail workers where there is no protective screen or a two-metre distance between them and their customers.The rise in the number of infections from “unrestricted house parties” has led the Government to recommend social visits to other people’s homes be limited to 10 visitors from no more than four households.The advice against unnecessary travel overseas has been extended but the Government still plans to publish a “green list” of countries with similar levels of infection rates that people can travel to, though it is maintaining advice against non-essential foreign travel. Reproduction numberTaoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government was not proceeding with the fourth reopening phase as the reproduction number of the virus, a key metric tracked to assess the rate of infection, had risen above one, meaning it was spreading in the community.Mr Martin said the virus had not changed and “remains as indiscriminate in its cruelty as it has since it arrived, and it remains as relentless as ever in its effort to find new hosts”.Getting the “R number” back below one would give the Government the best possible chance to reopen schools in late August and to resume essential healthcare, he said. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) was “worried about the trajectory” of the virus, Mr Martin said, and if it continued to spread at the current rate, it could jeopardise plans to reopen schools. The Taoiseach also said there needed to be “better follow-up” to ensure visitors arriving into the country were complying with the 14-day self-isolating period. He promised an increased presence of compliance staff and communications at ports and airports and more extensive tracing.The State’s acting chief medical officer, Dr Ronan Glynn, said the 14-day incidence rate of the disease had risen from a low of 2.5 cases per 100,000 people to 3.9 cases per 100,000 on Wednesday.“This virus is extremely infectious. It wants to spread but it wants people to come in contact with each other to do so,” he said. Dr Glynn said the R number was between 1.2 and 1.8, which means that for every five infected people, the disease will spread to between six and nine other people. He said there had been large clusters linked to private homes, in some cases infecting 40-50 people.The pause in lifting of restrictions marks the first time public officials have delayed reopening since the country first started to emerge from lockdown in May.Covid-19 figuresThe NPHET reported another two coronavirus-related deaths and 14 new confirmed cases, bringing to 145 cases over the past seven days. And the number of clusters – defined as two cases or more – in private homes increased by 96 in the week to last Sunday, according to figures from the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. Representatives of the pub trade reacted angrily to the Government’s decision describing the delay in the reopening of about 3,500 pubs as a “hammer blow” to the industry.Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland, said rural family-run pubs would bear the brunt of the decision. And Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association, said it was a “crushing blow” for pubs which will be unable to trade for 40 per cent of the year.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hotels federation says decision to pause lifting of lockdown will put jobs at riskFather of three won an All-Ireland medal with Cork when they beat Down in 2010Face coverings to become mandatory in shops and shopping centresQuantum computers could perform billions of times faster than current supercomputerThose who have recovered from coronavirus \u0026lsquounlikely\u0026rsquo to see impact on premiums or coverSwan owner Ronan Lynch brands decision to push back opening three weeks \u0026lsquoa disgrace\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader will seek to promote \u0026lsquopractical\u0026rsquo co-operation during delayed visitSector now \u0026lsquooverlooked\u0026rsquo as driving lessons brought foward in reopening planProcess to deal with claims cannot be established until new members chosenF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland director does not want tourists at his hotel who have not quarantinedThat\u0026rsquos Maths: Influential Hungarian took up position in Dias in 1954New strategy: Students able to select further-education courses alongside CAO picksUK government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound2bn insufficient in light of coronavirus, cross-party group saysBenjamin Blackwell, now aged 15, claims he contracted narcolepsy after getting Pandemrix jabPSNI arrested two men, aged 32 and 55Co Offaly town expresses disappointment at removal of local Fianna F\u0026aacuteil TD from CabinetStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305477.1594843367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"delayed reopening a kick in the teeth say devastated publicans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRonan Lynch, owner of The Swan on Aungier Street, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe delay in allowing pubs to reopen has been described as “devastating” by a third-generation Dublin publican who said everything was already in place for a planned reopening next Monday.The Swan, on the corner of Aungier Street and York Street in Dublin 2, is one of a handful of Victorian pubs left in the city. Its owner, Ronan Lynch, said the decision was “a disgrace”.He pointed out that he had a range of health-and-safety measures planned including social distancing and hand sanitisation stations and strict guidelines for staff to follow.He accused the Government of failing to even discuss any details of the measures already taken and those which were still required with the industry.“This is absolutely devastating,” he said. “We have been closed for 18 weeks and were the first and hardest hit sector . We all have financial commitments and things are just going to get harder and harder. It is so frustrating because we have not had any communication from Government as to what more we need to do.”He said the successful reopening at the end of June of pubs that serve food had given the sector great confidence that the remaining pubs would be facilitated from Monday, which made the news even harder to swallow.“There has been no dialogue from Government, it has been appalling, and we will end up being closed for 40 per cent of the year. We missed St Patrick’s Day, the end of the football and rugby season, all other sports and the tourist season, and on top of all that we have Brexit coming down the tracks.”He said what made it harder to understand was that publicans were already accustomed to managing customers better than most other sectors and knew how to control their space in a responsible fashion.‘Devastation’His views were echoed by others in the pub trade.“It is just devastation for us, the work we have put in to be ready for Monday for them to simply say we can’t reopen for another three weeks,” said Paul Moynihan of Moynihan’s Bar in Donard, Co Wicklow. “And it will be devastating for our customers too.”He pointed out that house parties and other social gatherings would continue where there would be few guidelines followed, “and yet we are the ones being kicked in the teeth”.“I can’t fathom it. Even on a personal level I was really looking forward to seeing our customers again, and we would have been well able to control it, but nobody appears to be listening to us.”Walsh’s pub in Stoneybatter has reconfigured its operation so it can reopen as planned on Monday.“The delay is simply not fair on so many pubs,” owner Anthony Malone said. “We were concerned this might happen and have been planning to offer food, and that is what we will do. Everything will be by the book and it will hopefully be another small step back to normal.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305303.1594832126!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public health ahead of commercial reality says hotelier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeitrim Sean Nós dancer-videographer Edwina Guckian and her son Páidí  with singer Eleanor Shanley  working on the   Enjoy Leitrim promotional video. Photograph: Brian FarrellA Co Leitrim hotelier has said while the consequences of the 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas visitors will be economically catastrophic, he does not want tourists who have not followed the rule staying at his hotel. Joe Dolan, a director of Fáilte Ireland and former president of the Irish Hotels Federation, said public health “has to take precedence over commercial reality” during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I would frown on overseas visitors who had not quarantined coming into my hotel,” he said. Mr Dolan, who owns the Bush Hotel in Carrick-on-Shannon, said he was “speaking with my heart and not my head” and understood the logic of the 14-day isolation requirement. “I wish it were not the case, but it is probably necessary. But the economic consequences for Ireland will be catastrophic because this will eliminate all short-stay visitors, including from the UK, our biggest market,” he said. He was speaking in advance of the launch of Enjoy Leitrim, a three-minute promotional video he has commissioned showcasing the benefits of visiting and living in the county. The video includes contributions from locally based writers and musicians including Michael Harding, Seamus O’Rourke, Eleanor Shanley and Charlie McGettigan, and will be launched on Thursday on the Leitrim Tourism social media channels. Edwina Guckian of Dreoilín Productions, who made the video during the lockdown, said the timing meant she was forced to focus on the county’s landscape rather than its people. “Myself and the four artists who were involved wanted to get the message across that we should appreciate what we have here, and this has been brought home to us during the pandemic,” she said. “We want people to know there is more out there than the Ring of Kerry and the Cliffs of Moher.” Mr Dolan said the current circumstances were making it extremely difficult for the tourism sector in Leitrim and around the country to operate, with many businesses expected to decide at the end of the summer whether to shut up shop for the winter. “For some it will be a case that they will lose less money by being closed than by staying open,” he said. Subsidy schemeHe added that while the Government’s Wage Subsidy Scheme had been crucial to the survival of many businesses including his own during the pandemic, other measures were needed such as waivers on rates and water charges. The owner of the 65-bedroom hotel, who laid off his staff at the start of the coronavirus lockdown, said he had 65 staff at the height of last year’s tourist season but only about half of that number had so far returned, though others were due back next week. “I would have to close my doors tomorrow without the Wage Subsidy Scheme,” said the hotelier, who believes he is luckier than many as almost 80 per cent of his business is domestic. He said the general consensus in the hotel sector was that while “you can’t get a cottage in the country for love nor money”, hotel room occupancy would be 25-33 per cent this year with consumer confidence a big factor. Mr Dolan also said a Government announcement about a package for the hospitality sector was expected and he believed a lot of businesses would need a non-repayable grant scheme to bridge the difference “between what we need to borrow and want we can afford to repay”. A cut in the VAT rate for the sector would be a key factor in stimulating bookings and sales, he added. “The last cut in VAT was very effective , the most innovative job creation strategy after the financial crisis,” he said.

He added that he hoped there would be no need for enforcement of wearing face covering in shops.The president of the Irish Hotels Federation Elaina Fitzgerald Kane has said that “hitting the pause button” on the relaxation of Covid-19 regulations will put thousands of hospitality jobs at risk at a time when hotel room occupancy is only 30 per cent.Ms Fitzgerald Kane called for more clarity around the Phase 4 reopening, including linking the size of a gathering to the capacity of a venue.While she understood the reason for the pause on the final phase of reopening, she was disappointed. The pause will also have an impact on people who had planned gatherings in hotels and wedding venues, she said.Around 18,000 couples this year will have their wedding day plans impacted by Covid-19 with many already changing their arrangements two to three times, she added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305505.1594846205!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry cowen sacking could cause major fianna f%C3%A1il rift tds say","story":"Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen has been sacked by Taoiseach Micheál Martin who told the Dáil that the Offaly TD would no longer serve in Cabinet arising from continuing controversy over his drink-driving conviction.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe dismissal of Barry Cowen as Minister for Agriculture by Taoiseach Micheál Martin has the potential to cause a serious rift in the parliamentary party, its TDs have said.In the Dáil on Wednesday Mr Martin strongly stood over his decision to sack Mr Cowen on Tuesday night after the latter refused to make a further statement on the drink-driving ban he received in 2016.But in a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the Taoiseach and his decision to sack him, Mr Cowen told Fianna Fáil activists in his constituency that the party was “definitely bigger” than Mr Martin.“FF is bigger than me. It’s definitely bigger than M Martin. I have apologised for my actions. I made a stupid mistake but I did not do what they have accused me of,” he texted.The Taoiseach also told the Dáil he had “never sought in any shape or form to undermine . . . the accuracy or credibility of any Garda statement on the file”.That put his position on the Garda Pulse report of the incident directly at odds with that of Mr Cowen. The Offaly TD has strongly refuted a statement in the report that he tried to evade a Garda checkpoint.The  understands the Garda Pulse record is brief and says Mr Cowen turned his car off the road ahead of gardaí up ahead.It suggests that when the gardaí went to check where his car had gone, they engaged him in conversation and detected the drink-driving offence.No vettingGardaí have also said they process requests for access to personal data without preferential treatment and do not carry out ministerial vetting.Fianna Fáil TDs contacted yesterday said as many as a third of the party’s members would be sceptical of, or openly opposed to, Mr Martin’s leadership. One said a substantial minority believed the coalition with Fine Gael could lead to the ruination of the party.Another TD said: “Those outside the fold believe Micheál is a spent docket. The only question is: will there be a challenge to him sooner rather than later?”In a move widely expected, deputy leader Dara Calleary was appointed new Minister for Agriculture. Dublin West TD Jack Chambers has been named as Mr Calleary’s successor as chief whip with responsibility for the Gaeltacht. In a tweet he promised to work hard to improve his Irish.

And so, with nothing else to talk about, he, Jennifer Bray, Pat Leahy and Harry McGee had to talk about the overnight sacking of Barry Cowen, the record-winningly short-tenured agriculture minister, for a drink driving conviction several years ago. The festival – supported by Peugeot – is a series of online talks taking place from Monday July 13th to Thursday 16th“It’s been a placid start for the new government, I don’t think,” said Leahy. Leahy put it in a broader context: “I think what we’ve seen over recent weeks is the effect of being so long in opposition for Fianna Fáil. That ruthless self-discipline… I think at least some of that has left the party, and we now have a situation where Micheál Martin has a number of very significant enemies in the party.”Bray discussed the grudges and disaffection within Fianna Fáil and said Martin was unlikely to lead them into the next election. Fianna Fáil had a particular challenge, said Bray, “They have a lot to prove… They have to prove they’re fiscally prudent, responsible and capable of rebooting the economy… It’s their opportunity to waste.”  McGee reported on the dissatisfaction at the grass roots of the Green Party and the “good mannered” leadership battle between Catherine Martin and Eamon Ryan. Bray discussed the manner in which Fine Gael went from being “defeated” to being reinvigorated by their response to the pandemic, just as Martin was taking on leadership of the country. A viewer asked whether Varadkar would leave the leadership of Fine Gael as he has suggested. McGee noted that though the Fine Gael leader had mentioned he would like to retire from politics by the age of 50, “I don’t think Leo Varadkar is in any hurry to go anywhere.” They briefly discussed Sinn Féin and their chances of coming into power with the next election. Leahy ended the discussion by suggesting that Sinn Féin would have to unite the parties of the left and offer an “alternative sort of government”. Thursday, the final night of the festival, will include: former US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power lawyer and former White House insider Melody Barnes (both interviewed by Fintan O’Toole) and musician Imelda May (in conversation with Róisín Ingle).Ticket buyers receive a link by email on each day of the festival, allowing them to attend the events via their phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305539.1594848401!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord things just keep getting better for the new taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe There is an apocryphal rule often attributed to Tony Blair’s former spokesman Alastair Campbell that if a politician continues to be mired in controversy a fortnight after the story first breaks then he or she will have to walk the plank.The saga that concluded with the demise of Barry Cowen’s short-lived ministerial career did not last quite so long - 12 days. However, it did follow an arc very similar to that of previous minsters who were sacked, or forced to resign, such as Alan Shatter and Frances Fitzgerald.Friday, July 3rd:Rumours have been circulating for some days about a drinking ban that Cowen had in the past. Both Cowen’s office and that of Taoiseach Micheál Martin are contacted by the Irish Independent with records purporting to show that Cowen was given a three-month ban for drink-driving in 2016 and also received a €200 fine. It is the first that Martin has known of the offence.Saturday, July 4th:The report is published. It also emerges that Cowen (49) was driving on a provisional licence and had been for some years. He issues a statement saying he is “profoundly sorry”. He also lets it be known he now has a full driving licence but does not disclose when he made the test.Sunday, July 5th:The situation has now become a crisis for Fianna Fáil. The party has earlier had to contend with internal ructions over ministerial appointments. Cowen, in the first of a series of apologies, is a guest on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics.He makes a candid apology. “The fact of the matter was it was a terribly stupid, stupid, mistake on my part,” he says. “It is something that I am very regretful for.”He admits that he had driven unaccompanied on occasions when on a learner permit and says, in hindsight, maybe he should have informed Micheál Martin at the time.Paul Murphy, the Rise TD, says it is “bizarre” that anybody who is close to 50 did not have a full licence.Further stories emerge about a speeding ticket and another minor road traffic infractions, seemingly gleaned from a Garda Pulse report.Monday, July 6th:Amid persistent demands from the Opposition for more clarity, it emerges that Cowen has contacted the Ceann Comhairle asking to make a personal statement on the matter in the Dáil. It is agreed he will speak the following day.Micheál Martin seems reassured by Cowen’s apology and explanation for not contacting him earlier. “He was deeply ashamed of it and embarrassed that the incident occurred in 2016,” he says.Tuesday July 7th:Cowen makes a personal statement in the Dáil at 9pm. He again apologises about his “stupid mistake”.He explains for the first time the details of his drink-driving arrest. It happened on the day of the All Ireland football final. He was stopped in Co Kildare as he was returning to Co Offaly with a friend.“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly. On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a Breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit.”While he was on a provisional licence at the time, he says “I subsequently secured and now hold a full clean driving licence.“Before reform it was not uncommon for people of all ages and experience to be on a provisional licence.”He also says he has spoken to a number of road safety campaigners earlier that day including Susan Gray of Parc. He says he had apologised to them.But Gray later criticises Cowen, saying he failed to address various aspects of his driving licence. She and others call for him to specify how many learner permits he held, and if he displayed “L” or “N” plates on his car.Sunday, July 12th:The controversy seems to have receded a bit. However, The Sunday Times now reports details of the Garda record of the September 2016 incident which alleges the Offaly TD was pursed by gardaí after doing a U-turn before a Garda checkpoint.Cowen begins a robust defence. He claims the Garda record is “incorrect” and says the fact that gardaí leaked a Pulse record was an act of criminality.He states that he had never evaded or avoided a Garda checkpoint. “I did not evade or attempt to evade a garda. Such an act would constitute a serious criminal offence,” he says.It was, arguably, a more serious offence than the drink-driving ban. Under Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act failure to stop a vehicle when required by a Garda is a criminal offence, punishable by fine, andor imprisonment.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) is asked by the Garda to investigate the circumstances in which the confidential Garda Pulse record of the incident was leaked to the media.Other details are now emerging. It is clear that copies of the Garda Pulse record had been leaked to reporters at least ten days before then. And the record contained the allegation that Cowen had tried to avoid the checkpoint.This allegation of evasion had been put to Cowen and to Fianna Fáil as early as July 3rd, nine days beforehand. However, Cowen had denied it very strenuously. It had not appeared in earlier media reports and Cowen himself had made no reference to it.The previous week Martin had briefed Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green leader Eamon Ryan on the incident but had made no mention of the alleged evasion of the checkpoint. Varadkar had said he did not want any more surprises.Monday, July 13th:Perhaps the day that sealed Barry Cowen’s fate. Asked for comment by RTÉ’s Midlands Correspondent Ciarán Mulooly, Cowen says that under legal advice he was not making any further comment until such time as Gsoc issued its report.Varadkar is interviewed on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. He refers to his comments from the previous week where he wanted no more surprises and then refers to the new revelations. However, the thrust of his interview is calibrated. He does not call for a head and seems to accept that perhaps allowing the Gsoc investigation to follow its course might be the preferable option.Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin, speaking on Newstalk, says Cowen needs to clarify matters further.That is the theme being pursued by the Opposition parties who are asking Cowen to make a new statement and also to answer questions in the Dáil. Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly says the fact there was a dispute between his account and that of the Garda record showed the need for him to answer questions in the Dáil.\u0026nbsp“He has said he wants to draw a line under it, the Taoiseach says he wants to draw a line under it. Clearly a line has not been drawn under it. We are still talking about it now ten days after it was first revealed.”The previous week, Cowen had requested and received the Pulse report of the incident from the Garda. He and Martin have a lengthy conversation on Monday night about the record. Martin asks to see it.As questions are raised about the source of the leaks, the Meath East TD Thomas Byrne rejects suggestions that he had tipped off the media about Cowen’s run-in with the Garda.“There’s a civil matter in relation to this. It does not involve me. I’m on good terms with Barry Cowen,” he tells LMFM in an interview.Tuesday July 14th:Micheál Martin and Cowen meet to further discuss the matter. Cowen shows Martin the Pulse report, which suggests a more benign interpretation of events than had been portrayed by the media.Martin lets Cowen know that in his view a “comprehensive statement was required” and that he as Minister and an office holder was obliged to come before the House to explain himself.“In my view, the issue could only be resolved with the political route.”Martin tells Cowen it does not have to be on Tuesday, or even Wednesday but at some stage a comprehensive statement is required.At around 11.30am, Martin meets Varadkar and Ryan and tells them that Cowen has said he will make no further statement and he has had asked him to reflect on his position. Both said they agreed with his position and would support what decision he would make.Sources in both parties insist that neither forced the issue in any way or “sought a head on a plate”.“I thought when the Taoiseach went in at 2pm he was actually going to announce that Cowen was gone,” said one.In the event, Martin gave a partial defence of Cowen under questioning in the Dáil from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. Again he referred to some ambiguity in the Pulse record.“I saw the document myself this morning and having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed. \u0026nbspNonetheless, the document is there.”In those sentences, he was outlining the problem (the Pulse document existed and needed to be explained) and the possible solution for Cowen (a more benign reading of it).But it needed Cowen to agree to make a fresh statement before the Dáil and answer questions.Shortly after Leaders’ Questions Martin went to the canteen in Leinster House and spoke casually to journalists. He pointed out that the statement made no explicit reference to a “U-turn”. It seemed to suggest that he was still holding out hope Cowen would change his mind.The relatively spirited defence of Cowen, plus the refusal to allow a statement, suggested that the Government was holding a line and was now prepared to weather out the controversy. Those with experience of previous occasions when office holders were sacked or resigned were familiar with the temporal arc. The controversy would reach a point where the pressure was so unbearable and the clamour so frenzied that the Minister was holding on by a thread. One more sliver of trouble would be enough to topple him or her.As one former Fine Gael minister said on Tuesday: “It had not reached that point. It was much too early. Nobody had any expectation that he was about to get sacked.”And that’s why it took so many by surprise. Just before 9pm, Martin went to the Dáil to announce he had sacked Cowen over his refusal to make a further statement. He said there were questions that needed clarification and it was not tenable for other Ministers to provide a proxy for Cowen by trying to answer them.So what happened in the intervening seven hours? Well, it seemed that well before 2pm, Martin had already made up his mind that Cowen had to go if he refused to make a second statement.His defence of him in the Dáil was affording the Offaly TD a final chance to address the issues. Later that afternoon he formally asked Cowen to reconsider. Cowen refused. He then asked him to resign. He refused. The plank was now readied.Within half an hour of the bombshell, Cowen responded with a lengthy statement on Twitter, with a direct cut at Martin for sacking him only seven hours after backing him.“Ten days ago and this afternoon the Taoiseach believed my failure of 2016 didn’t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse report I gave him this morning.“Unfortunately the decision of the Taoiseach to remove me from office, when he supported me this afternoon in the Dáil, has undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process,” he said.Publicly, Fianna Fáil TDs strongly backed the Taoiseach’s decision, praising him for being decisive. They also expressed personal sympathy for Cowen, who is popular and respected by his colleagues.Wednesday July 15th:Martin’s disposition was matter-of-fact and unruffled during Leaders Questions in the Dáil’s temporary home of the National Convention Centre. He refuted Mary Lou McDonald’s claim that he (Martin) challenged the Garda report, arguing that he had never done that, and that was why he expected Cowen to make a clarification.Cowen arrives at the centre and goes into the chamber. He is seen talking to John McGuinness and, later, to Eamon O Cuív. They may be chance encounters but they underline the potential split within the party.

Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"colstons real replacement must rebuke cancel culture","story":"Overnight, Black Lives Matter elves erected a statue on the plinth vacated by Edward Colston when his likeness took an early bath in Bristol Harbour last month. The new incumbent, entitled “A Surge of Power”, depicts BLM protester Jen Reid engaged in a black power salute. “It’s something the people of Bristol appreciate seeing,” Reid declared of the depiction of herself, hours after the substitution. Even we anti-iconoclasts must admire the chutzpah.Yet the statue is a serious piece of work, created by Marc Quinn, who sculpted Alison Lapper Pregnant which occupied Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth in the noughties. Aesthetically, it’s a winner, in my (layman’s) opinion. But it cannot stay where it is. This would demonstrate the authorities’ craven abdication of decision-making to unelected activists. Its erection, without a shred of debate, is consistent with BLM’s Marxist roots.Bristol city councillors insist that residents should decide on Colston’s replacement. My first choice would be to restore the slaverphilanthropist to his plinth, ideally in a ceremonial procession flanked by local dignitaries, purely to send out a robust condemnation of vandalism. Among less isive Bristolian candidates gorgeous Cary Grant or the recently-cancelled John Cleese, preferably in full Fawlty Towers goose-step mode. But a public consultation could also yield a joke winner, designed to wind up the judges (“Plinthy McPlinthface”?)As an offspring of a Bristolian father, and therefore deserving of at least half a vote (identity politics is everywhere now), I have a modest proposal. A statue in homage to the city’s most famous living daughter, JK Rowling, ideally a substantial artefact with artistic heft, not a piece of Harry Potter kitsch involving centaurs and wands. It should reflect her status as creator of a significant cultural export, a canon which inspired millions of otherwise book-phobic youngsters to become enthusiastic readers and sparked a renaissance in British filmmaking.The statue would also provide the perfect rebuke to a loathsome contemporary trend. For readers fortunate enough to have missed the latest broadsides in this internecine war, Rowling, despite her decades of support for progressive causes, has been summarily “cancelled” by the Left and denounced as a bigot for refusing to bend to trans orthodoxy over biological sex. As one of a vanishingly rare breed prepared to speak out, celebrating her would sound a powerful rallying cry for free expression and intellectual courage.The city urgently needs this wake-up call. Bristol University recently abandoned young academic Raquel Rosario Sanchez to a vicious two-year bullying campaign. Since chairing an event for the organisation Woman’s Place on proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act, Sanchez has been hounded by trans activists, even forced to hire her own private security guards to guarantee her safety on campus. Shamefully, this lofty Russell Group institution failed to protect her or discipline those responsible.Honouring Rowling would underscore three unfashionable truths that biological sex is no mere social construct, that mob tactics are entirely unacceptable and that free speech should remain an inalienable right on campus – and everywhere else.

It was photographed close to the starboard side of the ferry.The report says the two vessels could have been within 100m of each other as the ferry, which had 282 passengers and crew on board, took the avoiding action.Although aware of the ferry, the submarine’s control room team had overestimated the civilian craft’s range and underestimated its speed. The report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said the submarine’s commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that\u2028”might have appeared rational to them at the time” but were actually based on inaccurate information. The report cited two previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels in recent years. In all three incidents key decisions on board the submarines were made based on “an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity” the report said. The Stena Superfast VII ferry was just over 200m long and weighed 30,285 tons. Given a closing speed of around 27 knots between the two vessels there was every chance that the ferry would have suffered significant underwater damage had a collision occurred.It is not known if the Royal Navy vessel was an Astute or Trafalgar Class hunter killer boat, or one of the four Vanguard Class nuclear-armed deterrent submarines. There were no nuclear safety issues during the near miss.The report said there is no expectation that the bridge team of a merchant ship should be able to detect or avoid a submerged submarine. The investigation board said it was “extremely fortunate” that Stena Superfast VII’s lookout spotted the submarine’s periscope.The  understands the Royal Navy has accepted in full the recommendations of the report. A thorough safety investigation in 2018 identified the necessary actions to prevent a re-occurrence and these have now been enacted by the Navy and explained to the MAIB. Administrative action was taken against at least one member of the submarine’s crew rather than disciplinary proceedings. The MoD said it would be “inappropriate to comment any further on inidual cases”.The incident is the third in four years involving Royal Navy submarines and civilian vessels.On 15 April 15, 2015, a submarine was deep in the Irish Sea when it snagged the fishing vessel Karen’s trawl wires. Karen was dragged backwards at about seven knots and partially submerged before the trawl wires snapped.On 20 July 20, 2016 the Royal Navy attack submarine, HMS Ambush, collided with the merchant vessel Andreas near Gibraltar.HMS Ambush was at periscope depth and conducting tactical training exercises at the time. A subsequent investigation found the crew were not maintaining a continuous all-round look to reduce the risk of detection in a simulated threat environment. The report stated the key common factor between the latest incident and two previous collisions involving submerged Royal Navy submarines was the absence of a sufficiently accurate plot of surface shipping, a critical factor to ensure sound decision-making.A Royal Navy Spokesperson said: “Ensuring safety at sea is a top priority for the Royal Navy, which is why we welcome this report and have already taken action to tighten our training and procedures.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/12/16/gettyimages-647615996.jpg","title":"brad pitt leonardo dicaprio once upon a time in hollywood cars sale auction memorabilia","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Sale will also feature Tom Cruise’s ‘Top Gun’ helmet,\u0026nbspSylvester Stallone’s ‘Rocky’ boxing gloves, and moreThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Early estimates showed there were 1.9 per cent less people on employers\u0027 payrolls in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment fell 17,000 between March and May to 1.35 million, leaving the official rate unchanged at 3.9 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, experts warned that the jobs figures masked the true scale of the crisis. The number of hours worked dropped at the fastest pace on record, suggesting that the headline unemployment is an underestimate.Average weekly hours worked per person fell to a record low of 26.6 between March and May, down by 5.5 hours on the same period a year ago. Weekly data show that hours worked began to recover in May, with self-employed people seeing a significant rise in work.Can we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?Job vacancies fell to 333,000 - almost two-thirds lower than in June last year and the lowest number since the ONS began collecting comparable data in 2001.The claimant count, which includes people on universal credit or jobseeker\u0027s allowance, more than doubled between March and May to 1.4 million, before levelling off in June.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of people temporarily away from work dropped from a peak of  8.8 million in April to 6.3 million by the end of May.That figure is likely to have continued to rise as non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants - all big employers - began to re-open in June.However, almost a third of businesses plan to cut staff in the next three months, according to a survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found.Government plans to slow the expected surge in joblessness have attracted criticism, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies labelling them badly timed and poorly targeted.Last week Rishi Sunak announced subsidies for restaurant meals, a VAT cut for hospitality firms and a £1,000 bonus for each furloughed employee brought back into work and kept on until January.The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that much of the furlough bonus was dead weight, meaning it would be wasted on paying employers for workers they had intended to keep on anyway.Minister for Employment Mims Davies said: “We know that people are worried about their livelihoods which is why we\u0027ve put in place a Plan For Jobs.”A crucial part of that is doubling the number of frontline work coaches so that every jobseeker gets support to find work as well as launching the Kickstart scheme to create hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers are said to believe they have made a breakthrough after discovering the jab could provide “double protection” against the virus.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Early estimates showed there were 1.9 per cent less people on employers\u0027 payrolls in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said. Unemployment fell 17,000 between March and May to 1.35 million, leaving the official rate unchanged at 3.9 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, experts warned that the jobs figures masked the true scale of the crisis. The number of hours worked dropped at the fastest pace on record, suggesting that the headline unemployment is an underestimate.Average weekly hours worked per person fell to a record low of 26.6 between March and May, down by 5.5 hours on the same period a year ago. Weekly data show that hours worked began to recover in May, with self-employed people seeing a significant rise in work.Can we trust the predictions for Britain’s economy?Job vacancies fell to 333,000 - almost two-thirds lower than in June last year and the lowest number since the ONS began collecting comparable data in 2001.The claimant count, which includes people on universal credit or jobseeker\u0027s allowance, more than doubled between March and May to 1.4 million, before levelling off in June.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of people temporarily away from work dropped from a peak of  8.8 million in April to 6.3 million by the end of May.That figure is likely to have continued to rise as non-essential retailers, pubs and restaurants - all big employers - began to re-open in June.However, almost a third of businesses plan to cut staff in the next three months, according to a survey this week by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) found.Government plans to slow the expected surge in joblessness have attracted criticism, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies labelling them badly timed and poorly targeted.Last week Rishi Sunak announced subsidies for restaurant meals, a VAT cut for hospitality firms and a £1,000 bonus for each furloughed employee brought back into work and kept on until January.The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that much of the furlough bonus was dead weight, meaning it would be wasted on paying employers for workers they had intended to keep on anyway.Minister for Employment Mims Davies said: “We know that people are worried about their livelihoods which is why we\u0027ve put in place a Plan For Jobs.”A crucial part of that is doubling the number of frontline work coaches so that every jobseeker gets support to find work as well as launching the Kickstart scheme to create hundreds of thousands of new, fully subsidised jobs for young people across the country.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They need our help.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWe can all play a part in saving our towns and cities.If we head out to eat, drink and shop, we can throw a leline to businesses on the edge.It’s our patriotic duty to get back to the pub.For years, town centres have struggled because it is hard for shops to compete with the online retail giants.The switch from old-style shopping to ordering online has sped up in lockdown.The Government’s massive programme of economic support has helped many businesses survive.A total of £.billion in grants has been paid to more than , firms, mainly in hospitality and retail.The Government is also paying the wages of .million people through the furlough scheme.I have heard from small businesses in my Chipping Barnet constituency in Greater London how vital this help has been in getting them through lockdown.But the only long-term way to save these businesses is for customers to start heading through their doors again.That is why I was one of the first MPs to call for the lockdown to be lted.Now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given us the freedom to go back to work and back into town, we need to use it.With so many still working from home, our city centres feel like ghost towns.Jobs are already going or under threat at many familiar big names, from Boots and Burger King to Pret and John Lewis.Taxi drivers, caterers, news vendors, cleaners, millions of livelihoods depend on bustl-ing offices and workplaces filled with people.The situation is very grave. Economists are predicting one of the worst global recessions since records began, with up to .million Brits potentially losing jobs.All the evidence indicates that prosperity is driven by successful cities.If tumbleweed continues to roll through London’s world-class tourist attractions,Manchester’s bars and clubs are half empty,Newcastle’s nightle remains muted, then pulling ourselves out of recession will be far harder.For the sake of all our great cities, we need office workers back at their desks.Of course, it is vital that we behave responsibly and respect social-distancing rules.Huge care has been taken to ensure the process of lting the lockdown is a cautious and gradual one, with some £million being spent to make the high street safe and ready to welcome people back.And I pay tribute to the massive efforts being made by businesses doing everything possible to make their premises Covid-secure to keep their workers and customers safe.I know their reluctance toto public transport. I see that every day as I commute to Westminster on near-empty Tube carriages.But the simple precautions of wearing a face covering and washing your hands thoroughly when you reach your destination can help keep you and others safe.Nothing in le comes without some risk, but the steady fall in Covid cases means that, for the vast majority of us, the risk of catching the virus is getting lower every day.So people should feel confident to go out to their workplace again, and they should also feel happy and secure about grabbing a bite to eat with friends in a cafe.This could be make or break for your city centre.Unless you come to the rescue by spending some money to support these local businesses, they could go under for ever.Saving our city and town centres isn’t just about jobs and the economy.They are the heart of community le.As an example, for many elderly people, popping out to the shops is a hugely important social contact, especiallythey do not have family living nearby.If our town centres become a row of empty shops and boarded-up pubs, that is a heartbreaking loss for our whole community.It would leave all of us more isolated from our neighbours.When the pandemic hit, this country came together in an incredible united effort to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Now we need to show that same determination when it comes to reviving the economy, saving jobs and supporting businesses in our villages, towns and cities.That means starting up the commute again and getting back to the office.It’s not every day that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says he will knock £ off our lunch bills.But that is what will happen during August.Soyou value your local High Street and want to see it thrive in the future, then head there and eat out to help out.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No said this afternoon: It wouldnt be mandatoryyou went in, for example to go into a sandwich shop to wear a face covering. It is mandatory for shops rather than food shops.But Mr Hancock told Sky News this morning: You do need to wear a face mask in Pret because Pret is a shop - in hospitality, there needs to be table service.If theres table service, it is not necessary to have a mask. But in any shop, you do need the mask. So,youre going up to the counter in Pret to buy takeaway that is a shop, butyou go to your local pub you cant go to the bar.The reason is because of the risk of transmission over the bar. A spokesman for the Department of Health said this morning face masks would need to be worn at the counter, but not when customers eat and drink. The new rules will make face masks compulsory from July  in England and people will face a £ finethey fail to comply.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted: This is frankly ridiculous. The virus doesnt knowyoure in a take-away or a supermarket.The Government is risking the health of the public to cover the back of a Cabinet Minister. Please wear a face covering in all shops and take aways.The bungled message on masks in cafes comes after Environment Secretary refused to rule out masks in offices yesterday, only for Mr Hancock to say  hours later they would definitely not need to be worn. Mr Hancock said today: “The reason for that is when you are in close proximity with somebody who you have to work closely with,you are there for a long time then a mask does not offer that protection, as opposed to a shop or public transport when you are with someone for a reasonable amount of time.“The point is when you are in interaction with people you aren’t normally with, that’s when the mask is particularly helpful.Mr Hancock was slammed by Lorraine Kelly this morning for the Governments relaxation of rules. She said the measures to stop the spread of coronavirus had been smashed to smithereens. Labour Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said the Governments muddle over masks was just hopeless. He said: We have had mixed messages from Government all week and it seems that once again they are making it up as they go along.“We need clear and consistent messages about when the wearing of a face covering will be compulsory not attempts at redefining what a shop is.“Public safety and confidence are key to preventing a second wave and the Government need to raise their game in ensuring that everyone knows when the wearing of a mask is required.”Government guidance already advises people to wear masks where they are indoors and unable to social distance but yesterday Michael Gove was spotted leaving a Pret without a mask. Mr Hancock said the photo was taken before the policy was formally announced. But Liz Truss, another Cabinet minister, sported a blue mask coming out of the same Pret in Westminster.

Of course, we will seek to learn the lessons of this pandemic in the future and certainly we will have an independent inquiry into what happened. Officials said there was no date yet for an inquiry but it would come forward in due course.Its also not clear how much it might cost, who would lead the inquiry, and how long it would last.Many of the Governments top ministers have also stressed that it is too soon to start calling for an inquiry into coronavirus. There have been almost , deaths from coronavirus in the UK - the highest death toll in Europe. A report for Government scientists this week said a second wave in the winter could kill , people. One of the biggest issues MPs are keen to examine is how coronavirus wrought havoc in care homes. Questioning the PM today, Liberal Democrat MP Sir Ed Davey said: We have suffered one of the worst death rates in the world and Europes worst death rate for health and care workers. A report by the National Audit Office, assessing the readiness of the NHS and the social care sector for coronavirus, showed it was not known how many of the , people discharged from hospitals into care homes were infected with coronavirus. A fth of the nations most vulnerable people in care home have been infected by the deadly virus. There are also questions surrounding the Government decision to go into lockdown weeks later than many other European countries. The PM has backflipped on ious policies, including face masks - which will be mandatory from July  - but were previously not used because of claims they did not work. MPs have launched their own inquiry earlier this week with an All-Party Parliamentary Group, led by Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran.

The restrictions include a limit of two people from the same household allowed to visit another home.And as part of the new rules, residents are being told to wear cloth face coverings in all enclosed public spaces, including workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres and hair and beauty salons. Health officials also called on locals to elbow bump with anyone outside of their immediate family, while small shops will be given updated public protection advice to ensure social distancing.A mobile testing unit has also been set up at Witton Park Academy in the area, as well as a facility at Royal Blackburn Hospital.Residents have also been told they do not need to have symptoms to take a test.Figures published yesterday showed that Blackburn had  cases per , people in the seven days to July .This marked a signicant increase from . cases per , in the seven days to July .It puts the authority at third on the list of highest weekly rates, but still behind Leicester which has a rate of . cases per ,.Leicester went back into lockdown on June  after a spike in infections, with all non-essential retail stores closed as well as hospitality venues which reopened in the rest of the UK on July .Last weekend, the government drew up a list of  councils facing the worst outbreaks in England - which included Blackburn with Darwen local authority as well as Bradford, Kirklees and Rochdale.Topping the list is Leicester, followed by Rochdale and Bradford in the ranking for the areas with the highest rate of coronavirus cases.Blackburn is fth on the list - but the council have now taken the precautions which will hopefully mean the town wont have to go into a local lockdown.The data shows that Covid infections are rising in other places though with Blackburn, Bedford and Peterborough now on the hotspot danger list.Health officials said that new Covid cases are highest in the East and Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber.Government officials have not yet laid out what metrics will be used to impose further lockdowns.However,reports that ministers are considering a threshold of  weekly positive tests per , people, based on a scheme rolled out in Germany. Mr Harrison said it was up to everyone in the town to ensure a dreaded local lockdown was avoided.He said: These steps will help and we are appealing to everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to follow them to protect themselves and their loved ones.If we dont, a local lockdown, like in Leicester, becomes a very real possibility.We can only avoid further lockdown measureswe work together.He added that a rise in targeted testing would spark a surge in case numbers in the next week to ten days.But should these continue to rise after two weeks, authorities would consider reversing some of the national lockdown lting measures locally one by one.Council leader Mohammed Khan said: I can reassure all local residents that the council is working with dferent agencies and organisations across the borough to help get the message out to everyone that le cannot go back to normal just yet, and we must all make sacrices to avoid a local lockdown.We are doing everything we can to get a grip on the virus, and we need everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to pull together to help us.Please continue to do your bit to stick to the rules to protect yourself and your family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The official advice remains that employees should work from home when they can - although the PM has said in recent days that they should consider coming back into the office. He told ministers this week that tens of thousands of Whitehall civil servants could set an example by ing to work. Ministers are hoping to entice people back by encouraging people to believe that public transport is safe to use. August has been earmarked for the introduction of the new nuanced system for travel networks as it is usually the quietest period, when people are often taking time off anyway. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. It wonapost be a green light for bosses to force all staff back into work, however. Peak rush hour usage between am and am is still to be advised against, which will remain for essential travel. Instead, Brits will be encouraged to drive, walk and cycle, and only use buses and trains between am and pm, and after pm. The new roadmap would show how staff canto work over the next nine months - including details on using public transport safely.  But the chief of the FDA union Dave Penman said: Civil servants are there to provide vital public services, not simply supply customers to city-centre economies at a risk to their personal health.It comes as the UKaposs coronavirus death toll reached , on Wednesday - an increase of  on the day before. Greece has, meanwhile, reopened to direct flights from the UK and Rishi Sunak has admitted tax rises could be on the way to rescue the economy.

We should also move as quickly as possible. The PM said that the case for both Houses staying in place should be considered but that other locations should be in the mix. He stated: However, the review should also consider a possible location outside London. The Government is considering establishing a Government hub in York and it would therefore make sense to consider this as a potential location. The comments came after a new consultation process was launched last month which considered whether MPs and peers would need to vacate the historic building as work is carried out. In the letter to people involved in the review, the PM said: We should also move as quickly as possible, both because of the risks associated with the current state of the building and the need to provide certainty on the way forward and thereby minimise disruption to our business. Before Parliament voted in  to approve the renewal works, which will entail decanting the whole building for at least six years, MPs had pushed rival plans that would have seen only a partial vacating required. This would have forced builders to work around the Commons schedule.The idea has since gained traction again following the coronavirus outbreak.A recent report by the National Audit Officestated that the £ billion cost previously reported for the project was likely to be a median figure, with the final outlay on the Unesco World Heritage Site expected to be higher. Initial estimates put the final bill as high as £ billion, with the builders expected to be in until the s. The body said that a team will assess whether a recommendation made in a report four years ago that all MPs and Lords should leave the Palace of Westminster while the work was carried out is still the best and most cost-effective option.

Backbencher David Morris was handed a £, donation from Aquind Ltd in September . A month later, he asked Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng a question relating to the company in the House of Commons, urging him to lobby energy watchdog Ofgem to change regulations that could benefit Aquind. Mr Kwarteng replied that he would. Mr Morris insisted he had not broken any rules, because he had drawn attention to the register of members’ interests before asking his question. When details of the first donation emerged, Mr Morris told the Times: “No breach of conduct has occurred as the declaration is clearly stated before the question was raised in Hansard as in accordance with the House of Commons rules.

The potentially massive maritime disaster came after the crew of the partially submerged sub had underestimated the ferry’s speed and distance. But the Stena Line ship’s quick-thinking officer took “immediate and effective action” to avoid the collision in the Irish Sea, a report has revealed. The crew of the Royal Navy submarine had spotted the Stena Superfast V vessel seven minutes earlier – calculating its distance at , yards. But they turned across its path believing they had time to get clear.A two-year probe found the sub thought it was , yards away when the ferry swerved.It was actually a quarter of that. The sub is part of Britain’s nuclear-powered fleet, although it is not knownit was one of four that carry nuke missiles.

It was played down by authorities at the time and its severity has only just emerged.It was also revealed it was the third time in four years that a submerged Royal Navy submarine had narrowly missed a collision. Andrew Moll, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents, said: “The lookout on board the ferry spotted a submarine’s periscope close ahead. “The Officer of the Watch then took immediate and effective action, turning the ferry to avoid a genuine risk of collision.”  He says underestimating the ferry’s speed and position led to “safety-critical decisions being made on inaccurate information”. The report adds that the ferry assessed “an imminent risk of collision [and] the OOW [Officer of the Watch] told the lookout to adopt hand-steering and, at :, ° of port rudder was applied.”And it warns: “This was the third [such] accident or incident in four years, which is a matter of signicant concern.” The Maritime Accident Investigations Branch said the control room’s electronic tactical display “presented a picture of a safer situation than reality.” The roll-on, roll-off ferry operates between Belfast and Cairnryan in Scotland, carrying up to , passengers.

But while it meant she could have the le-saving surgery at last, it also marked the beginning of a ­desperate quest to find organs. Thalia has a condition called restrictive cardiomyopathy, which her grandmother Christine Johnson compares to “a ticking bomb”. Christine said: “She could have days, weeks or months. We just don’t know. We got the call we’d waited for for so long. I can’t put into words what that call meant.” The family are all too aware it will be a race against time for the child. But even in their hour of need they have made it their mission to appeal for potential organ donors – to save not just Thalia’s le but all the hundreds of other children waiting for that call. “We’re still a long way off,” ­Christine said. “We need a healthy heart and lungs that’s not just from someone with a blood group that is compatible with Thalia’s, but also approximately the same size. Thalia is one in a million andwe don’t have hope, we don’t have anything. Now we have hope like we haven’t felt in years.” The little girl was diagnosed with the heart condition in  a few days after her fourth birthday and the arrival of her brother Rudy. With no cure or treatment, the family was told her only hope lay in finding her new organs. But she was only assessed as being in enough need or fit enough to go on the list last week. She is in high dependency at Leeds General Infirmary after battling pneumonia and is the only child in the UK on the urgent donor waiting list for a heart and lungs. If or when that call finally comes, she will be blue-lighted to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to replace her organs with healthy ones and give her a chance at le. Thalia’s mum Ellie-Mae, , from Scarborough, North Yorks, said: “Within a week our family went from the euphoria of having a new baby to ­absolute devastation. “Thalia was so excited about turning four and having a little brother. It was like a kne had been placed in our hearts. “Thalia is the most energising, smiley little girl in the world, and for her to finally be on the list is what we’ve been praying for for so long. Of course we’ve a long way to go yet but this last week has felt like a massive step forwards.” Restrictive cardiomyopathy is an exceptionally rare muscle disease which stfens the ventricles around the heart, causing it to become enlarged.  Doctors at Scarborough Hospital noticed Thalia’s was swollen after she was admitted with a chest infection. She was quickly transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where the family were given the nightmare diagnosis. Then began the tortuous waiting game. “It was – and still is – the most horrible state of limbo, trying to pretend everything was normal, Thalia unable to understand how all the odds were stacked against her,” said Christine, , who helps care for her with her husband Simon, , Thalia’s grandfather.    After two further stays in Leeds General Infirmary, Thalia was then referred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for a heart transplant assessment. But Thalia wasn’t deemed to be a viable candidate because by then she had pulmonary hypertension, a secondary disease to her cardiomyopathy, meaning she now also needed a double lung transplant. Thalia was then referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for a second opinion. She did relatively well for a long time after that initial diagnosis, Christine says, enjoying many largely carefree days at the family beach chalet near their home in Scarborough, starting school and a trip of a letime to Disneyland Paris.  However,  brought a rapid decline in her health, with infections and complications meaning more time in hospital. The family shared Thalia’s story on social media to raise awareness of organ donation and to champion the NHS.Their Facebook page now has almost , followers and Thalia has met heroes including Lewis Capaldi and Jason Manford – although she still wants to meet her biggest idol, Stormzy.Christine said: “We’d never heard of restrictive cardio­myopathy, as the chances of having it are exactly what Thalia is to us... one in a million. She’s the most bubbly, sassy, beautul little girl, inside and out. It breaks all our hearts to think about what she’s got, what the future holds. “It’s such a hard thought to take in, knowing that another family’s whole world will come crashing down so that ours can be saved. “But the heart-breaking reality is that tragedies happen every day, where lives can’t be saved. It’s in those terrible circumstances we hope families can find it in themselves to save a le like Thalia’s.” Sadly this isn’t the first time the family have faced a member needing organ donation. Christine’s nephew and Thalia’s cousin, Alistair Haythorne, , has received three kidney transplants to date.He is currently on dialysis and will hopefully be listed for a fourth transplant in the near future – making the family all too aware of the need for organ donors. Nearly  children have died in the UK in the past  years waiting on the organ donor transplant list.  Angie Scales, NHS Blood and Transplant lead nurse for paediatric donation, says: “It’s so important for families to talk about organ donation and to include their children in those conversations. By saying yes to organ donation, families are in a position to give another family hope. “Donor families tell us they take great pride and comfort from the knowledge that they have helped to save lives.” Simon said the family has been contacted by “countless strangers around the world” saying how they have been inspired by Thalia to sign up to organ donor registers.

Ms Turner stated that she did not know when Meghan might make a bid for the White House - but it could be in the not too distant future, reports the Express. America is set to go to the polls in November with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden looking increasingly likely that he will replace incumbent Donald Trump.Ms Turner said: She will run for President, I have no doubt about it. I have no doubt, I think this is all part of the plan. It may not be very soon but it will be. A rather sceptical Jeremy Vine said it was the first time I have ever heard anyone say that. Ms Turner replied: I have it on fairly good authority that she would like to run for President There may be worse Presidents, I would like to see a mixed-race woman in the White House, I would. Mr Vine said: I don’t know whether woke wins elections, that is the problem here. Ms Turner asked: What do you mean by woke  Opinionated   Mr Vine responded: Woke is not aligning with where consensus is now, I suppose that is the thing.The Duchess of Sussex has hit out at the treatment by “those in the corridors of power” in her first speech since quitting her role in the royal family. In a pre-recorded video, Meghan spoke to the Girl Up  Leadership Summit, as part of a session called The Time Is Now. Speaking from her Los Angeles home, Meghan, , said: “I want to share something with you. “It’s that those in the halls and corridors and places of power, from lawmakers and world leaders to executives, all of those people, they depend on you more than you will ever depend on them. “And here’s the thing: they know this. “They know that all of you, at a younger age than any modern comparison, are setting the tone for an equitable humanity. Not figuratively, literally. “This is a humanity that desperately needs you.  “To push it, to push us, forcefully in a more inclusive, more just, and more empathetic direction. “To not only frame the debate, but be in charge of the debate—on racial justice, gender, climate change, mental health and wellbeing, on civic engagement, on public service, on so much more. “That’s the work you’re already out there doing.” Meghan and husband Prince Harry left their royal roles officially in March and now live in a friend’s borrowed £million mansion. In recent weeks they have criticised the Commonwealth’s “uncomfortable past” while Meghan has hit out at her treatment at the hands of the royal family saying she felt “unprotected”.

The phase  trial in healthy adult volunteers, which began in April, showed the vaccine generated an immune response, with blood samples indicating it stimulated the body to produce both antibodies and killer T-cells, the Dailyreported. It came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said teams were working towards a best case scenario of a vaccine being made available some time this year, although he conceded it was more likely in . David Carpenter, chairman of the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, which approved the Oxford trial and continues to work with scientists on amendments, told thethat the team were absolutely on track. They can strengthen findings by targeting people in hospitals, healthcare professionals, where the spread is [more] likely to happen, he said. Nobody can put final dates... things might go wrong but the reality is that by working with a big pharma company, that vaccine could be fairly widely available around September and that is the sort of target they are working on. But a source told the newspaper that the results did not yet prove that the Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx nCoV-, provides long-lasting immunity. I can tell you that we now know the Oxford vaccine covers both bases - it produces both a T cell and an antibody response, the source said. Itaposs the combination of these two that will hopefully keep people safe. So far, so good. Itaposs an important moment. But we still have a long way to go.  Speaking on ITVaposs Peston on Wednesday evening, Mr Hancock said: Weaposre all working towards the best case scenario, weaposre all giving AstraZeneca and the team at Oxford, and the Imperial vaccine, every possible support, weaposre working with the other potential vaccines around the world, in America, and Germany, and the Netherlands. Weaposre working with them to ensure thatthey come off first, that weaposll get access to them here. But this is an inexact science and itaposs at risk. He said the most clinically vulnerable, such as the elderly, and healthcare workers would be the first to get the vaccine. Thataposs the principle set out by the independent committee who oversees these things, and on the clinical evidence, he added.

Prof Harrison said: “We have what we call a rising tide event rather than an outbreak. “By that we mean that we’ve got a number of cases rising in specic areas across a signicant community, but not a single big outbreak like other areas that had a workplace outbreak. “And when we look at the data what we can see is clusters in a part of the town, but the clusters are household clusters.” Big families looking after elderly relatives may be a factor in outbreaks but officials have warned against stigmatising certain ethnic groups. Around a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s , population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani heritage population. Blackburn councillor Saima Afzal said: “It should be a concern to anybodyany community is stigmatised and we know the facts are there, we are open about those facts.” “You go home and you are caring for a family member, or there are three or four families living under one household, because of economic reasons, or financial issues. “The Asian community do do that, they pool their resources together to help the whole family survive.

The Cambridge kids looked adorable in their little outfits as they were ushered into the church by their mum the Duchess of Cambridge. Unlike Kateaposs wedding to Prince William, the celebration was a private affair but well-wishers and members of the press were outside the church to see Pippa and her husband-to-be James Matthews arrive. While most people loved the excitement of the almost-royal wedding, the big day was a bit too much for some of the younger guests and little George got a tad upset. The Queenaposs great-grandson, usually the master of the polite smile and wave, broke down in tears after the ceremony at St Markaposs Church in Englefield, Berkshire, in . The poor little prince had already had enough as he left the church and was pictured pulling a face as he led the rest of the children scattering confetti in front of Pippa and her new husband. As they made their way over to the cars waiting to whisk them off to the reception, Kate turned to her son and gave him a stern telling off. It included the famous aposthataposs enough nowapos finger point, a universal hand gesture recognised by stressed mothers everywhere, and left George in tears.  According to the Daily Mail, he was in trouble after Kate spotted him purposely stepping on the train of Pippaaposs white lace Giles Deacon wedding dress. The little prince spotted Charlotte doing it, so decided to have a go himself. Oh dear... And the prince wasnapost the only page boy acting up, as one appeared to stick out his tongue and pull a dubious finger gesture - right under Kateaposs nose.  The bridesmaids on the big day were Countess Philippa Hoyos, Lily French, Avia Horner and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, with Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire, William Ward and Prince George acting as page boys. But allaposs well that ends well, as the young Prince soon appeared to forget his tantrum, and resume smiling sweetly and waving to the media as the cars drove the wedding party to the reception at the Middletonsapos family home. To the princeaposs credit, he played his role perfectly as he arrived at the ceremony, looking angelic as he prepared to walk down the aisle. Adorably dressed in a white shirt, green trousers and long white socks, big brother George even appeared to help his sister Charlotte carry her flower arrangement. But just before the ceremony got started, the Duchess was spotted shushing the children as they got a little too caught up in the buzz of the day. While this upset was short and sweet, itaposs not the first time heaposs had a wobble in public. Back in , he almost lost his cool at his sisteraposs christening, before a quick pep talk from his dad perked him right back up again. After the ceremony, the newly married couple took a short drive to Pippaaposs parentsapos home in the nearby village of Bucklebury, where staff were waiting to dispense champagne and canapes to the happy revellers. The evening do at the marquee at the Middleton family home was for adults only, with a five-course meal, drinks and dancing until the small hours.  Guests included royals Kate, William, Harry and Princess Beatrice, plus celebs including Made in Cha star Spencer Matthews - the groomaposs brother - and tennis ace Roger Federer.Keen not to steal the show from her younger sister, the Duchess wore an understated but very elegant outfit by Alexander McQueen, who designed her wedding dress back in ."},{"url":null,"title":"princess diana took charles cleaners","story":"NewsPrincess Diana took Charles to the cleaners in orce - but he had strict demandPrincess Diana and Prince Charles were separated for three years before the Queen finally told them to orce, and they signed the papers on this day in ShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video princess-dianas-speech-family-le-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news princess-diana-took-charles-cleaners-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The couple were  miles apart on July , , when they received the paperwork, and they spent the day very dferently. Diana was in London, where she had lunch with members of the English National Ballet before being photographed by the press. Meanwhile her soon-to-be ex-husband was with their sons Princes William and Harry at the Royal Familyaposs Scottish estate Balmoral. Diana, who wasnapost exactly short of cash as she was from a wealthy family, walked away from the orce a very, very rich woman with Charlesaposs former personal financial adviser saying she took him to the cleaners. She is believed to have received a lump sum of £.million as well as an allowance to run her private office, which looked after her charity work and royal duties. She was also allowed to keep living in her apartment in Kensington Palace. Geoffrey Bignell, who looked after the heir to the throneaposs finances for  years, told theat the time: Princess Diana took every penny he had.  I was told to liquidate everything, all his investments, so that he could give her the cash. He was very unhappy about that. Thataposs when I stopped being his personal financial adviser because he had no personal wealth left. She took him to the cleaners. Anthony Julius, the solicitor who represented Diana, urged the princess to give up her HRH title in a bid to get more money. She did this, but later regretted the decision.  According to Mr Bignell, many of Charlesaposs friends thought the figure was excessive. However there was one thing Charles drew the line at and said he refused to keep paying - her bills From September ,  of Dianaaposs favourite stores were instructed to start sending their invoices and tabs straight to the Princessapos home rather than Charles. The legal letter read: With effect from  September , any expenditure incurred by or on behalf of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales on or after that date should be invoiced directly to the Princess of Walesaposs Office, Apartment , Kensington Palace, London.  The couple have been separated for three years before the finally made their split official. The final decision came in the form of a handwritten letter from the Queen, which was delivered Diana via royal messenger just weeks after she gave her tell-all interview about the breakdown of her marriage. The one-to-one with Martin Bashir, broadcast in November , saw Diana sensationally reveal there were “three of us” in her marriage to Charles, in reference to his long-term love Camilla. Watched by .million viewers, she also described the prince’s camp as the “enemy” and said the monarchy was in desperate need of modernisation - causing huge embarrassment for the Royal Family.  And the tone of the Queenaposs letter left Diana in no doubt about her profound annoyance with the interview, which suddenly plunged the monarchy into crisis as the public sided with her. The Queen wrote: “I have consulted with the Archbishop of Canterbury and with the prime minister and, of course, with Charles, and we have decided that the best course for you is orce. Even though the couple had already been apart for three years, they hadnapost technically orced. Diana had already insisted she didnapost want a orce, and told Bashir of her “deep, profound sadness” about their separation and that she only needed “clarity on a situation that has been of enormous discussion.

But when she collected the bed and took it home she found it all broken. And after she contacted the page, they told her they would send a new one, before blocking her on Faceboook. Sophie, who has a two-year-old son, said she messaged the page privately to order the bed in response to their advert. She paid them a deposit of £ by bank transfer and then the other £ on collection two weeks later, on May . But after taking it upstairs at her home in west Hull, she found that the middle bracket needed to put the bed together had been ripped off the bed. She claims the slats were made of dirty, rough wood and there was not enough of them to support the mattress, which was only nine inches thick rather than , as she had ordered. Sophie, told HullLive: I had already paid but I took it upstairs and was trying to put it together but found it all broken. So I got in contact with them straight away and they said they would be in touch in the morning and have a new bed sent out to me that same day. But when I went to message them the next morning they had blocked me. So she said she then got a friend to enquire about a potential order to get a phone number for the business so she could complain via phone on May . She claimed they told her she could not receive a refund but that she would be given a new bed and that they would contact her again before the delivery date because they had to get the bed manufactured again. Despite a series of further unanswered messages to the number from Sophie, she received no further reply. She also notied them in June with a formal letter that she had referred her complaint to Trading Standards, but claims she has still heard nothing back.

Met Officeweather charts show plenty of warm weather and sunny skies between now and the end of the weekend - with the heat peaking on Friday afternoon.Previous forecasts had suggested Brits would have to wait until Saturday for Mediterranean highs, preceded by days of cloud and rain. Meteorologist Clare Nasir said Thursday will be a better day all around than yesterday outside of the northwest of the country, with highs of C and sunshine for many. North and southeast Scotland, northeast England, eastern parts of Wales and central southern England will be the favoured spots for seeing some sunshine. This will help temperatures up into the s, said Ms Nasir. While Friday looks even better, with BBC forecaster Darren Bett describing tomorrow as the peak of the heat for the next few days - with warm air bringing highs of C in London. However, he added that temperatures over the weekend are going to slowly ebb away due to strengthening wind and patchy rain - though Saturday will still see highs of C and Sunday C in the south.  The hot and dry weather wonapost be felt by all, with Ms Nasir warning a bank of rain and wind will arrive across western Scotland this evening, moving down across central Scotland and Northern Ireland. On Friday, she said: Many of us will see some brighter weather - it will feel warmer south of the rain band, with some sunshine coming through. That rain band pushes down towards the far north of England, [and] extends towards northern parts of Wales.  She added: Into the weekend it continues its passage southwards, with some fresher air to arrive in the north and also some sunshine. The Met Officeaposs long-range forecast has warned any sustained heatwaves are unlikely, however, until at least the middle of August. Temperatures sticking around normal with any warmer weather being short-lived, the report says of the period from July  to August .

Anna Wellinska of Armley, Leeds has been tormented and abused by a group of young people for two years.The youngest member of the group is just eight-years-old, Leeds Live reported.During the latest confrontation Anna decided to film the kind of abuse she has been receiving. At the end of the encounter she claims she was left bleeding from the head after rocks were hurled at her. The video shows the boys climbing over the gate, aggressively confronting her and refusing to leave. She is called a sla*per and one of the boys even thrusts his hips towards her and calls her a f***ing b***h. Anna has called the police numerous times but says the boys know they will not face severe punishment. She said: “After this stone attack I’ve been left afraid, my head hurts and I’m now having problems with my eyes. “Iaposve been living here since  and it was quiet and now weaposre afraid to go out into the streets, friends are moving out to better neighbourhoods. “Yesterday my partner just asked them to leave her car and they would start attacking. “We are tired of living in such a place. “We want to live peacefully without the windows broken in the cars punctured tyres. Another resident said they feared there would be a stabbing after one of the boys was spotted with a kne in his pocket. They said: If you say anything to them they get aggressive. “We’re scared of another stabbing might happen, one of the boys was seen with a kne in his pocket but this was two or three months ago.  “The kids know that they are too young to be arrested and that you cant give them a slap, and they can get away with it. They’re not scared of punishment, they know full well they do what they want and you can’t lay a hand on them.” West Yorkshire Police are investigating the incidents.

Oklahomaaposs Kevin Stitt said he had been diagnosed for the deadly disease as new infections in his state and neighbouring Texas surged by record numbers for a second straight day. But the -year-old Republican - who has backed one of the countryaposs most aggressive re-opening plans following lockdown - said he still respects peopleaposs rights...to not wear a mask. Speaking via video link from his home, where he is isolating, he made the bizarre claims that forcing people to wear masks would be dficult because they can easily slip down below your nose. The governor, who has regularly neglected to wear a mask himself, also received backlash this week after tweeting a photo with his mask-free children in a busy restaurant. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Texas, where the tally of known infections jumped by an all-time high of , cases statewide during the past  hours, also reported a record  additional Covid- deaths,i ts fourth such daily benchmark this month.But Oklahoma, which reported a daily record of , cases, became a focal point of the resurgent coronavirus outbreak after Stittaposs announcement. A staunch supporter of Donald Trump, he attended the presidentaposs indoor campaign rally in Tulsa along with thousands of others three weeks ago - where many didnapost wear masks.I got tested yesterday for Covid-, and the results came back positive, Stitt said in a video conference call with reporters.  I feel fine, really, I mean you might say Iaposm asymptomatic or just slightly kind of a little bit achy. The governor is one of a number of elected leaders infected since the novel coronavirus arrived in the United States this year. Others include US Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, and about half a dozen members of the US House of Representatives, from both parties. Stittaposs diagnosis comes amid an upswing in Covid- cases across the American South and West after state and local officials started loosening economic and social restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Across the country, new cases have been averaging around , a day.  Twenty-eight states have registered record daily increases in cases this month, many of them more than once, and  states have reported a greater number of deaths for a single day than ever before. Nationally, the total number of cases was nearing . million, by far the highest number of any country in the world, and more than , Americans have died from the highly contagious respiratory illness to date. Since Trumpaposs June  rally in Tulsa, attended by several thousand people against the advice of public health officials, coronavirus cases in the surrounding county have risen to over ,.  Thataposs a % increase over the last four weeks. The number of infections in several other Oklahoma counties have likewise doubled, tripled or even quadrupled over the same period. Eight staff on Trumpaposs campaign tested positive around the time of the Tulsa event. Stitt said he had worked with contact tracers when his symptoms developed and they believed he would not have been contagious before Saturday.  An influential mortality model developed by the University of Washingtonaposs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluationprojected late on Tuesday that the US death toll would surpass , by November , up , from a prior forecast. But it also said the number of lives lost could be reduced by ,nearly all Americans wore masks in public. Trump, whose popularity in opinion polls is declining ahead of the election, has been reluctant to embrace mask-wearing, and most Republican governors and local officials have followed suit.  With infections surging for a second straight day in Alabama and a record daily death total there, Republican Governor Kay Ivey on Wednesday reversed her position and ordered all residents to wear masks, starting Thursday. I always prefer a personal responsibility over a government mandate, Ivey said at a briefing. And yet I also know with all my heart that the numbers and the data over the past few weeks are definitely trending in the wrong direction. The neighbouring state of Florida, an epicenter of the latest surge in cases, on Wednesday reported another , new infections, putting its total at over ,.

Donning the face coverings to hide their youthful looks, they make a few adjustments to their clothing and hair and find themselves walking out of the stores with bags of drink, before posting the results on social media. The craze is sweeping the video sharing social media app TikTok as the teens exploit the coronavirus crisis to avoid being asked for ID for the alcohol. Multiple videos show underage drinkers applying white powder to their hair to mimic the greying locks of senior citizens and donning older-style clothes before dropping in on the liquor store. One even decided to don medical gloves to hide her youthful skin on her hands, while the mask covered her young face. Unsurprisingly, several video posts have gone viral, with some in the millions of views. Some describe the videos as apospranksapos but others were quick to point out it was illegal. On TikTok, one -year-old said she used baby powder in her hair and tucked some into a scarf to make her look aposmatronlyapos. Complete with sunglasses and face covering, she managed to buy a bottle of wine without being challenged. Excited, she tells her followers she is shaking.She added thatshe had been challenged to provide ID, she would have said I had forgotten it in the car and left the store. Another viral hit shows a girl of unknown age apply her costume in her bedroom before driving to a shop. Accompanied by pals, she puts on an OAP mask from a costume shop, with fake hair that covers her face.  Her mates film her secretively as she walks through the shop, mimicking the frail gait of an elderly lady. She emerges victorious with a shopping bag packed with tins of booze, as her friends laugh excitedly. While some have crazed the teens for their creativity, others point out it is illegal and that posting the evidence on social media might not be the smartest move.  In the UK, everyone will have to wear face coverings inside a shop nine days from now. The new rules, which come into play on July , are being welcomed by most in the medical community. If you fail to cover your face while visiting a supermarket or High Street shop you may be fined £.

In February  the woman made the journey and three months later married Obiaku. Sadly their relationship quickly fell apart, leading the husband to hold his we captive in a hotel for more than a year, Mba said in a statement.

The work would take around eight to  weeks which means that we could potentially be up and running by September.#Jim said that in the past the club have fallen victim every winter to weather conditions which frequently leaves their pitches unplayable for the entire season.The club applied for permission for a new state-of-the-art G pitch in , which was granted the following year.Jim said: #It has taken us a while to get this far and obviously lockdown didn#t do us any favours.#Let#s just hope we can move quickly before this winter season comes and we have the new pitch in place by then. We are now very anxious to get started on this as soon as possible.#If we can#t get started on the work very soon we will be into another winter season, and we will have lost our chance to get the pitch developed this year.#The club#s sports officer John Cairney said: #The pitch will be a massive boost for the community and will reach out to many of hundreds of local children  and will also provide a venue for all age and abilities.#The hub currently have  clubs under the banner of St James Community Club who would all  benefit greatly from the G facility. #He added: #The hub are also in the planning stage for creating a new cycling club for local participants, this again will help support with social isolation, and building new friendships.#We are also looking to attach a bike maintenance group.#A Dundee City Council spokesman said: #We will talk directly to the group about any issues they raise with the council.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that. It is definitely exciting times.”Former Rangers and Dunfermline man Clark was a key component of the Tangerines’ Championship title winning squad from last term.He is now hoping Mellon gives him and the other medal winners a chance to prove they can do it in the Premiership.Clark added: “The boys were excellent last season and we deservedly won the league although it wasn’t the way we wanted it to be.“At the end of the day we are champions and it is good to hear the manager will give us a chance.“However, we all know that he will bring in some new faces and over the next few days and weeks because he will want to strengthenthere are areas where he feels he needs to strengthen.“We will have to work hard and keep strivingwe want to keep raising the standards to meet the challenge of the Premiership week in, week out.”Clark ed from six months out with an ankle injury in a - friendly defeat at Motherwell on Saturday.It wasn’t the result the Terrors were after but the former Queen of the South man was just delighted to get back on the pitch.He commented: “It was a good run out. It has been a long time coming for me because it was my first game since January but it was good to get out there and going again.“It was exciting to be back playing again. I could have been backthe season hadn’t been cut short but this extra time has given me more opportunity to get everything % right and a good pre-season behind me.“It was a mix of experienced boys and younger lads but it was a good game.“We got beat - but at this stage it is all about fitness and boys coming through injury free.“The boys have all come back flying.

Is it not something we’d all love to do After months of lockdown, can you blame Brad A young lad as free as the wind who’s been cooped up and wants some excitement.Speaking as a -year-old mum-of-three aged six and under, my advice would be to do what you can while you can.You’re never going to regret the adventures you had – the places you travelled or the belly laughs shared with friends. Never.Well, I say Brad, who incidentally partied hard in the Balearics for a short period and is now back in Dundee, was as free as the wind.But that’s not quite right, given he had a girlfriend, who, having not heard from him for a while, texted to inquire as to her suitor’s whereabouts.She didn’t expect the selfie that came as a reply – Brad with his pal, taps aff with cat-got-the-cream pool-side grins.She promptly dumped him.Maybe the -year-old me would have done the same. But I can’t help but think not.It’s an age when you should be able to do your own thing before the responsibilities of providing for a family make your world a bit smaller.Before getting on a plane involves breaking your back with a car seat and pram, a bag of nappies and clothes not just for you but a squad of humans.In the here and now, my “escape” is a  minute drive, in silence or with tunes blaring, to Birkhill services and back to buy milk and bread while Jamie has the boys.I wouldn’t swap it for the world – but that’s got something to do with not missing out while I could.I’m glad of all the adventures I had when last-minute was an option.And I’d have lovedI’d done something as rock and roll as these plumbers from Dundee.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

When resources are stretched it’s more important than ever to be clear about our priorities and what services will need to change, reduce or stop altogether, in order for us to protect what’s most essential.#However, we are now entering a more dficult time where the true financial impact of the virus will become clear and dficult decisions will have to be made in order to work within defined budgets.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It’s a strange and unequal setup.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “These claims are simply not true. Dentists are now permitted, under our route map for dentistry, to offer routine treatment with the exception of aerosol generating procedures which continue to be available through our hub service for those in urgent need.“We understand that due to capacity issues and the build-up of people requiring treatment over the lockdown that practices will be prioritising their services for those most in need.“The health and safety of all patients and staff attending dental practices remains our primary consideration and in taking a phased approach we are seeking to balance the overall risk of infection with the needs of patients to be seen by dentists. Our overarching aim is to save lives.“As part of Phase  the Chief Dental Officer has commissioned an expert review of aerosol generating proceduresand will be writing to the profession shortly on how they might be introduced safely in practice.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The Argyll and Bute Climate Change group challenged me to make sure that I didn’t get into the habit of seeing this as a single issue but rather one that impacts absolutely everything I do at Westminster, from economic recovery planning, to defence and security, human rights and international affairs.#If there is a silver lining to this awful COVID- pandemic it is that going forward, we can do things dferently as iniduals, as a country, internationally and of course, globally. And its an opportunity we must take.#Mr O#Hara referenced the group and their meeting on the floor of the House of Commons the following day, when he asked the Secretary of State for Transport about the group#s dismay that #once again the UK Government had missed almost every one of on its emissions targets#.#We are very fortunate that our MP Brendan O’Hara understands the urgency of the climate crisis, and is open to some of our suggestions,# said -year-old Rowan Aitchison.He continued: #We desperately need to retire GDP as a measure of our wellbeing and work towards a system that allows people to live a fulfilling le. Scotland is one of very few countries that have made a start on this, pioneering a government system which is based on a wellbeing economy. We need to accept that money is not the key to human happiness, and start putting our wellbeing before increasing our profit margins.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPeople remarked on the freshness of the air.

However, this turned out to be much trickier than I had expected.He claimed: ldquoThe face masks available at that time seemed to be distributed by untrustworthy-looking websites, looked to be of poor quality, took weeks ndashnot months ndash to arrive and were extortionately priced.ldquoI realised that I couldnrsquot be the only person facing this problem, so I decided to stop moaning and take action ndash and #sasMASK was born.He explained that the #sasMASK is manufactured in Europe and complies with the latest material and layering guidelines for non-medical-grade face coverings.It has not only been designed to be washable, comfortable and affordable, but also comes in more than  designs, with this range due to double in size in the coming weeks, he added.With the wearing of face masks now compulsory on public transport in Scotland, Screen  Shield is expecting orders to continue to surge as Hass, now back at his home in Musselburgh, fulfils hundreds of orders there until he can open a warehouse.He said: ldquoA fundamental aim of the #sasMASK brand was to create a business model that also benefited charities that support frontline workers and community groups.ldquoIt seemed to me that ndash in a health crisis ndash anyone who was selling masks should be giving back to the community, and especially to those hardest hit.ldquoI set up Screen  Shield so that  per cent of all online sales go to NHS-related charities. But any participating community groups charities influencers buying masks for their network also receive  per cent of the sales value ndash as well as their members also receiving a  per cent

It was supposed to open last July, but that was delayed at the last minute over concerns for patient safety.A new opening date of August  was announced but that date is also now in doubt.These sorts of failures from the Scottish Government are all too common and Nicola Sturgeon should now match the Prime Ministerrsquos ambition, get Scotland building and finish these vital infrastructure projectswe are not to fall behind the rest of the UK.She has no excuse because thanks to the Prime Ministerrsquos announcement Scotlandrsquos capital budget is up by more than pound. billion.Another project which should be ramped up in speed of delivery, and would give a great boost to not just the East Lothian economy but also the whole Scottish economy, is the expansion of the East Coast Main Line.Locally, getting more local train services running from North Berwick and Dunbar, stopping throughout our county, to Edinburgh would not only create the potential for new jobs and take the strain off currently overburdened rail infrastructure but it would also be better for our environment, reducing the number of car journeys.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"hurrah-pubs-reopening---love-even-worst","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

The publican ndash dressed like a dentist of old, in a white lab coat ndash wordlessly poured his drink and shoved it towards him. When he began babbling his gratitude, and describing the arduousness of his passage over the hills, she cut him short. ldquoNobody told you to do it, she said.The British tradition of outrageously hostile hospitality stretches back long before Basil Fawlty. It seems some of us donrsquot merely tolerate curmudgeons behind the taps but actively enjoy being insulted. The title of Norman Balonrsquos memoir of his years as a Soho publican ndash Yoursquore Barred, You Bastards ndash sums it up. Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre.

Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty. So there.Read more: Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence But with an election in May, the UK Government would be ill advised to deny Scotlandrsquos right to exercise residual powers of devolution after we leave the EU.

Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of going too slowly she has been accused of going too quickly. She has been accused of simply copying actions taken by Downing Street and she has been accused of taking Scotland on a dferent path from that being pursued in England. She is damnedshe does and she is damnedshe does not. Things though must be pretty desperate for her criticsour First Minister is now attacked for her choice of personal protection. The letter by Dr Edwardssuggesting that for Nicola Sturgeon to wear a tartan face covering is somehow politicising the pandemic is frankly risible. He claims that she aspires to be some sort of \"super heroine\" on a mission to \"save Scotland\". What nonsense.There are two problems for Dr Edwards and his fellow-critics. Firstly he should read the Daily Update figures printed each day on Page  of The Herald. Here he will see the dramatic fall in the number of infections recorded in Scotland over the past weeks added to that the fact that at the time of writing, for the last five days there have been no deaths attributable to the virus. If he casts his eye further down to look at the UK figures. then he will see quite a dferent story. Frankly I find it depressing that the undoubted success achieved thus far by the Scottish Government working with our NHS and care workers in suppressing the virus is never acknowledged by critics such as Dr Edwards.The other problem for such critics is the fact that the steady, thoughtful, progress being charted through this pandemic by the Scottish Government, and so clearly articulated by Nicola Sturgeon, has won the support of the vast majority of Scots.There are more than enough examples of the failings of the UK Government to keep your correspondents busy just now. Your report in the same issue that since January of this year some , children have been admitted to English hospitals suffering from the effects of malnutrition is truly shocking. This scandal has now been followed by details of the new immigration policy for the post-Brexit UK . This will hit hard key Scottish industries such as hospitality, tourism and agriculture. Furthermore, it is a shameful way to treat the large numbers of our migrant care workers on whom we have come to depend, several of whom have lost their lives during this crisis.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I HAVE taken to summarising Guy Stenhouses articles, to save me reading them in future, and perhaps saving him from writing them.His summary of governmental responses to Covid  is: Scottish Government bad, Westminster Government good.He is right that patients were sent from hospital to residential care without Covid testing Business, July , but no one was discharged with symptoms.It was not known at the time that asymptomatic patients would spread the disease so effectively. The lack of a crystal ball was present throughout the UK and patients were discharged from hospitals in England in the same circumstances. Strange that Mr Stenhouse is not also asking for Matt Hancocks head on a plate.Its also unfortunate that Boris Johnsons announcement of compulsory face masks in shops came too late for his article. Otherwise, he could have pointed out that Nicola Sturgeon was again following the Westminster line, and that Boris had preceded her by at least minus  days.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.THE letter from your correspondent L MacGregormust be an attempt to break the world record for the number of exaggerations, deliberate distortions, misrepresentation and downright lies that can be fitted into a single missive. In a way we should perhaps thank her for her summing up of the tissue of mendacity upon which the case for Scottish independence so heavily relies.These range from the insistence on best-case scenariosto utter fantasyvia financial irresponsibilityto that good old favourite the Independence Time Machine , throwing in for good measure the wilful misrepresentation of the devolved fisheries border of  as an oil field border. The rest of the claims in the letter are also rubbish of the same order.The SNP has recently been advised by a tame academic professor of marketing to abandon facts and tell stories instead ndash a lesson learned from Donald Trump and Aaron Banks and his successful Brexit campaign . Its followers are obviously quick learners.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.AFTER the human misery and predictable economic failure of a partitioned East Germany, West Germany paid heavily for the reunication, investing billions into the East. If Scotland ever becomes independent and when it inevitably failsit can expect no such support from England because of the toxic anti-English rhetoric that is the default position of the economic theory-free zone of the nationalists. Broke and desperate, our future will for sure be as a recipient of ldquoaid from Moscow or Beijing. Can I suggest that even Boris Johnson is preferable to Putin or Xi Jinping John Dunlop, Ayr.IN response to Janice MacKay , Scotland was a country long before most of the present countries of Europe and for some centuries before the United States was cobbled together from the ious territories stolen from the inhabitants. Scotland is an inidual country just as England is, and the fact that it is shackled to England by an unfair Treaty of Union does not negate its existence as a nation. When devolution was eventually prised out of Westminster, some small elements of government were restored to Scotland in the hope that this gesture would prevent the natives becoming any more restless. It did not work.Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh EH.WE are currently bombarded in the media by the views of experts. My Chambers dictionary defines an expert as one who is skilled in any art or science.In his letter today , Douglas Cowe rightly places the word \"experts\" in inverted commas.After listing the supposed benefits of Scottish independence, L McGregor recommends that I read some of the work of true experts, whatever that means, like Dr Tim Rideout. Dr Rideout speaks, of course, in favour of an independent Scotland. Some \"experts\" lean to the political left, some to the right, some to unionism and some to Scottish nationalism.One can iniably find an \"expert\" who happens to suit ones own political leanings.Experts as defined by Chambers are, after all, human.David Miller, Milngavie.THE figures quoted by your columnist Kirsty Hughesto the effect that  per cent of Scottish voters ndash versus % in England ndash would wish to rejoin the EU seems to show that there has been little change in the disposition of overall electoral views regarding Brexit.However, it must lay to rest one belief held by some Remainers: that the narrow margin of victory for Leave in the referendum was due to the larger dferential turnout of elderly voters.Just over four years have passed since the referendum. Plenty of opportunity for members of this cohort to die off, especially since the elderly have been disproportionately affected by Covid-.Perhaps the desire to leave the EU is more widely dfused than previously thought.Christopher W Ide, WaterfootRead more: Former SNP MSP Dave Thompson to quit party to form new party, Alliance for Independence"},{"url":null,"title":"empty-offices-mandatory-masks","story":"The Daily MailRichard Littlejohn believes the lting of lockdown has not been lsquothe great liberation we were all hoping for.rsquoldquoSome of Britainrsquos biggest firms are refusing totheir offices to full capacity, he said. ldquoCompanies in the financial sector, including Barclays and Deloitte, will continue to let up to  per cent of their staff work from home.He said just a tenth of the , Goldman Sachs employees had ed to the office.ldquoThe City of London, the nationrsquos economic powerhouse, may not revert to normal until the New Year, at the earliest.

And anyone with serious breathing dficulties such as asthma is exempt anyway.Compared to England and the US - where there have been public protests against mandatory facemasks - hostility to the rule in Scotland has not been so pronounced, perhaps because we have less of a libertarian tradition.But among those who are opposed the same tropes emerge: dislike of being told what to dosuspicions that it might actually be harmful and scepticism of the evidence.What is interesting though, is that all this follows a well-worn template. Take seatbelts, for example.No one expects it to be routinely enforced by the police we do it because it could potentially save our own or others lives in a crash.But there was a time when seatbelts were considered controversial.The state of Wisconsin in the US was the first place to make front seatbelts a legal requirement in all cars built from  onwards.By then, there had already been fierce debate for  years that they might do more harm than good - for example, that they might cause internal injuries or make it more dficult to escape a vehicle which was ablaze or submerged in water. There were claims it would be safer to be \"thrown clear\".There were also arguments that wearing them should be a personal choice, not a legal mandate. Some car owners cut the seatbelts out of their cars in protest.: Slower exit from lockdown has had marginal effect on Covid infections and deathsAs recently as the s most Americans did not use them, and  per cent were opposed to them being enforced by law. As with muzzles for facemasks, seatbelts were depicted as tying up drivers.All this came against a backdrop of a landmark exposeacute in  - Unsafe at Any Speed - by consumer protection campaigner, Ralph Nader, which revealed car manufacturers reluctance to sacrice profits for safety features, despite mounting evidence around preventable death and injury.By the early s both the US and UK were finally making the wearing of seatbelts a legal requirement for drivers and front seat passengers. In, the law was extended in the UK to children in backseats, and to adults sitting in the rear from .Compliance among drivers and passengers is now well over % in Britain, with non-seatbelt wearers accounting for a disproportionate share of road crash fatalities - % in .Vaccination is another area of public health where the science around its benefits has become polluted by conspiracy theories and, of course, the persistent  claims of a link between MMR and autism.Some of the hostility is rooted in ignorance about the science, or scepticism about the motives of \"profiteering\" pharmaceutical companies. But it is also a simple dislike for \"being told what to do\".Immunisation is only effective in terms of creating herd immunityenough of the population comply. If enough people are vaccinated, a given infection has little opportunity to spread.: Why some scientists think handwashing and distancing might be insufficient to limit Covid spreadThat not only protects those who are immunised, but those with health conditions that make vaccination too dangerous. Nonetheless, making vaccination compulsory remains controversial - but sometimes its needed.Even in cases where the dangers are really not in dispute - such as passive smoking - it is hard to imagine that the elimination of indoor smoking would have been achieved without a legal ban.Like vaccination, unless enough people wear masks we wont see the benefit - and really, the purpose is to safeguard the most vulnerable whose own health perhaps might mean they cannot wear one.There is nothing to lose and, potentially, quite a lot to gain."},{"url":null,"title":"tourists-contract-covid-19-visiting-scotlands-rural-areas-should-isolate-are","story":"Yesterday, Scotlands hotels, pubs, restaurants and attractions were able to re-open indoors areas for the first time since lockdown ndash amid concerns many traders would not be able to restart their businesses during the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.In a bid to encourage Scots to help revive the devastated tourism industry, Visit Scotland has launched a television and radio campaign, calling on the public to make the most of whats on offer on their doorstep.Visit Scotland is urging Scots to travel close to home, rather than risk spreading the virus to remote parts of the country ndash highlighting the need for a sustainableto business for the tourism industry.:Scottish Government adviser warns SNPs lack of background in business could put jobs at riskWith some communities in isolated parts of Scotland fearful over a potential mass influx of visitors while the Covid- virus is still very much a threat to public health, tourism bosses are hoping to strike a balance between visitors supporting local businesses and being sensible with their actions.There have also been worries that tourists from England, where the prevalence of the virus is higher than in Scotland, could potentially spread the disease north of the border.

As the ferrys range reduced, the submarines officer of the watch altered course to avoid it.However, this turn was towards the ferry and reduced the time available for the submarine to keep out of the ferrys way, said the Marine Accident Investigatgion Branch report.With the sonar contact on a steady bearing, the submarines sonar team initiated a close quarters procedure - the commanding officer was also called to the control room.Based on the picture displayed by the submarines electronic tactical command system, the commanding officer intervened to cancel the close quarters move and ordered that the submarine remain at periscope depth rather than go deep to its safe depth.At about the same time, Stena Superfast VIIs lookout spotted a submarine periscope close on the port bow, and alerted the officer of the watch, who took immediate action to avoid collision.After taking avoiding action, the ferrys closest point of approach with the submarine was about  yards, which was unsafe, said the MAIB.However, the submarines commanding officer believed the passing distance to be about  yards, or four times the actual range.ldquoThis incident happened because the submarinersquos control room team overestimated the ferryrsquos range and underestimated its speed. This combination meant that the submarinersquos commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that might have appeared rational to them at the time but were actually based on inaccurate information, said the MAIB.ldquoTwo previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels show a similarity in that key decisions on board the submarines were made based on an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity. The Royal Navy has taken a series of actions in response to this incident, and previous similar accidents.As a result, the report made a safety recommendation to the Royal Navy to undertake an independent review of its actions taken to ensure that such actions have been effective in reducing the risk of collision between ed submarines and surface vessels.Andrew Moll, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents said: ldquoThe officer of the watch then took immediate and effective action, turning the ferry to avoid a genuine risk of collision with a submerged submarine.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions. In the meantime she is planning a busy year of events – both ‘virtual’ and ‘physical’ - so that members can continue to give Service while enjoying Friendship. Inner Wheel is an international women’s organisation with over  members in over  countries. It is one of the largest women’s service voluntary organisations in the world. Founded in , the key aims of the organisation are to promote true friendship, encourage the ideals of personal service and foster international understanding.

He was speaking during a visit to a newly established Contact Tracing Centre in Ballymena.The new centre, which opened at the start of the month, is an important part of the wider Test, Trace, Protect programme managed by the Public Health Agency. Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-. More information on testing is available on the PHA website.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ni to have more powers than scotland and wales in brexit plan","story":"Northern Ireland is to be handed more extra powers than Scotland or Wales under the UK Government#s plans for dealing with Brexit.PA Archive PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNorthern Ireland is to be handed more extra powers than Scotland or Wales under the UK Government#s plans for dealing with Brexit.By David HughesJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland is to be handed more extra powers than Scotland or Wales under the UK Government#s plans for dealing with Brexit. Measures that were previously regulated by the European Union willto the UK at the end of the year when the transition period expires. Responsibilities in  policy areas - including animal welfare, public procurement rules and environmental regulations - will now go to one or more of the devolved administrations.The way the Government is handling theof powers from Brussels has already provoked a row with Nicola Sturgeon#s administration in Scotland after it was revealed that Whitehall will assume control of the state aid regime. The proposed changes - set out in a white paper being published today for consultation - will see Northern Ireland receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in . As this could lead to dferent regulatory regimes in the UK the Government has drawn up plans for the internal market to ensure seamless trade between the home nations. At the heart of the plans are the principles of mutual recognition - so regulations in one part of the UK are recognised in all the other nations - and non-discrimination, providing a level playing field for companies across the UK. Officials said that without these actions a Welsh lamb producer could end up unable to sell their meat in Scotland, or Scotch Whisky producers could lose access to supply from English barley farmers. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: This plan is vital to protect jobs and livelihoods across all four nations of the UK. Northern Ireland exports more to the rest of the UK than to all of the EU combined - nearly % of Northern Ireland#s total external trade is with Scotland, Wales and England.We will be enshrining in law the UK Government#s guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses will benefit from unfettered access to the whole UK market. And we will implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way which safeguards the effective working of the UK#s internal market.Making sure that seamless domestic trade can continue will support our economic recovery, provide certainty for businesses and create more opportunities for investment across Northern Ireland.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesCoronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Health Minister Swann to recommend mandatory face coverings in shops as no further deaths reportedMy beauty business dried up in lockdown, so I built a log cabin to do treatments in my garden,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Face masks - will you be wearing them for a trip to the shops  Let us know your views in the comments.Posted by Belfast  on Wednesday, July , Those who did have their faces covered on the streets of the two cities on Wednesday afternoon were supportive of the move, including Monica Robertsfrom Loughinisland. It#s each to their own, but we need to start thinking about what the Government is saying, she said.I was quite dubious about masks at the start, but because I have medical issues I felt I shouldn#t put myself at risk.I#ve got into the habit of putting on a mask when I go out because I don#t want to be complacent about the coronavirus in case it comes back again in the winter. If everyone wore one it would give me reassurance that we#re all in the same boat and have to look after each other.

Photo by Peter MorrisonMark BainTwitterEmailJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFour months ago, the future looked bleak for Co Fermanagh beauty therapist Jeanette Guy.Having already been forced to pull the shutters down on her Flawless Beauty salon in Irvinestown, and with her other role at the spa in Lough Erne Golf Resort on hold due to Covid-, the prospect of losing the business she had spent eight years building up was very real.In the end the answer to her worries was closer to home than she thought and rather than sit back and let her salon dreams disappear she embarked on some new business-building of her own.let embedUrl  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .jstry .textContentembedUrl +  dart_gs_channels +  catchconst el  documentel.async  trueel.src  embedUrldocument.getElementByIdChildJust a few weeks later she#s taken working from home to a whole new level and completed her own fully equipped day-spa and beauty salon in her back garden.The beauty industry has been hit really hard by coronavirus, said Jeanette, who will be welcoming the first clients to her newly constructed business base this morning.I actually had to close down the salon a couple of weeks earlier than others as my severe asthma put me in the high risk category. I had to shield, so I just couldn#t work.For a while at the start it was very dficult to see a way back, she said.I bought a hot tub to cheer myself up at the start of all this as I knew I#d be spending a lot of time at home, but by Easter time, when there looked to be little prospect of getting back to the salon in the near future, I started to think about ways to try to keep the business going before it was too late.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJeanette Guy from Irvinestown turned a space in her garden into a beauty salon day spa.The log cabin was built fully equipped for all beauty treatments and a hot tub which is complimentary for clients.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJeanette Guy from Irvinestown turned a space in her garden into a beauty salon day spa.The log cabin was built fully equipped for all beauty treatments and a hot tub which is complimentary for clients.Photo by Peter MorrisonI started to think that maybe working from home was going to be the future for me.My kids, Sasha and Corey, were out in the garden, helping to tidy things up and paint fences. The space was there so I thought why not give it a go  It just seemed too good an idea not to try, said Jeanette.Jeanette#s boyfriend, Kieran Fee, by day a plumber based in Dublin, stepped in and despite neither of them having any real building experience, they took the plunge and set about creating a home-designed, purpose built log cabin around the hot tub.To be honest, we had no idea how it would turn out. Neither of us have done anything like this before, but we worked hard, roped in the kids to help and a couple of Kieran#s friends.Jeanette is just putting the finishing touches to her new spa, which also houses her own beauty salon, ready for the first clients to arrive.It#s exciting but I#m nervous too as you never know what people will think until you let them come in, she said.I#m lucky that I had built up a good number of loyal customers over the years and hopefully they will see the effort I#ve put in to keep the business going and continue to support me.We had no professional help, no contractors and learned as we went along. We started off with a base of  wooden pallets and just went from there, learning all the time, coming up with new ideas along the way.It#s a complete DIY job but I#m delighted with the way it#s turned out. I got exactly what I wanted.I#m always tempted now just to go in there and lock the door to have the place to myself, but as it#s separate from the house I can close the door on the business at night and walk away, eventhat is hard to do!Jeanette is again ready to offer the full range of day spa and beauty treatments, but admitted she#s still nervous about getting the business up and running again.At the start of this I didn#t knowit would survive, she said. Like so many more in the beauty industry the work just stopped overnight with no idea of when we would be able to get back to working again earning money again.I was terried in this first few weeks. I#m terried again but for a dferent reason. We#ve put a lot of hard work into this project and getting it ready to operate. Now the scary bit is seeingit takes off.But I think a lot more beauty salons will be looking at the option of operating from home in the future. It will be a struggle for all of them to survive after what has been a terribly scary time.Find out more about Jeanette#s Flawless Beauty at www.facebook Flawlessbeautybynetty   Belfast   Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesCoronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Health Minister Swann to recommend mandatory face coverings in shops as no further deaths reportedMy beauty business dried up in lockdown, so I built a log cabin to do treatments in my garden,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I find it so relaxing and the whole day can pass in a complete blur because I am so absorbed in their little world.These are very precious times when we can all be together and share the fun and noise.The birth of these two sets of twins to her two daughters factored in Marie#s decision to step down from her role as principal of St Mary#s - a post she has held for the past  years.She added: I would probably have been thinking about retirement because I have spent a total of  years teaching in St Mary#s and  as principal but certainly the arrival of the four grandchildren was a factor.

Recent events have exposed the fragility of the Executive by showing that it doesn#t take a scandal of the magnitude of RHI to blow devolution off course, he said.The repercussions of Covid- notwithstanding, meeting the commitments enshrined in New Decade, New Approach is the only way to restore trust in the devolution settlement and its ability to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland, who have been ill-served by stagnating public service provision for too long.All parties, the Executive, UK Government and Irish Government must work constructively to meet their commitments to forge a better future for Northern Ireland and to nurture healthy devolved governance. The UK Government must provide a realistic and long-term financial plan that recognises the challenges imposed by coronavirus.Mr Hoare stressed, however, that no amount of money can make the agreement work without the implementation of a more productive working culture at Stormont. To restore trust, the implementation of New Decade, New Approach will require regular monitoring and review, he added.The report also insisted that the stability of power-sharing rests on all parties# commitment to working within the spirit and the letter of the rules to maintain the devolved institutions. Meanwhile, it recommends that the Independent Fiscal Council, which is due to be established this summer to oversee the Executive#s revenue streams, should operate completely independently, as well as being adequately resourced. The committee is now urging all parties to focus on the needs of the people of Northern Ireland, who it says, have been ill-served by the Executive#s collapse.There should be no excuses for failure. We cannot sleepwalk into another Executive collapse, because the people of Northern Ireland deserve more, added Mr Hoare.

Trying to give comfort and help to folk in trouble. And again, it#s people from all backgrounds and faiths who come to me. Everybody#s problems are dferent but their needs for comfort, help, discernment and guidance are all equal.The MP adds that he has been given a practical day-to-day insight into the faith by his Catholic constituents.Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought Ian PaisleyWhat strikes me most is that they are unashamed and are never embarrassed about having a faith that promotes devotion and values family, children and le, he insists. These values are identical to my own beliefs. Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.Describing himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn, Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing.

That cannot be overvalued.He goes on to say that this is in sharp contrast to those who take the same stance in his own faith.As an evangelical Protestant I get tired by the embarrassment some of my faith have in declaring pro-le views, explains Mr Paisley, They say to me: #Yes, Ian, you might think that but you can no longer say it#, or #I agree with you, but we#ve just got to leave it with the Lord and realise we can#t do anything about it#.Frankly, that lack of faith appals me. Maybe it#s because I was brought up by a man of action that I just won#t let go. But I think it#s also the fact that my Roman Catholic constituents want a champion, even when the odds are stacked so decisively against us all on this issue.Stressing that he admires that loyalty and determined spirit, he also singles out anti-abortion campaigner, Bernie Smyth, who heads up Precious Le.She very happily signed my Westminster nomination on the basis of my pro-le credentials. I was moved by the fact that she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast, said the MP.Northern Ireland is a small place. That sort of public declaration doesn#t go unnoticed. The local parish priest also wrote to me before the last election. He told me he was openly urging anyone who would listen to him to support me because of these credentials. Then, in a practical way, the community put their money where their mouth is, sending me members to join my campaign team to put literature through doors and talk to constituents about the matter.That reminded me of why I admire my Roman Catholic friends.

We are confident that the device would have explodednot for the terrain it travelled over. We were unlucky this time but we only need to be lucky once.Mr Greene said the PSNI had investigated the movements of the officer#s car, a Jeep Cherokee, around Belfast on the days previous to the discovery and contacted gardai about the burning out of two cars nearby on June . One of the cars was a  southern-registered Skoda Octavia.Maps and photos were submitted in evidence by the prosecution.Counsel said that the trial will hear that the Octavia ended up in the yard of Mr O#Leary, a used car dealer, in May of , and that he is alleged to have altered the log book with an untruthful address.Outlining the case, Mr Greene said that Mr O#Leary will say that he sold the car to a stocky man, in his s for €.On August , , gardai arrested Mr O#Leary under the Offences against the State Act.Mr Greene read from the statement of the PSNI officer, who cannot be identied for safety reasons and is to be known as Officer One.Officer One said in his statement that he would usually check underneath his car but that because of builders at a neighbouring property he could not do it discreetly in the two mornings before the discovery.In his statement, Officer One detailed his movement in the Cherokee for May , May  and June  around east Belfast but said he did not note anything unusual.On Saturday, June , he drove to the golf course at .am, played golf and had a coffee. When ing to his car he saw the car next to his reverse, clearing his view of his own vehicle and allowing him to see the device underneath his car.With a clear view of the car, I saw what looked like a brown shoe box under my Jeep, in the shadow of the car and it appeared to be attached.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Creggan man, who plays for Stoke City, was in the news again this week when he criticised the reaction to sectarian abuse he has faced during his career in England. The Republic of Ireland player spoke out after a number of prominent footballers recently suffered racist abuse. While condemning the abuse,McClean criticised the football authorities, his Irish team-mates and the media over their response to racist and sectarian abuse he has suffered over the years. He is regularly abused for his decision not to wear a poppy. googletag.cmd.push Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination  McClean wrote this week on his Facebook page. He has received support fromSinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson who said more needs to be done to support the local footballer. “Its very sad that anyone would have to suffer such anti Irish racism in . I offer my support to James, Erin and their young family, she said. “Racism in any form must be challenged wherever it arises.There is no place for racism in soccer, sport or society. “I would appeal to those with influence within the sporting world to support James and his family. googletag.cmd.push “No person, in any walk of le, should have to suffer racial and sectarian abuse or intimidation. “It has been the case that James has been the subject of a witch-hunt and there has been avery vile campaign of hate against him across many s on social media.

Like many others, the  year-old Derry driver has had to wait later than planned to get his season underway with events being rescheduled due to the Covid- pandemic. Rally di Roma Capitale in Italy will now open the series next week. Having shaken the establishment on his R debut at this level on Rally Hungary last year where he took a podium finish, Devine is determined to show that that resultwasn’t a once off. “We’re really looking forward to this event”, said Devine. “Obviously it’s been quite a wait to get out competitivelyagain so little things like getting a test in the car last week and unveiling the livery all add to the build up morethan usual. The car looks great and I’m extremely thankful to all our partners. googletag.cmd.push We showed inHungary last year some of what we are capable of but this will be a very dferent challenge with a very strong entry. With a curtailed championship too it means more than ever we’ll have to on it from the word go.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Junior Driverprograms has kept him busy over the last number of months as the start of the season was delayed. “Being involved in those initiatives has been a great help at keeping focused over the last while andwill hopefully stand to me when we cross the start line”, Callum said. “At this level it can be thosesmall things that make the dference. Hyundai have also carried out a lot of development on the iR too and that will be great, not just for me, but for the competitiveness of the championship.” googletag.cmd.push Callum as usual, will be partnered by Brian Hoy and the Hyundai will be run by Irish rally preparation firm, PCRS. The all Irish team will also be entered officially under the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy banner making them eligible to score points in the ERC Teams Championship too. However,it’s another championship that Callum is eyeing up. “The ERC Junior Championship is undoubtedlyour focus this season because of the prize fund on offer, there aren’t many prizes like that in rallying.” Rally di Roma Capitale will begin on Friday, July  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just under km which and the event is operating a very strict Covid- policy, with restrictions on spectators as well as all registered personnel.

Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken.

By participating in the survey the public will help Council identy the issues that matter to users of its leisure centre and sports facilities. All completed surveys will be entered into a draw with a chance of winning a one month All Inclusive package once the leisure facilities are up and running again. googletag.cmd.push The deadline for completing the survey has been extended to run over the weekend until Monday next.

Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken.

There are also crew quarters for up to ten staff.The dining table can accommodate up to  guests and there is a separate bar and lounge areas.It even has its own inflatable flying boat and other toys include sailing dinghies, speedboats, ing gear and fishing gear, and lots more tucked away in its cavernous lockers.Athos spent several days at anchor in Strangford Lough last week and her presence certainly generated plenty of local interest,not from offers to purchase.She is on a long term charter and is currently cruising up the west coast of Scotland.Among the crew members is  year-old Melissa Ramm, from Donaghadee, who works as a deck hand.Her mum, Margaret, was lucky enough to get on board when Athos pulled into Antigua in the WestIndies back in March just before the Covid lockdown.ldquoItrsquos a stunningly elegant yacht, said Margaret. ldquoI would certainly have no problem living on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Book deals usually don’t happen to people like me  ","story":"NOTED for her flair for writing fantasy novels, a Ballynahinch woman is now turning her hand to crime stories after signing a rolling contract with a leading UK publisher recently.Kerry Buchanan, whose award-winning short stories and science fiction books have also been well received by the industries critics, is still in disbelief that her writing career is going so well.Kerry, who lives with her husband, Fraser, and their three grown-up children, Katrina , Lauraand Patrick , is also a full time carer to her  year-old father, Harold Matthews.Kerry, who only began writing shortly before she turned , says their family farm provides a lot of inspiration much welcomed escapism writing.Her crime novels - the Harvey and Birch series ndash will be coming to Amazon in the next few months.Since signing the initial three-book deal with Joffe Books, Kerry says that she feels blessed.ldquoWhen I wake up every morning, I go through the usual check list mdash arms check, legs check, book deal.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger.

We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley. Such a project will have the support of everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Kevin making waves in music scene with debut album  ","story":"FIVE years after taking up playing the guitar for the first time at the age of , local man Kevin Young is releasing his first album.Better known as the former owner of Saints Cafe in Saintfield, Kevin has found a new way in le through his music and career in working to help people deal with unresolved emotional trauma.His debut album, Lonely Demon, has already been hailed by BBC Radio Ulster presenter Ralph McLean as a ldquogreat collection of heartfelt, emotional and honest songs.Ralph has played several of Kevinrsquos tracks already ahead of the albumrsquos release on his Local Voices show.Kevin was one of the local performers who took part in the virtual Rock Down concert recently which raised pound, for the mental health charity Downpatrick PIPS.He is fast making a name for himself on the local music scene and already has amassed some devoted fans.Like many artists trying to get funding off the ground for a new creative project, Kevin opened up a crowdfunding appeal on Kickstarter. He raised more than pound, in just six days from funders, some of the subscribers coming from as far away as Australia.Kevin says that part of his journey into music is really about understanding what would give him joy in le.He explained: ldquoI now work as a professional practitioner of compassionate inquiry after selling up the cafe. Thatrsquos really about helping people improve their emotional wellbeing and to deal with any trauma-based issues they might have.ldquoWhen I was running the cafe, I would also do business consultancy and advise people on business aspects of opening a cafe. The more I did it, the more I realised that there was a lot of emotional problems that some people had which were holding them back and thatrsquos where they really needed some help. I began to study this type of psychotherapeutic approach developed by Dr Gabor Mateacute and realised that I wanted to do more. Tapping into his innate ability to connect with people and understand them also reawakened long-held creativity in Kevin and a desire to express himself.ldquoI often tell people that itrsquos never too late to do what you really want to do and change your le, he said. ldquoIrsquove always been into music but never got involved but I decided to learn how to play guitar when I turned  as I thought thatI donrsquot do it now, I never will. I also felt that I needed to practice what I preached.Over the years, Kevin has slowly emerged as a songwriter and has written some deeply personal lyrics to his alternative folk sounding album.ldquoThe songs are about issues such as addiction, darkness, depression, loss, lost love and death. The album is quite dark in them but Irsquove been told that people really relate to the music and words and find it uplting.One of Kevinrsquos earlier tracks released was Painted Son, which was well received.His first single off Lonely Demon, called I Love Only You mdash one of the rare love songs on the album mdash was written with his we Sharon in mind, who has lent her voice on backing vocals on all the tracks.The single is now available on the music , Bandcamp.Kevin has worked with music producer, Michael Mormecha of Tree Son Studios in Hillsborough, to record the album.Kickstarter funders will receive the album in a few weeksrsquo time ahead of its general release..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Martina guides pilgrims around St Patrick’s Way  ","story":"SEVEN people with a spiritual sense of adventure arrived in Downpatrick to walk the Saint Patrick Centrersquos new initiative, St Patrickrsquos Way mdash a pilgrimage route linking the seven sites in Downpatrick associated with the patron saint.Seven is said to be Godrsquos perfect number. ldquoItrsquos a good start, I thought, as I welcomed these brave souls. ldquoGuinea pilgrims, I called them light-heartedly. It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows. Teas were hurried made as the pilgrims, led by Elaine, looking like Rocky Balboa, triumphantly made their way towards the centre.ldquoIt was an amazing experience, declared the journalist who later said he had the energy to walk his love and woke up feeling refreshed. He loved it! Hillaryrsquos boots which had mounted Kilimanjaro started to fall apart on Slieve Patrick but she was rejoicing.The husband and we team from Belfast  ldquoAstounding, exclaimed Marion, joyfully, exhausted but glad to have made it. ldquoYou just need to tell people itrsquos longer, said her husband, Jim.The next dayrsquos pilgrimage, with a few adjustments, had everyone back at .pm.And Elaine and I received some lovely messages including one from Colette, graciously thanking us. ldquoWalking with you on St Patrickrsquos Way. It was an experience I wouldnrsquot have missed.We have  fully booked for July . Thank God! I was afraid I would have to move to Bangor to promote Columbanus.Martina Purdy, a former BBC correspondent and Adoration Sister, is now a pilgrim guide and public relations consultant for the St Patrick Centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th July 2020 Go Digital.jpg","title":"Ruairi signs deal with The Ports  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN striker Ruairi Croskery has signed for newly promoted Dankse Bank Premiership side Portadown.The  year-old has signed a two year contract at Shamrock Park ahead of the - season.Croskery spent four years at Manchester United and featured in the same Un- squad as current first team stars Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay.After his spell at Old Trafford he ed back to Northern Ireland to sign for Linfield.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today’s events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day.“I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe.“I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with us to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety.”Roger Gardiner, Orange grand secretary for Co Armagh, welcomed the PSNI acknowledgement of the efforts made to keep within the guidelines.“We did not expect anything dferent,” he said. “The only real events held by the Orange on Monday were really just a few members laying wreaths at war memorials across the Province. In Co Armagh we held a small outdoor event with less than  members who were all socially distanced.”The Co Armagh event took place at the Museum of Orange Heritage, Sloan’s House, Loughgall, on Monday afternoon.TUV leader Jim Allister also praised the handling of the Twelfth.“Many eyes were on the unionist community on Monday, ready to grasp any real or perceived breach of the regulations,” he said.“The reality is that they were left scrabbling around desperate to find something to complain about as the vast, vast majority heeded the Orange advice to have a Twelfth at home and celebrate responsibly.“The institution has provided tremendous leadership on this and I am delighted that the unionist community has responded so well. “Cancelling what is unquestionably one of the largest cultural events in Europe and foregoing generations of tradition was a big sacrice which deserves much wider recognition than it has received to date and stands in stark contrast to the actions of others in recent days. “While Stormont can no longer even give press conferences about the pandemic because the joint head of government blatantly broke her own guidance to honour a terrorist, there is no need for any Orange leaders to go into hiding.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfcbbbebfafc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbabbcaeecbaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.

In order for staff and guests to enjoy a safe cinema trip, Omniplex have implemented a range of new measures including: * Pre-Booking of tickets – to control the number of patrons in foyers and auditoriums, tickets need to be booked online. * In-Cinema Seat Separation – the system will dynamically lock empty seats around your booking so you can sit next to your friends but will be distanced from others * Limited capacity – they are limiting the number of guests at any time in the foyer and screen capacities will reduce by over % * Enhanced cleaning regimes – including screens and all customer touchpoints. Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of their cinemas * Reduced showtimes – only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. These policies will be adapted in line with official guidance. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex Cinemas said: We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show”. Excited cinema-goers will be able to book tickets online at Omniplex.ie  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aafddffabe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abcfffadadda   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
