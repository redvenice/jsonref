I used to have some people tell me, date someone for a year, get to know them and see them. I have had some really crazy relationships.\u0027And men over stepping their boundaries.

But the former diplomat ensured the talks were ‘friendly and constructive’.         The Prince felt forced to go public – in defiance of the Queen – to get his family to take his threat to walk away seriouslyHarry was presented with options and alternatives. Then, having been finally been given a clearer direction of what was wanted without the need to patch in Meghan by phone from Canada, the four were tasked with making the Prince’s wishes work, and fast. The offer on Frogmore helped the negotiations advance, and over five frantic days, the various incarnations of the deal were circulated in paper form and via encrypted email back and forth, with the HRH titles understood to be particular sticking point.The private secretaries and aides gathered yesterday morning at Buckingham Palace hopeful that Friday’s promise of an ‘imminent breakthrough’ could finally become a reality. By lunchtime, it was clear enough kinks had been ironed out of the ‘Megxit’ deal to go public.The Queen was alerted at Sandringham and a final draft of statements were circulated for remote sign off as far as Charles’s seat in Birkhall, Scotland.However some awkward issues around whether Harry will revoke his British residency, where he will pay tax and whether the pair will be allowed to continue using the Sussex Royal website have been kicked into the long grass.         There has been a growing row about who will pick up Harry and Meghan\u0027s annual security bill as they split their time between the UK and Canada (the couple are pictured last week)Courtiers insist that the pair will always be members of the Royal Family, but the use of the ‘royal’ moniker in a solely commercial enterprise is likely to become a running sore. The headache of who will pay for the pair’s security also remains answered.But it was decided these awkward details could be ironed out during a ‘transition period’ of the next few months into the spring – the start of the new tax year.Each private secretary spoke to their boss, and finally got the nod on Saturday afternoon, as spin doctors prepared to send the news around the world. A statement in the name of Her Majesty the Queen is a rarity, so to have two issued in a week shows just how devastating the impact of Megxit has been to her familyBut it was last night’s statement that revealed how long this saga has really rumbled on when it stated: ‘Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions’. Even ‘months’ may be an understatement, with the strain becoming evident even before Meghan and Harry walked down the aisle.In November 2016, Harry blasted the media’s coverage of his new girlfriend, and particularly ‘the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments’. And over the years there were hints about Harry’s discomfort about being a member of the royal family.It had been hoped that giving the Sussexes’ their own Royal Household last year would give Harry and Meghan the freedom that they wanted.But their plans to establish their own independent ‘court’ at Windsor was thwarted by the Queen and Prince Charles who jointly agreed that the household should remain under the auspices of Buckingham Palace.The couple have also faced public criticism, such as the news in April last year that £2.4 million of taxpayers’ money had been spent renovating Frogmore.Then a group of Meghan’s closest friends gave anonymous interviews to People magazine in the US alleging that the negative publicity had put the pregnant Duchess ‘under a level of emotional trauma’ and suggesting she had had to endure ‘lies and untruths being written about her.’In an ITV documentary last October, filmed during a visit to Africa, she revealed that she had tried to adopt the ‘stiff upper lip’, saying: ‘Not many people have asked if I’m OK’ in an apparent swipe at her royal relatives.And Harry spoke about the rift with his brother, saying that he and William were ‘certainly on different paths at the moment’ while insisting that: ‘We’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers. I love him dearly’.Yesterday’s deal caps 20 months of bitterness, with Palace insiders hoping this move will actually bring the brothers back together.Indeed the pair could come face to face tomorrow as Harry is expected to take part in one final Royal duty before joining his wife and son in Canada, The Mail on Sunday has learnt, at the UK Africa Investment Summit.However there is anger that Meghan will not be joining him as planned as part of the major drive for post-Brexit trade championed by three Government departments.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will host a reception at Buckingham Palace on behalf of the Queen, and it is understood that the Duke of Sussex will take part in a private event during the summit.A Government source said: ‘Harry and Meghan were meant to be the star turn but obviously that has gone down the pan.’With a transition period to ease them out of public life, there will be plenty of changes needed for the Sussexes in the coming months –starting with removing ‘their HRHs’ from the Sussex Royal website. "},{"url":null,"title":"China reports 17 new cases mystery virus","story":"Share this articleNews  Wuhan Coronavirus | Faculty of Medicine | Imperial College LondonNew Chinese virus \u0027will have infected hundreds\u0027 - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Medical student 27 puts neurology degree hold high class escort","story":"Share this article While travelling, Jake can see between three to eight clients a day, ranging in age from 20 to 70.He recently deferred his studies in the medical field to pursue escorting full time but he\u0027s not putting his dreams on hold forever.\u0027There is a part of me that fantasises about continuing my degree or changing degrees into a different realm of anatomy and physiology but I do hope I can go back… and I don\u0027t mind thinking I\u0027ll be a mature student when it happens,\u0027 he said.Despite perceptions of sex work, the type of work Jake does can be as basic as a coffee and a chat - rather than purely physical.Even though he believes sex work is becoming more accepted, Jake has chosen to remain anonymous, obscuring his face in all his images online and creating a fake name and persona.

Eisenstaedt was experimenting with a new Leica camera that allowed him to do away with much of the clunky paraphernalia of his craft. That night, at the gala premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov’s The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, he was looking for a way to find some intimacy among the theatre’s grand architectural curves.Scanning the boxes in the upper tiers of the opera house he saw a young woman whose attention to the progress of the Russian epic on stage did not seem absolute. Better still, the box next to her was empty. Eisenstaedt was an unobtrusive man, only 5ft, and he inveigled his way into the empty box and got his shot. “Without the girl there would have been no picture,” he said.A couple of years later, this was one of the images that persuaded a new magazine called Life, in New York, to take on the German-born Eisenstaedt as one of its first four staff photographers. Having photographed Hitler and Goebbels (the latter scowled into Eisenstaedt’s lens on discovering he was a Jew) he had left Berlin for the US in 1935. Among the 2,500 photo stories he published in Life in the next four decades was perhaps the most iconic image of the end of war: a US sailor kissing a young nurse in Times Square on VJ Day.Eisenstaedt died in 1995, aged 96. His La Scala picture is included in a new exhibition devoted to modernism in photography since the first world war. Eisenstaedt was the least austere of modernists. “People don’t take me too seriously with my little camera,” he once suggested. “I don’t come as a photographer. I come as a friend.”Breaking Away: Modernism in Photography since World War I, presented by Michael Shapiro Photographs and Richard Nagy Ltd, is at Richard Nagy gallery, London W1, 6 February-27 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c4286ab4028684370d86bc5e4cd2812dbacc04a/0_480_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5c4f26221cdc718ad4f537f1115c61","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The erupting Taal volcano, bushfires in Australia, airstrikes in Syria and unrest in Lebanon – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30f566c9bb76de08b334bcf021cb504a1918440/1452_1226_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a8fcba4e82f358b43d8bb2e48c18c39","title":"the magic of mushrooms in arts in pictures","story":"“I noticed so many artists working with fungi,” says curator Francesca Gavin, “I wanted to learn why.” This has led to a new Somerset House show, Mushrooms: The Art, Design and Future of Fungi (30 January to 26 April), a 130-year cultural history featuring artists and designers including Cy Twombly, Carsten Höller, Beatrix Potter, Tom Dixon and Takashi Murakami. “I want people to leave the show inspired by fungi,” Gavin says, “and with a little more knowledge of their importance to the planet’s survival.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16ff6eca7df464c60bfa1d87f1388b80249c8ae2/0_775_3753_2252/master/3753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0373bf7caa406a5b9d27b512311ab41b","title":"why world needs new politics happiness can we be happier evidence and ethics richard layard","story":"In this extract from his new book, the UK’s happiness tsar argues for wellbeing as a political goal as well as a personal one• Read our interview with Richard LayardWhoever is happy will make others happy too... How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world. Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young GirlThere is a wind of change in our society. People are talking about feelings. Even men are doing it. Relatively recently Prince William and Prince Harry talked for the first time about their mother’s death and how it affected their own mental health. All around there is a new undercurrent – a greater concern with our own inner life and with how other people feel. A new, gentler culture is emerging.By contrast, the older culture, which still dominates, is altogether harsher. It is more focused on externals. It encourages people to aim above all at personal success: good grades, a good job, a good income and a desirable partner. This culture of striving has brought many blessings, and life today is probably as good as it has ever been in human history. But that culture also involves a lot of stress, and people wonder why – if we are now so much richer than previous generations – we are not a lot happier.The answer is surely the ultra-competitive nature of the dominant culture. The objective it offers is success compared with other people. But, if I succeed, someone else has to fail. So we have set ourselves up for a zero-sum game: however hard we all try to succeed, there can be no increase in overall happiness. An alternative, gentler culture offers a different aim, which can lead to a win–win outcome. It says that we should of course take care of ourselves, but we should get as much happiness as possible from contributing to the happiness of others. Competition, it argues, is valuable in the right context – and that context is competition between organisations. This has been a major engine of progress. But what we need between iniduals is mostly cooperation, not competition. We want people who will act for the greater good – at work, at home and in the community. This produces better results for everyone. But above all, it makes life more enjoyable. For people long to relate well to each other – as an end in itself and not just as a means to something else.My main proposal is that we should each of us, in all our choices, follow the Happiness Principle: we should aim to produce the greatest happiness that we can – and especially the least misery. This noble vision does not go against basic human nature. For all of us have two inherited traits – one selfish and one altruistic. The selfish side believes that I am the centre of the universe and my needs come first. This trait was important for our survival as a race, and we should indeed take good care of ourselves and of our own inner equilibrium. But the altruistic side enables us to feel what others feel and to strive for their good. This is vital for a happy society.It is a fallacy to think that reputation is a sufficient motivation for good behaviour. We need people with an inner desire to live good lives, even without reward. A happy society requires a lot of altruism, and so it needs a culture which supports our altruistic side. This gentler culture has always been around, in some form or other. It is there in all the great religions. Yet for many people these religions have lost their ability to convince. As religious belief has declined, a void has been created and into that void has rushed egotism, by default. We have told our young people that their chief duty is to themselves – to get on. What a terrible responsibility. No wonder that anxiety and depression are rising among the young. Instead, people need to get out of themselves – to escape the misery of self-absorption. So there has to be a new, secular ethic, based on human need and not ine command.This basic secular ethics goes back to the 18th-century Anglo-Scottish enlightenment, which proposed a radically new goal for society. The goal, it said, should be the happiness of the people. That Happiness Principle was, I believe, the most important idea of the modern age, with powerful implications for how we should live and how our policymakers should act on our behalf.This principle inspired many of the great social reforms of the 19th century, but it was soon challenged by philosophies that glorified struggle. Such dreadful philosophies contributed to two world wars and to the ultra-competitive features of today’s dominant culture.But now the Happiness Principle is making a comeback. There are many reasons for this. One is disillusion with the dominant culture and the stress which people experience at every level of society. But the other reasons are hugely positive. Now, for the first time, we have a science of happiness, which gives us real evidence on how to create a happier society.At the same time there are new techniques of mind-training that enable each of us to improve our own inner mental state, with evidence-based ways in which all of us can become happier. And more and more people now use age‑old eastern meditation to achieve greater contentment and calm of mind.These techniques offer the prospect of a society where we take care, more than ever, of our own inner contentment and, especially, the happiness of others.There are two opposing strands in human nature. One stresses the differences between my own needs and wants and those of others. The other stresses the similarities and what we all have in common. The relative strength of these two influences is determined to a large extent by the prevailing culture in which we live.It is easy to see how the Me-First philosophy can take root, unless constantly challenged by a more unselfish view of the purpose of life. After all, we mostly live in large cities in which no one has any automatic position. To do anything worthwhile you have to establish your position, and this requires an element of self-promotion.In recent years, the rise in competitiveness has been made much worse by the advent of social media, which have encouraged self-advertisement and made more young people feel inadequate, anxious, depressed and “left out”. In addition it has encouraged populism, which is an increasing challenge to a cohesive and loving society.None of these trends will be easy to alter. But there are many hopeful trends too, both among citizens and among policymakers. The first is the spectacular fall in crime of all kinds in recent decades in most advanced countries. This new degree of gentleness is one of the least noticed and least well understood changes of our time, but it is deeply significant. My own guess is that it reflects the increased influence of women in our society: women commit fewer crimes than men do, and they tend to avoid men who are criminals. Moreover, most women care more about inner feelings than men do on average, while typically men have been more focused on externals.This shift of perspective is central to the happiness movement, which is about the overarching importance of our feelings – our quality of life as we actually experience it.A third trend is the growing toleration of ersity. That has already transformed the happiness of minority groups, including people who are LGBT, disabled or (until recently) immigrants.So the ground is fertile. But are our leaders up for implementing the Happiness Principle?One hero in the political sphere is Enrico Giovannini, an enterprising Italian who was once the chief statistician of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD is the club of rich nations, and it started the standard measurement of GDP in the 1950s. In 2004, Giovannini persuaded the OECD to open a public debate on the nature of progress – the issue often referred to as “Beyond GDP”. Since then the OECD has held another five major conferences to “push forward the boundaries of wellbeing measurement and policy”. In 2012, it recommended that its member countries should measure the subjective wellbeing of their adult population each year, and all of them now do so.The UN too has been active. In 2012 it established an annual International Day of Happiness (20 March), and the UN general assembly called upon its members to give more attention to the happiness of their people. At the same time a leading development economist, Jeffrey Sachs, who was an adviser to the UN secretary general, proposed the idea of an annual World Happiness report. This is now presented each year at the UN. But what are inidual governments doing? In January 2019, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, was addressing world leaders at Davos. She announced that her government had adopted wellbeing as its goal and would use it as the basis of her budget for wellbeing the following May.Many other countries, local governments and cities have been taking steps in the same direction, including the governments of France and Britain. In 2008, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, set up a distinguished commission to report on the measurement of progress, and following on from that, French law, like that of Sweden, now requires that all major policy changes must be analysed for their impact on (among other things) wellbeing.Britain has in many ways gone further than this. It was the first country to measure national subjective wellbeing as an official statistic, and its top civil servant for many years, Gus O’Donnell, pushed for subjective wellbeing as a goal of government policy. After leaving government he chaired a committee that produced the best available account of how that might be done.The movement for change is strong. Governments make the decisions, responding to a growing alteration in the public mood. But can each one of us become more effective as creators of happiness, both as citizens and within our own occupations? Who can do what? Here are a few examples, all of them based on the new science of happiness.In 2015, the Dalai Lama was in London launching a new course, Exploring What Matters. At one point a woman came on to the stage. She was in pain and on crutches. For years she had been mostly bedridden and often depressed. But then she enrolled on the course. It changed her life. She realised that, by helping others like herself, she could give meaning to her life. The Dalai Lama embraced her. Later on, he was asked: “What is the most important thing for a happy life?” Without hesitation, he replied: “Warm heart.”In the end it is each of us as iniduals who will determine the levels of happiness in our society – by everything we do. It is not easy to live well, but it is very much easier if you are in regular contact with people who are trying to do the same. In the west this used to happen when people went to church. They were reminded that there was something bigger than them. And they were inspired, uplifted and comforted. But today people are much less likely to define ethical behaviour as conforming to the will of God.That is one of the reasons why, in 2011, we founded Action for Happiness, a secular movement for a happier society. The patron is the Dalai Lama, and members make the following pledge: “I will try to create more happiness and less unhappiness in the world around me.” So far, more than 150,000 people from 175 countries have made that pledge – promising to live according to our ethical principle. Action for Happiness offers them 10 Keys to Happier Living, and it is forming thousands of groups worldwide who meet regularly to inspire each other, using standard materials which the movement provides. The 10 Keys are presented as an acronym (Great Dream) and ided into five day-to-day actions and five “habits of mind”. The daily habits are Giving (doing things for others) Relating (connecting with people) Exercising Awareness (living mindfully) and Trying Out (learning new things). The philosophical habits are: Direction (having goals to look forward to) Resilience (finding ways to bounce back) Emotions (looking for what’s good) Acceptance (being comfortable with who you are) and Meaning (being part of something bigger).A new culture has to be based on iniduals – what we each value and how we behave. We need to address the moral vacuum which has been left by the retreat of religion. Where egotism has replaced it, we need instead the generous philosophy embodied in the Happiness Principle. And to live well, we need to cultivate the positive side of our nature which can nourish us and help us reach out to others. For many people it will help to belong to a community of people who share our outlook. Together we can build a happier society and each of us will contribute in our own unique way. Sceptics question whether teachers can make children happy. But the evidence shows that they can. Since 1991, children born in Bristol have been followed up each year to see how they are faring. For example, the researchers measured their happiness at age 16 and, to explain it, they collected information about the children’s parents, as well as about the primary and secondary schools they attended.What they discovered was remarkable. How happy children are at 16 depends as much on which secondary school they are at as on everything we know about their parents. It is also profoundly affected by which primary school they attended, all those years earlier. So schools make a huge difference to children’s happiness at 16. They also have a significant impact on their behaviour. In fact they make about as much difference to their happiness and their behaviour as to their academic performance. And so do inidual teachers. In primary schools children are mainly taught by one teacher over the whole school year, so that in the Bristol survey we can trace how each teacher affected the happiness of the children in their care over the year. We found that the teacher made a greater difference to the children’s happiness than to their performance in maths.Remarkably, we can also see the long-lasting effect of inidual primary school teachers on the children they taught right up to the age of 20. But how well, one might ask, does a child’s happiness predict her subsequent happiness as an adult? Or shouldn’t schools concentrate mainly on “what they do best” – academic learning? The answer is a clear “no”. For the best predictor of a happy adult life is a happy childhood. Evidence also shows that happier people learn better. And they contribute more to the happiness of the world.Schools and universities can become society’s secret weapon for improving our culture. For the best outcomes, five things are needed:Teachers can do a lot. But when their students eventually go out to work, will their managers offer them an environment which fulfils or disheartens them?The Nobel prize laureate Daniel Kahneman has pioneered the study of time-use to find out which times of day are happiest for people, and the answer is quite shocking. The worst time of day is when you are with your boss. The person who should be inspiring you and appreciating your work makes you feel lousy. There must be something deeply wrong with our philosophy of management. Another depressing finding is that most people don’t much like their work – compared to almost anything else they might be doing. This is not of course true for everybody. But for the average American citizen it is just that, and the same has been found in Britain. There are clear, evidence-based methods that improve happiness among employees. These include giving workers more influence over how their work is organised, paying team workers on the basis of team, not inidual, performance, measuring worker wellbeing, appointing managers who can inspire and lead, running courses on wellbeing at work for all workers and taking mental illness seriously, with managers who can spot it and get the necessary help. Firms that do these things will gain both higher productivity and greater profits. And they will make the world happier.There is currently massive discontent with the world’s elite, and with the atomistic neoliberalism that it often espouses. According to that philosophy, all will go well if iniduals are free to negotiate their own way through life selfishness is not a problem provided people can choose their own friends and trading partners. But this ignores one key fact – that we would all be better off if the pool of possible friends and traders were nicer and more honest. The attitude of other people is crucial.For this reason, there is now a strong push back against extreme liberalism. People are calling for a society based on “reciprocal obligation”. In this view, we do not enter this world as independent, fully fledged adults, but as people highly dependent on support from our family, our government and the whole of our society. In return for this, we should ourselves feel bound to help others when we can. We want a free society, but one where people feel a duty to help.It is the vision of society that politicians should champion, and it is the principle that should guide their priorities in government. It is also the principle that will get them re-elected. So the aim of politicians, as of private iniduals, should be to create as much happiness in the world as possible and as little misery.The quality of the government has a huge impact on the happiness of the nation. Ministers should plan long-term, use evidence from past experience, avoid unnecessary reorganisations, and resist witch-hunts. Power easily corrupts, so we are right to scrutinise our politicians. But this scrutiny, like everything in life, should be sensible. If honest mistakes are allowed to wreck careers, we shall not get good people to go into politics. Politicians should be judged more by the amount of good they do, than by the number of mistakes.As we become richer, the size of government is bound to grow. This applies to the traditional roles of the state, such as education and physical health care. But it is also because the public now demand help with mental health, addiction, domestic violence, child abuse and loneliness – not as a nanny state but as a state that helps people to help themselves. Finally, the big threat for the future is populism and the politics of ision. So we have to regulate social media, limit the power of private money in politics and expand state funding of parties.Will the happiness revolution succeed? I believe it will. There is no reason why, in less than 40 years from now, the culture of gentleness could not displace the dominant culture of excessive inidualism. The world happiness movement can indeed bring in a better, gentler culture and do it fast. But what happens will ultimately depend on each one of us. We can all be heroes in the happiness revolution.• This is an edited extract from Can We Be Happier? Evidence and Ethics by Richard Layard with George Ward (Pelican, £22).

It is expected to argue that the DfT mismanaged the bid process with regards to the Railway Pension Scheme, where a £7.5bn deficit has been identified by the regulator, and was attempting to shift too onerous a responsibility on to private firms.The litigants, which also include Stagecoach’s bid partners Virgin and SNCF, and the rival firm Arriva, claim that franchising contracts, which make the operators responsible for pension liabilities, pose an unacceptable level of risk, whether through strikes or financial collapse.Although the DfT has said there are mechanisms to mitigate the risk, operators fear they could be landed with a huge bill to close the pensions deficit, on relatively low-margin rail contracts. Existing franchises are already seen as precarious, with warnings that South Western and others may have to be renationalised, following the collapse of the Stagecoach-run Virgin Trains East Coast franchise in 2018 after the firm lost around £200m.Any alterations to rail pensions – a final salary scheme that remains open to new entrants and is payable at age 62 – would be fraught politically, with unions threatening a national strike should the current scheme be modified. Following earlier warnings of action from the RMT, the TSSA union wrote to train operating companies last week saying: “The pensions scheme is off the table … or a national rail strike is very much on the cards.”Should the train operators succeed in their high court action, and have their franchise bid disqualification ruled unlawful, they could be awarded compensation. The sums sought would cover bid costs and possibly loss of earnings on three affected franchises – SouthEastern, East Midlands and West Coast.The outcome could potentially lead to the two completed franchise competitions being declared invalid, after the awards to Abellio on East Midlands and First-Trenitalia on West Coast, posing fresh headaches for the government.DfT mandarins are expected to be cross-examined, including the highest-paid civil servant, Peter Wilkinson, the architect of recent rail franchises, who declared in 2016 that the government was ready for the battle with unions that the franchise contracts would provoke.A Stagecoach spokesperson said: “We believe in a rail system which is focused on delivering the best services for customers, is financially sustainable and has the confidence of the public. It is disappointing that we have had to resort to legal action however, we believe there are important issues to be determined by the court and we have a strong case.”A DfT spokesperson said: “We do not comment on legal proceedings. However, we have total confidence in our franchise competition process and will robustly defend decisions that were taken fairly following a thorough and impartial evaluation process.”The hearing is expected to last around four weeks in the high court, with a judgment following later this year.Rail pensions are a growing issue for the industry and government, although the franchising system is likely to be reformed. The government-commissioned Williams review into the future of the rail industry is due to report soon, and the chairman Keith Williams has already said franchising no longer works in its current form.

The talks surrounding the agreement have been tortuous, leading to fears that the world could be caught up in a trade conflict between these two economic giants. The signing showed there is space for compromise as well as confrontation in dealing with China, but the negotiations illustrate the difficulties of dealing with a US that has embraced economic nationalism and a China whose markets are still restricted in many important areas.Nonetheless, as Britain prepares to leave the EU, there has been a resurgence of interest in the possibility of a major UK trade deal with Beijing. Just days after the 2016 referendum, the incoming Brexit secretary, David Davis, declared that “trade deals with the US and China alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU”.Few developed economies have a full free trade agreement with China, and those that do, such as Australia and Switzerland, usually have some particular product (minerals, specialist machinery) that makes such a deal attractive to Beijing. Instead, many countries have done bilateral, less comprehensive deals that cover only specific areas. The EU and China have been discussing a comprehensive FTA for years, but issues such as Chinese infringement of intellectual property rights has slowed down progress. The UK doesn’t have one obvious sector that China sees as of compelling benefit to its own interests, so a deal is unlikely to be agreed quickly.However, this provides an opportunity for the UK to think carefully about what it wants from such a deal – and, just as important, how compatible it might be with future plans to trade with the US and the EU. The country may soon be forced into difficult choices.At the moment, the government seems to be concentrating on a trade deal with the US, with its potential effects on NHS drug pricing or chlorinated chicken. But the US has another priority: to constrain the growth of China’s economy as far as possible, particularly in areas such as tech. The new US-Canada-Mexico trade agreement has a “poison pill” clause, which would allow the US to pull out if either of the other two countries signs a trade agreement with a “non-market” economy such as China. The US is likely to demand a similar clause in a US-UK agreement.Separately, in a more urgent decision, Washington is demanding that the Chinese firm Huawei is ruled out of bids to supply the UK’s 5G infrastructure. But if the UK agrees, it can expect an angry response from Beijing. At the moment, there are signs that the government will try to adopt a compromise position, allowing Huawei to bid for “non-core” infrastructure. Yet that runs the risk of satisfying neither the US nor China, rather than both.The EU is also currently having its own debate about Chinese investment. In the past few months, Germany has become increasingly wary of the security implications of Chinese 5G technology. So the UK will shortly face a dilemma – if there is a split within the EU on how to engage with China, will we stay closer to the China-sceptic or the China-friendly parts of the continent?Decisions of this sort make it an urgent priority to develop a deeper understanding in Britain of China and its thinking, including its very different political and social system. In the short term the UK should concentrate on strengthening sectors that already have a strong reputation in China, such as education. The UK is the top destination for Chinese university students after the US, bringing both income and an opportunity to promote the liberal, pluralistic values of free research and enquiry to China’s emerging elite.An eventual trade deal is possible but it depends on immensely skilled diplomacy as Britain weaves between the US, EU, and China. It will also require making a strong case to China that concessions to Britain, such as greater access for British financial and legal services, are worthwhile, while making a clear case at home that a deal with China will create tangible prosperity without compromising liberal values. A deal in exchange for pressure on politicians or the press to avoid discussion of issues such as the importance of maintaining judicial independence and a free press in Hong Kong would generally be considered too high a price.In 2016 Davis argued that after Brexit, Britain should provide “an 0800 number that a small specialist manufacturer in the north of England, say, could call for practical help in Shanghai”. The infrastructure and knowledge base that would be needed for such a phone number to be feasible is still in its infancy. Developing it won’t be quick or easy. The challenge for advocates of “global Britain” is to now demonstrate that their confidence in acquiring new markets is not just bluster, and that they can draw the UK closer to a far-off economy about which we still know too little.• Rana Mitter is director of the University of Oxford China Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f7bf8de4d67b74a8941453f2be089bc98023d5/0_2254_2705_1622/master/2705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ecbaa7137412c45505703cb5031e289","title":"the guardian view on irelands election a contest with consequences","story":"Britain’s political class is insular. It rarely shows any interest in foreign elections. That general rule may get bent as the United States presidential election gets into gear in the coming weeks. But the evidence of this country’s default inwardness is that there is an election on this side of the Atlantic in less than three weeks with a far more immediate bearing on Britain than the one in America. This one will get only a fraction of the attention that will be expended on the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. But then this one is in Ireland.Why does Ireland’s 8 February election matter to Britain? Partly for the obvious reason that Ireland is one of Britain’s nearest neighbours. Partly because the peoples of these islands are so intermingled. But more than anything it matters because of Brexit.Britain is less than two weeks away from leaving the European Union. The unique situation on the island of Ireland has been at the heart of the battle over Brexit terms since 2016. The Irish dimension has only just stabilised, at least to a degree, with the restoration of power-sharing in Northern Ireland and the Commons passage of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement bill.But there is plenty of unfinished Brexit business in Ireland, north and south. This includes selling the new withdrawal agreement terms in a ided Northern Ireland, ensuring that trade talks with the EU will work for both parts of the island, and making sure that any deal buttresses the peace process. It matters greatly that the next Irish government should be as effective as the outgoing one has been at insisting that Britain lives up to its promises in the Belfast agreement and crafts a Brexit deal that does not threaten it. Neither Theresa May nor Boris Johnson would have done that without the pressure that Dublin rightly brought to bear.For four years, Ireland has been ruled by economically liberal Fine Gael minority governments under Enda Kenny and Leo Varadkar. These have been kept in place by confidence and supply deals with Fianna Fáil, led by Micheál Martin. But Mr Varadkar’s support in the Dáil has ebbed. His aim to delay the election into the summer faltered. Last week he jumped before he was pushed.On Brexit policy, the prime concern for the UK, little ides the two parties, neither of which is likely to achieve an outright majority on 8 February. Whichever of them emerges the stronger under Ireland’s proportional representation system, continuity of Brexit policy is likely in whatever coalition or arrangement emerges. The chief threat to that would be if Mr Martin was compelled by the result and his party into an unlikely coalition with Sinn Féin, which seeks an early border poll. This is an option Mr Martin has repeatedly ruled out, but which some in his party prefer. Either way this is a new era. For the first time since 1973, the UK and Ireland will be on opposite sides of the table on tariffs and trade.While the UK’s 2019 election was inevitably dominated by Brexit, Ireland’s election is unsurprisingly focusing on its own domestic issues. Mr Varadkar promotes his stewardship of the economy and promises tax cuts. But public dissatisfaction on housing and health make it vulnerable. Fianna Fáil promises higher spending but its prospects will be shaped by whether memories of its role in the 2008 financial crisis have faded. Smaller parties, including Sinn Féin, the Greens and Labour, will play important roles. The contests in Iowa and New Hampshire may be more alluring to British politicians and journalists. But the one in Ireland will matter more to the British people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d431d963eea9e54abc357744ec58b5baeb9b7cd9/0_0_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73ab454ffca2dd7d5e147092e96a116f","title":"slip slop what why putting on sunscreen suddenly seems complicated","story":"Despite concerns over reef health, vitamin D deficiencies and multi-layered skincare routines, tried and tested sunscreen advice holds trueAdvice about sunscreen used to be simple: just wear it. Beyond that, all you needed to know was the higher the SPF the better. We went on like that for decades. The only real ide being whether you were for or against coconut scent.But in recent years, new schools of thought have fractured the status-sunscreen-quo. Twenty-first century sunscreen savants are mulling over formula, producer, recipe, country of origin, and impact on the environment.So when standing in the sunscreen aisle trying to balance the good of your skin, humanity and the planet at large, “just wear it” feels like a complicated demand.When looking for a sunscreen, the Cancer Council’s advice is straightforward: pick one that’s broad spectrum (meaning it filters both UVA and UVB rays), water resistant, and has an SPF of 30 or higher. For anyone who didn’t attend a sun-obsessed Australian primary school, SPF stands for sun protection factor. Be careful though. The Australasian College of Dermatologists is quick to add that “SPF should not be used as a guide for how long you can stay in the sun before you get sunburnt”.The chair of the Cancer Council’s skin cancer committee, Heather Walker, says that beyond SPF, broad spectrum, and water resistance, “it doesn’t really matter what type of ingredients or fragrances are in there”. Although she does suggest trying a few different formulas (milky, dry touch, tinted, the list goes on) to see what appeals. “It’s about finding a formula that you like because then you’re more likely to use it.”Also, the Cancer Council wants you to wear a lot. Probably more than you’re using now. The recommended full-body amount for an adult is seven teaspoons. That’s one for each arm and leg, front of body, back of body, and face, neck, and ears.When it comes to guidance on skincare and cosmetics, Australians have a tendency to look abroad. Our grandmothers worshipped French products, while this century we’ve turned to Asia for skin-care trends. But Walker says you’ll struggle to beat an Australian product, as the active ingredients in sunscreens here are regulated in a similar way to medicines.Look for an AUST L number on the bottle. “That tells you it’s to the standards that the Australian regulator says it should be.”While Australia has some of the strictest regulations in the world, many other countries (especially in Europe) also have very high standards. As we’ve become more conscious of the value of sunscreen, we’ve added it to other products like makeup and moisturisers. While that’s great, it’s not a reason to ditch your daily broad spectrum, TGA-approved favourite.This is because, as mentioned, you need to wear a lot of sunscreen. Most of us aren’t applying makeup and moisturiser thickly enough to offer a good level of protection. Also, as Walker stresses, “cosmetics aren’t regulated the same way as the primary sunscreen, so they might not be held to as high a standard”.That’s not to say these enriched cosmetics don’t have a place. They offer great second wave protection especially for incidental sun exposure (like when you’re in the car or popping out to buy lunch). So hedge your bets and use both.While any threat to the planet’s vulnerable reefs is cause for alarm, it’s a bit more complicated than it’s often presented. Professor of marine biology at James Cook University, Terry Hughes, takes aim at the research behind the claim that sunscreen contributes to coral bleaching. He points out that only two studies have looked at the environmental impacts of sunscreens, and they weren’t “representative of real world conditions”.Rather than worry too much about sunscreen, he pushes the focus around coral bleaching to heat stress and warming oceans. “After Hawaii banned sunscreen, hot temperatures returned this year, triggering more coral bleaching,” he tells  Australia.But while the research is thin, it’s fair to say reefs need all the support they can get. So you may as well use a reef-safe sunscreen – one that’s mineral based or free from benzophene-3 and octinoxate – if you’re spending time in the ocean. Just don’t use this as an excuse to skip sun protection.One of the biggest sources of sunscreen confusion is the distinction between mineral and chemical formulas. The major difference between the two is that mineral sunscreens sit on top of your skin, providing a physical barrier to UV – which is why they’re sometimes called physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens contain ingredients that sink into your skin and absorb UV.This is why so many chemical sunscreens weirdly recommend you apply them under your moisturiser and wait 20 minutes before sun exposure. They need time to absorb, and can react badly with other products.While they offer the same end result, there are usage differences. Dermal therapist James Vivian is a fan of mineral sunscreens. He recommends them to his clients because they’re often part of a multi-step skincare routine. “We encourage our clients to never use a chemical sunscreen over the top of serums and moisturisers as these can reduce the ingredients from penetrating into the skin”.Finally, mineral sunscreens also exclude ingredients that could harm reefs, making them a good option if you’re in the ocean.For something that’s pretty obviously good for you, sunscreen has a small but vocal pool of critics. Mostly found on unregulated health blogs, YouTube, and Pinterest, they’re fans of “natural” and “homemade” alternatives. There’s no point getting into their arguments, because they’re disputed by pretty much every doctor and skin cancer specialist. But in reflecting on the trend towards homemade sunscreens, Walker is clear: “We just would not go there. It’s really not advised. Sunscreens are tested so rigorously in Australia because we have such a high UV environment. You can’t be sure what on earth it’s doing in terms of protecting your skin, and it’s probably nothing. That’s definitely a no-no.”Additionally, some have expressed concern over the role sunscreen may play in vitamin D deficiencies. Vitamin D is needed to ensure calcium absorption, which results in healthy muscles and bones. While it’s possible to get vitamin D through food, the sun’s UVB rays are the best source.The Cancer Council explains that during summer most people reach adequate vitamin D levels through regular incidental exposure to the sun. A few minutes outside, a few times a week, should do it. In winter, or when the UV index is low, it’s worth spending a bit of extra time with your arms or legs uncovered in the sun. But again, incidental exposure – like popping out for a coffee or watering your garden – will be enough.Amid all this noise, the core message is the same. A good sunscreen will have an SPF rating of 30 or higher, an AUST Number, and be waterproof. But no matter what you choose, it needs to be applied liberally and often. As Walker reiterates: “With any sunscreen people put it on and think they’re protected to stay outside for hours and hours.

As a vegetarian, I’m in angst about what is being gently turned over for me in the fryer by one of the chefs. Sitting beside me, the company’s CEO Josh Tetrick tries to put my moral dilemma into perspective. “You’re not my target market,” he says. “It’s people who are eating meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.”The product in the fryer is JUST’s prototype chicken nugget, which costs about $50 to make. It is manufactured from what the industry calls cultured, cell-based or cultivated meat (though the outside world knows it more commonly as lab-grown meat). Not to be confused with “meat” that is plant derived, it is produced directly from animal cells with little need to raise and no need to slaughter actual animals. It is a technology with the potential to fundamentally change the world – significantly replacing the way meat is produced now with a kinder and less environmentally damaging alternative.Cultured meat is a “colossal” market opportunity says Bruce Friedrich, co-founder and executive director of the Good Food Institute (GFI), a nonprofit organisation that promotes cultured meat and plant-based meat. Even a tiny bite of the $1.4tn annual global meat market would be a lot.No cultured meat products are on the market yet and nor has it been approved in any country – but they are expected to begin trickling into high-end restaurants over the next couple of years. A plethora of companies are at various stages of scaling up production and several have done public and private tasting of various prototypes. They are working on everything from chicken to beef to fish and have both humans and pets in their sights.The GFI estimates that since San Francisco Bay Area-based Memphis Meats – the first startup – was founded in 2015, a total of 60 enterprises now make up the market with cultured meat as their sole business focus collectively they have raised nearly $140m in disclosed funding. That comes mostly from venture capitalists but also from agriculture multinationals such as Tyson and Cargill.JUST, which isn’t included in the GFI’s figures because it also makes vegan egg and mayonnaise, announced it was pursuing cultured meat in mid-2017, though it does not disclose what proportion of the $220m-plus it has raised in funding it is directing to its cultured meat endeavours. Meanwhile regulators are working on the approvals process and labelling requirements. Tetrick says JUST is ready to release its chicken nuggets in some high-end restaurants in an Asian country as soon as it has the thumbs up from the country’s regulator, with whom it is in dialogue. Chicken is considered easier in part because the vaccine industry has been using avian stem cells to produce vaccines for years: there is existing knowledge to draw on.Establishing this industry isn’t easy, however. While companies work out technicalities, voices raising concerns about the technology and its implications are coalescing. It is also clear there is no agreed position on whether the material itself even counts as meat. “Cultured meat is in a process of becoming,” sums up Neil Stephens, a sociologist at Brunel University, London, who has been studying the area for over a decade and co-founded the group Cultivate to help build discussion of the technology. “It might become a stable category as meat, but it’s not there yet.”To a certain extent, the science of culturing meat is relatively well understood. The process begins when a cell is taken from an animal and grown up in a lab to permanently establish a culture (called a cell line). The cells can come from a range of sources: biopsies of living animals, pieces of fresh meat, cell banks and even the roots of feathers, which JUST has been experimenting with. Cell lines can either be based on primary cells – for example muscle or fat cells – or on stem cells. Stem cells have the advantage that with different nutrients, or genetic modifications, they are able to mature into any cell type. There is also no limit to how long stem-cell lines can live, so it is possible to use them indefinitely to produce a product. Once a good cell line – for example, one that grows fast and is tasty – has been selected, a sample is introduced into a bioreactor, a vat of culture medium where the cells proliferate exponentially and can be harvested. The resulting meat cell mush can be formed into a plethora of unstructured items, from patties to sausages – with or without other ingredients added for texture. Conventional meat has a variety of cell types from which it derives its flavour, including both muscle and fat, and the companies are trying to broadly replicate that.JUST isn’t specifying how the cell source for the particular nugget I am about to try was obtained – it gets its cells in many ways – but I am assured the process didn’t involve any slaughter, which is why I think I am on safe ground eating it. For most people, notes Tetrick, it won’t matter how the cell is obtained. It is also not disclosing whether it was grown from a primary cell or a stem-cell line (which it doesn’t genetically modify). And I don’t know the exact type of chicken cells in the final product.Yet while establishing cell lines is one thing, scaling them up for mass production at a competitive price is another. The problem is that the culture medium – needed for the cells to grow – is expensive and animal cells can take time to proliferate. And there is no guarantee that a small operation will work at large scale.Compounding the challenge is the need to develop good alternatives to foetal bovine serum (FBS). Derived from the blood of cow foetuses, it is often added to culture media where the growth factors it contains work their magic. But its use is a nonstarter for an industry trying to take animals out of the equation and many companies are hard at work producing their own alternatives. “All of the companies have pledged that they will not sell products that involve FBS in the production,” notes Friedrich.A further aspiration of the companies is moving beyond mush. Technologies such as 3D printing and edible scaffolds may enable this and there have been early demos. But producing, say, a fillet is much more difficult than ground meat. There is also the challenge of getting consumers over the “yuck” factor. Stephens notes that the people prepared to try it tend to be educated, male and young – and that it is they who could help normalise it. Tetrick thinks the answer will ultimately come down to making products that are tasty and affordable – and, in the early days at least, educating people about the process and the benefits, which he notes would also extend to safer products because faecal contamination would be eliminated, as would antibiotics (sterile conditions would stop bacteria and viruses taking hold, and if they did, any contaminated batches could be discarded).For a technology with such far-reaching implications for everything from rural livelihoods to human identity, critical public discussion and debate to date have been relatively limited. But that may be changing.The website Clean Meat Hoax was launched last year by an informal group of 16 animal rights scholars and activists. It rails against cultured meat on the grounds that it still suggests that meat is desirable, and that animals are a resource people can draw on. It contrasts with the more pragmatic position other animal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) have taken in favour of the technology on the grounds that animals’ lives will be saved. “What is incredible to me is how uncritically this technology is being celebrated and I don’t think that’s an accident – we don’t want to consider the possibility that we can stop eating animals,” says site founder John Sanbonmatsu, a philosopher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Meanwhile an advertisement in Brussels metro stations designed to undermine cultured meat contrasts a barn of cows surrounded by greenery to a “meat lab” surrounded by transmission towers. It is the work of the European Livestock Voice campaign – set up last year by a number of European farming industry groups to stress the potential social impacts of upending the meat industry.Other voices, meanwhile, don’t reject the technology wholesale but have concerns over certain aspects.Michael Hansen is a senior scientist in the advocacy ision of the nonprofit organisation Consumer Reports, which compares consumer products. He worries about the potential for bioreactor contamination but also wants more transparency from the companies on their science. How, for example, are they dealing with cells that spontaneously mutate? And what are the implications of the fact that immortal cell lines could, with their uncontrolled growth, be defined as cancer cell lines? He would also like to see data on how end products compare compositionally and nutritionally with the conventional versions. “You would think they would put samples out for somebody to test… but all we have are assertions,” he says.The environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth (FoE), meanwhile, is “keeping an open mind” but stresses that the technology must not distract from existing, proven solutions to helping the planet, such as reducing reliance on animal feed produced on cleared ecoregions, cutting down food waste and supporting healthier diets. It also notes that it is “extremely energy intensive” to produce cultured meat and that the sustainability claims made by the companies will also need “proper assessment”. (JUST’s facilities are currently powered by electricity from the grid, but it plans to be more energy efficient in the future).Perhaps more significantly for the companies, there remains the question of whether cultivated meat should be allowed to be called meat at all if it hasn’t been harvested from a whole animal. The United States announced last year that cell-cultured livestock and poultry products would be regulated jointly by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture but further detailed requirements along with labelling rules are awaited.But others don’t want it to be called meat at all.Steered by the so called “barnyard lobby”, which represents the meat, livestock and poultry industries, over 30 US states have considered or are considering so-called “truth in labelling” laws aimed at preventing words such as “meat”, “beef” or “pork” being used to describe cultured meat (the laws often also target plant-based products). So far, laws have been passed in 12 states. Under Louisiana’s new law, which takes effect later this year, “meat” would specifically exclude anything that was a “cell-cultured food product grown in a laboratory from animal cells”. While state laws will be superseded when federal labelling rules for cultured meat come in, it doubtless sends a strong message to regulators as they decide.Yet, notes Friedrich, whose GFI is challenging various pieces of state legislation in court, the outcomes could be “really bizarre” if cultivated meat cannot be called meat. “Some people have meat allergies… It’s a consumer safety issue,” he says.If meat were to removed from the name, it would be a blow to an industry that believes that being recognised as meat is the most likely way to change the world. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that last year cultured meat companies came together to form their own lobby group.Meanwhile, what’s a vegetarian to do where cultured meat is concerned? And what to make of the many company founders, including Tetrick, who would be vegan if they didn’t eat their own products? For the UK Vegetarian Society, there isn’t enough information yet to decide whether cultured meat can be considered vegetarian. “There are still questions to answer,” it says, adding that those questions centre on production, ingredients, provenance and ethics. In contrast, for the UK Vegan Society, it is definitively not a vegan product because “the initial cells are taken from animals”. “We may need a new word for people who eat exclusively cultivated meat,” says Friedrich.Certainly, from what meat is to what it is to be vegetarian or vegan, cultured meat is blowing apart our existing categorisations. Meat cell product, anyone?Wild Earth, a San Francisco Bay Area-based startup, also set out culturing mouse meat for cats but changed course after its market research showed many pet owners were alarmed by the prospect and didn’t understand the concept. “They thought we were killing mice and putting them into cans,” says Ryan Bethencourt, co-founder and CEO. (Jokingly, Bethencourt codenamed the would-be product “Jerry”, inspired by Tom and Jerry cartoons.) It is now working on growing chicken and fish for dogs and cats instead. The vision is for a premium raw product in the first instance, appealing to those who feed conventional raw meat to their animals.Bethencourt wonders whether pet food might be a “gateway” for cultured meat. People have shown greater willingness to be innovative with pet food, he says, citing the popularity of cricket treats for dogs. Pet food isn’t so steeped in taste and tradition. The biggest market driver is expected to be pet owners wanting to avoid contaminants such as euthanasia drugs, which can get into pet food in the animal flesh that goes into the ingredients.But cultured meat is not likely to be approved for pet food ahead of human food – pet food regulators take their cues from human-food regulators. Meanwhile the industry has some advantages. Creating texture or perfecting taste is less important. And people are used to pet food being a blend of different ingredients. Percentages of cultured meat also don’t have to be as high. “Financially it’s going to be more feasible to be a pet food company,” says Falconer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbbae11c9ea2fc879758824f19e3f2450bd9f46e/0_878_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02bd344815b4d93be51b37ddcbbe068b","title":"when nigel slater met nadiya hussain curry cake","story":"Over curry and cake, two of the UK’s best-loved food writers talk about family, anxiety and learning to cope with life in the public eyeIt is almost lunchtime when Nadiya Hussain arrives at my front door. She is bearing gifts. Among them, a tin of pastries she had fried that morning. “They’re my mum’s favourite,” she adds, handing me a tin of flaky, parcels, laminated like a cronut, each layer dusted with icing sugar and freckled with black onion seeds. We debate whether they are savoury or sweet. (The answer is both.) Two are wolfed instantly without the tea and clotted cream she insists they need and the rest are squirrelled away for tomorrow’s breakfast, but only because we are about to tuck into lunch.Even before she reached the final of The Great British Bake Off, Nadiya was known to television viewers by a single name, like Nigella or Jamie. What fans of the programme like myself couldn’t know, as we took this quietly confident contestant to our hearts, was that between takes, she was running off to cry in the loo, shaking with nerves and unsure about how this could ever have happened to her.Nadiya hadn’t even entered Bake Off herself. It was her husband, Abdal, who had sent in the application to be considered against those of 13,000 other hopefuls. Racked with anxiety attacks and a distinct lack of confidence, her hands already full as a mother, the idea of being watched by millions on one of the country’s most popular TV programmes was for her unthinkable. Only weeks previously she had broken down in tears, exhausted, in the doctor’s surgery. He had prescribed antidepressants.“From the moment I got married and became a housewife and had my kids, I had never experienced fear. I had protected myself from it. I never spent a moment away from them. When my husband came home, the kids would be in bed, everything would be like clockwork. I would go and see Mum and Dad in Luton every three weeks. It was a routine. I never did anything spontaneous.”I am intrigued why she had accepted the call. “For the first time I got that flutter of fear. I had to sit in the car for an hour on the phone, with the kids in the back. I had to entertain them while I talked. I felt a rising bubble of fear.”Anyone who has read Finding my Voice, Nadiya’s 2019 memoir, will know of the insecurities that hide behind the beaming smile and her masterful put-downs of internet trolls. Insecurities that remain to this day. We have met a couple of times before at parties and yet she admits, “I suddenly got an attack of nerves coming here.” I quickly point out that I’d had one too, when it dawned on me that not only was I baking a cake for the winner of Bake Off but also cooking rice for someone who has been doing so on a daily basis since she was five. (It turns out we approach the matter identically, swishing the grains through several bowls of water till the liquid is clear, covering with the same 3cm of cold water and adding the same aromatics – cinnamon stick, black peppercorns and cardamom.)Nadiya’s latest cookbook, Time To Eat, is a collection of her trademark, user-friendly recipes. Peppered with ideas for a crustless spinach quiche, pizza paratha and baked bean falafel with a sriracha mayonnaise, it is one of four cookbooks she has penned, along with six children’s books. I choose a curried chicken recipe, a riff on one she was given in Thailand, made with a toasted coconut spice paste.We chat as I stir creamed coconut into the curry sauce and apologise for wimping out at the inclusion of 120g of chillies (I use 90g, a mistake, I should have trusted her). Nadiya asks if something is burning. Of course it is. The bloody rice. Only an hour before, as I stirred the spice paste that was the base for her lunch, the kitchen was filled with the scent of toasting coconut, sweet and reassuring, like that of popcorn at the cinema. Now it smells of burned rice. Luckily, the damage is minimal. We simply have a dark golden crust on the bottom of the pan, like the much-prized crust of the Persian tahdig. We tuck into my rendition of Nadiya’s curry with our hands.As popular as Nadiya’s chop-n-chat cookery shows are, it is her documentaries I find even more rewarding. The first, where she travelled to Bangladesh, newly famous and accompanied by a film crew to catch up with her extended family, had me welling up. It is a programme I hold up as the very best example of travel-cum-cookery show. (She is in the middle of another.) And yet it is the honest, intimate and raw film about her own mental health that really made the headlines. At that point, few had talked quite so publicly about such matters as anxiety, panic attacks, bullying and depression. It launched a small and welcome avalanche of stories from celebrities we had always assumed overflowed with confidence.The conversation inevitably turns to that of her new position as role model. Was it what you wanted, I venture.“It was definitely accidental. I didn’t go into television to end up as anyone’s role model. I’ve got three children and, ultimately, my only job is to be a role model to them. I didn’t mean to do Bake Off, I certainly didn’t get into it to win. And when I won I didn’t do so to become a role model. It just happened.” What actually happened was that Nadiya’s off-the-cuff winning speech sent her words viral.“If you had asked me two or three years ago I’d have told you I just want to look after the family and bake. I didn’t want to talk about myself or about my religion – that’s changed for me. I am a Muslim, a British Bangladeshi woman of colour. And I feel I have a responsibility to the younger generation.” Nadiya lacked a role model growing up, her mother being more traditional. “I just had to help myself.“It scares me because when you are in the public eye you are under constant scrutiny what you wear, if you’ve put on a bit of weight, everything is magnified. It’s lovely to be a role model but I never claim to be a perfect version of myself, that I don’t shout or have bad days or get angry sometimes.“I just have to take this on, because if I don’t do it, who will? There are many people who have had that responsibility and felt it’s too much. And it is too much sometimes. I have people who say I am not representing Muslims properly or Bangladeshis properly. With any group there are unspoken rules, and as a British woman growing up in a Bangladeshi home in Luton I don’t know what those unspoken rules are. They are so blurred.”A week before our lunch I had attended, along with a thousand other fans, a talk given by Nadiya and Emma Freud at the Royal Festival Hall. The conversation went from cake to bullying and back to cake. She admitted she doesn’t eat much cake. She makes it for Adbal and her kids. Knowing that, I still insist on baking for her (a ginger cake we later pack up into boxes for the family). As I slice through the lemon icing into the pear and ginger crumbs beneath, I suddenly feel self-conscious.For someone who puts family and faith first, who writes both successful cookbooks and children’s stories, does cookery demonstrations to anything up to 3,000 people at a time, I would have thought there was little time for anything else. Despite having no help at home, Nadiya seems unfazed by such an idea. She would certainly, I suggest, be a refreshing guest on Question Time, and she positively relishes the idea of a bushtucker trial with Ant and Dec.Bake Off was the most extraordinary idea, a programme where viewers were asked to watch a room full of people making cakes for an hour each week. I doubt it would be commissioned now. Too gentle, too calm, not enough conflict. But if the programme’s viewers hadn’t already fallen in love with her over the eight butter- and sugar-laden episodes, they did so as she gave her tearful and off-the-cuff winning speech, which was humble, charming and yet now thoroughly empowered. “I’m never going to put boundaries on myself again. I’m never going to say I can’t do it. I can and I will,” she said, while Mary Berry wiped tears from her cheek.And with that, Nadiya slips away back to Abdal and the kids, my ginger cake in hand, and I scrape burned rice from the bottom of the pan. OFMThe Hopes and Triumphs of the Amir Sisters by Nadiya Hussain is published on 23 January (HQ, £8.99)From my travels through Thailand this is a recipe that has stayed with me – it’s fragrant, creamy and spicy, warming and delicious. I don’t know whose grandmother started this, but whoever she is, we are thankful, because it is one of the best things ever to pass my lips. The paste is pretty versatile. It is a great base for any curry be adventurous with the protein you choose – fish, lamb or chunks of good hearty vegetables.

Toast the 150g of desiccated coconut until very brown. Put it into a blender with the peppercorns, and blend until the peppercorns are broken down. Add the garlic, ginger, chillies, lemongrass, turmeric, salt and oil. Blend till you have a smooth paste. If it isn’t moving, scrape the sides down and add some more oil until it does.Transfer the paste to a large jar. This makes a large amount, and it will keep in the fridge for 6 months.To make the curry, put the 100g of desiccated coconut into a large pan and toast until dark brown. Take off the heat and stir in the paste, then add the garlic paste, ginger paste and the coconut cream and mix really well.Add the whole chicken to the pan and pour over the water – you need enough to come about three-quarters of the way up the chicken. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and leave the whole thing to cook gently for 1 hour.Take off the heat and use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken, gently, as it will be falling apart. Place it on a large plate or a board. While the chicken is cooling slightly, turn up the heat under the liquid in the pan and boil rapidly for 10-15 minutes.Pull the chicken off the bones, using two forks as it will be hot, and discard the bones. Put the chicken back in the pan and cook slowly for another 30 minutes with the lid off.Meanwhile, cook enough rice for 6 people.Mix the cornflour with 3 tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl, then stir it into the sauce for the last 5 minutes of cooking, together with the mangetout and baby corn.Put the rice on a platter and pour all the chicken on top. Sprinkle with chopped coriander and serve with wedges of lime.Leftovers can be frozen in a tub or freezer bag.From Time to Eat by Nadiya Hussain (Michael Joseph, £20)My favourite cake, baked for Nadiya and Abdal.Serves 9For the pearspears 500gbutter 30g agave or golden syrup 1 tbspFor the cakeself-raising flour 250gground ginger 2 level tspmixed spice ½ tspground cinnamon ½ tspbicarbonate of soda 1 tspsalt a pinchagave or golden syrup 200mlbutter 125gdark muscovado 125geggs 2 largemilk 240mlFor the icingicing sugar 250glemon juice 3 tbsp preserved ginger in syrup 3 knobscrystilised roses 9poppy seeds 1 tbspYou will need a square cake tin measuring approximately 22cmPeel, halve and core the pears, then cut them into 2cm dice. Warm the butter in a shallow, non-stick pan, then add the pears and leave to cook for 10 minutes over a low to moderate heat, until they are pale gold and translucent. Towards the end of their cooking time, add the spoonful of agave or golden syrup. Remove from the heat and set aside.Line the base and sides of the cake tin with baking parchment.Set the oven at 180Cgas mark 4.Sift the flour with the ground ginger, mixed spice, cinnamon, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Pour the syrup into a small saucepan, add the butter and the muscovado and warm over a moderate heat until the butter has melted. When the mixture has simmered for a minute remove from the heat.Break the eggs into a bowl, add the milk and beat lightly to combine. Pour the butter and syrup mixture into the flour and spices and stir gently until no flour is visible. Mix in the milk and eggs. Fold in the cooked pears and scrape the mixture into the lined cake tin. The pears should sink to the bottom. Slide the cake into the oven and bake for about 35-40 minutes, until it is lightly puffed and spongy to the touch. Leave to cool in the tin.To make the icing, put the icing sugar into a bowl, then beat in the lemon juice, either with a fork or using a small hand whisk. Take it steady, only using enough to make an icing thick enough that it takes a while to fall from the spoon.Remove the cake from its tin and peel back the parchment. Trickle the icing over the cake, letting a little run down the sides. When the icing is almost set, add slices of crystallised ginger and the sugared roses and scatter lightly with poppy seeds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75ff81fa689dd1bea0301e6dab4b86ed6112c090/322_452_2605_1563/master/2605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fa3e52ef70f62c090b17444c193c1d1","title":"arsenal chelsea womens super league match report","story":"“Wow, wow, wow.” Their manager could not believe it. Emma Hayes turned, back to the pitch, and uttered her exclamations. A clearance from a free-kick had bounced in front of Chelsea’s Sophie Ingle and the midfielder had lashed a left‑foot half-volley into the far corner past Arsenal’s Manuela Zinsberger to give the Blues a 3-0 lead inside 20 minutes.The Arsenal manager, Joe Montemurro, labelled it “the biggest setback I’ve had in my two and a bit years here”.In front of a sellout 4,000 fans the title holders were left shell-shocked. The title race was blown open. Now only goal difference separates Arsenal and Manchester City, who leapfrogged the London club after a 2-0 win at Birmingham, while Chelsea are a point behind, with a game in hand.Hayes said: “I looked at my watch on 22 minutes, when we were three up, and I thought: ‘This is a strange situation to be in.’ We’re hungry, you can see it, this is a team that performs in the biggest games.”The visiting team exploded out of the blocks, pressing hard, swamping the midfield, a pack of wolves circling every player each time they conceded possession. Every drive forward looked like it would result in a goal, the glaring low sun in the eyes of the Gunners defence and Zinsberger helping them along.This was a reversal of Arsenal’s 5-0 drubbing of their bitter rivals at Kingsmeadow in October 2018 that signalled the trophy was on the move. If results between the two sides since have favoured Chelsea, none until now have come close to alleviating the bruises that defeat inflicted on their home turf.Hayes’s rebuilding of her side has perhaps been quicker than expected. After their League and FA Cup double‑winning campaign in 2017-18 and the departure of players such as Katie Chapman, Eni Aluko, Gemma Davison, Claire Rafferty and Gilly Flaherty, many believed it would take time for her to slot players in to replace such key figures. But with last season a blip, Hayes’s motherhood very much impacting the early stages of their campaign, they have since picked up where they left off.It took only 10 minutes for the Blues to make the breakthrough with Guro Reiten the architect, the Norwegian flicking into the path of Beth England who cut into the box from wide on the right and curled a shot inside the far post. For a team that had conceded first in their previous four league fixtures, and seven times in 11 games, there was relief as much as anything in the celebrations.The talk before this match had been dominated by the star strikers Sam Kerr and Vivianne Miedema. The former may have edged the encounter, her close-range header from a deep Reiten cross to double the lead, her first goal in Chelsea blue. Miedema, though, could be somewhat forgiven for her struggles with not even the creative muscle of Kim Little and Jordon Nobbs enough to break through the tight lines of Chelsea’s defence, space vanishing around them at every turn as blue shirts nipped at their feet, urged on by Hayes and her coaches.“We decided to not play with a lot of width,” said Montemurro. “We decided to play with a lot of inside to outside movement. It didn’t work.“It’s always hard sitting back and seeing a team so powerful putting us under a lot of pressure and creating chances. The disappointing thing is we couldn’t even get the ball down and play. I take responsibility for the set-up.”With Arsenal pressing harder for a reply they were understaffed at the back and Jonna Andersson’s cross from the left just had to be glanced in by Reiten for Chelsea’s fourth, and a goal for the 25-year-old to add to her two assists. The substitutes Lisa Evans and Beth Mead linked up for the home team’s consolation but it did little to paper over the cracks of a side out of ideas.“This is an amazing team, these are amazing players and you’re allowed a slip-up every once in a while,” Montemurro said. “But if you look historically at this team it is always one that comes back and will be there.”Goals from the England duo Ellen White and Kiera Walsh either side of the break ensured Manchester City went top of the Women’s Super League with a 2-0 defeat of Birmingham.It took White just 34 seconds to pounce, firing her first-time strike after a sharp cross from Jill Scott. Scott provided the assist for the second too, her pull-back to Walsh ricocheting in off the post to kill any hopes of a Birmingham fightback.Two goals from Katie Zelem helped Manchester United see off Tottenham 3-0 at a foggy Leigh Sports Village. A penalty in the second half from the United captain gave them the lead before Jess Sigsworth capitalised from a corner. Zelem sealed the points late on but the substitute Ella Toone was sent off in added time to dampen the win which takes them above Everton into fourth on goal difference.A hat-trick from the Everton youngster Chloe Kelly ensured they overtook Reading with a 3-1 win. Fara Williams cancelled out the 22-year-old’s opener but she helped her side regain the lead with a goal direct from a corner before converting a cross for her third.New recruit Rachel Furness scored the only goal as Liverpool earned their first win of the season to move off the bottom and above their opponents Bristol City on goal difference.

The goalkeeper saved his side on at least three occasions, most notably in the 66th minute when he kept out a Jamie Vardy penalty that would have put the visitors 2-1 in front.“Nick didn’t have a ridiculous amount to do but when he was called on he made some big saves,” Sean Dyche said. “We’d lost our previous four games and it’s not easy when you go a goal down, but we showed our character and it’s great to get back to winning ways.”Rodgers was annoyed about the winning goal – “their desire to score was greater than our desire to stop it” – but conceded Pope had been the key performer. “We didn’t take our chances, and a lot of that was down to the goalkeeper,” the Leicester manager said. “He’s a big unit, he blocks a lot of the goal off and he made some amazing saves.”Leicester could have taken the lead in the opening minute but for Burnley-born Harvey Barnes shooting rather tamely at Pope with a clear sight of goal. As soon as James Tarkowski sliced a clearance Leicester sent men streaming forward, and it was apparent from that early stage that if they were allowed to get anywhere near the Burnley penalty area James Maddison’s passing and Vardy’s movement would cause problems.After surviving a couple more scares from those two players Burnley were doing a good job of keeping Leicester safely pinned back in their own half until they were caught unprepared just before half-time. Dennis Praet dispossessed the advancing Jack Cork on the halfway line, bringing down the Burnley man as he did so, but while Cork and several of his teammates expected a free-kick the referee Anthony Taylor waved play on and allowed Barnes to surge towards goal. With what remained of the Burnley defence retreating it was a relatively straightforward task for the winger to take the ball round Ben Mee and shoot past Pope.When the second half commenced it produced enough goalmouth action in the first few minutes to banish memories of a rather featureless first half. Praet seemed certain to score when Maddison and Barnes found him a way into the penalty area, only for Pope to e to his right to get a good hand to a well-struck shot. Then Burnley came down the field for Chris Wood to head over the bar from Charlie Taylor’s cross, before Maddison almost scored at the other end with a shot from just outside the area.With Ashley Barnes out injured, Wood’s aerial ability appeared to be Burnley’s best hope of pulling a goal back, though when the equaliser arrived just before the hour it was Mee who met Dwight McNeil’s corner with a header. Kasper Schmeichel got a hand to the ball but could do no more to keep it out, allowing Wood to pounce for a close range tap-in.No sooner had Burnley regained parity, however, than they threatened to throw it away again when Mee was adjudged to have fouled Barnes in the area. The defender was at least guilty of a messy challenge that got nowhere close to the ball, and VAR backed the referee’s decision to award a spot-kick, yet Pope came to his side’s rescue again by ing to his left to reach the penalty with Ricardo Pereira shooting narrowly wide from the rebound. If it was unlike Vardy to fail from 12 yards, it was even stranger to see him pass up a perfect invitation from Kelechi Iheanacho a few minutes later, running behind the Burnley defence to reach a superbly weighted pass but managing to find Pope’s chest instead of the usual target.The goalkeeper deserved credit for standing tall and his third notable save was followed almost immediately by Ashley Westwood’s winner, the midfielder latching on to an ineffective clearance from Jonny Evans to score for the first time at Turf Moor. For showing more fight and purpose than their opponents in the second half it was probably what Burnley deserved, though without Pope’s penalty save it might have been very different."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80372203c8acb579f98bed750ea3bfbfd5565d32/0_207_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4027a43d11b1e4b269cbb87ad0efbe1","title":"european roundup football milan udinese mallorca valencia inter juventus bayern hertha","story":"Ante Rebic broke his Milan duck with two second-half goals, including a stoppage-time winner as they beat Udinese in a five-goal thriller.Zlatan Ibrahimovic started for the first time since returning to the club for a six-month loan, but Milan made a terrible start. With six minutes played, goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma rushed out of his area and collided with Udinese’s Kevin Lasagna, leaving Jens Stryger Larsen to slot into an empty net.Rebic came on at half-time and levelled from close range within three minutes, his first goal since joining on loan from Eintracht Frankfurt at the start of the season. Donnarumma then made amends for his mistake with saves from Rolando Mandragora and Stefano Okaka before Milan took the lead.Theo Hernandez rifled the hosts in front in style, steering a volley into the bottom corner from outside the area after a corner was cleared. Ibrahimovic fired over from Rafael Leão’s pass, but Lasagna silenced the San Siro by heading Udinese level in the 85th minute.Milan looked like they would have to settle for a point but Rebic had the final word, collected a loose ball on the edge of the area and threading his shot through a pack of defenders to seal a dramatic victory.In La Liga, Valencia’s Champions League hopes were hit by a shock defeat at Real Mallorca, who boosted their survival bid with a 4-1 win.Amid stormy conditions in Palma, Albert Celades’ side quickly fell two goals behind, Antonio Raillo and Ante Budimir striking for the hosts. Budimir added his second before half-time, finishing a fine team move from a tight angle.Valencia’s hopes of a fightback were extinguished when Daniel Parejo was sent off for picking up a second yellow card.

Liverpool could have made it easier for themselves, and but for a couple of poor final passes to Mane and a silly Salah miss it would surely have been a straightforward home win. But United eventually fought their way into the game, and after Mata and Greenwood were introduced they were the more dangerous team. Martial had their one real chance, and fluffed it real bad.Sky try very hard to force Henderson andor Salah to admit that they look title-bound, but it’s not happening. Here’s Henderson:We’re not really thinking about the end. Why should we change now? Why think about the end of the season? There’s still a lot of games left. For us as players it’s the next game, the next challenge, and the Premier League’s tough. United played well at times today, but overall I think we deserved the three points. 1-0’s a dangerous scoreline. I feel as though we should have killed the game off earlier, with the chances that we had, but we kept going, defended well and managed to get a second in the end. This is special. We’re enjoying our football. But you’ve got to stay hungry, you’ve got to keep learning, keep wanting more. We’re going to keep going until the end of the season.90+4 mins: “We’re going to win the league!” sing the home fans as the final seconds tick away. And it’s all over!And from United’s corner, Liverpool score! Alisson gets the assist, booting upfield to release Salah, who runs into the area and slides past De Gea!90+2 mins: United win another corner. De Gea is denied permission to go up for it.90+2 mins: Every cross seems to dip onto Van Dijk’s forehead. He heads coear again, the ball is kicked high into United’s half, and De Gea runs from his goal to beat Salah to it.90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, or thereabouts. United have the ball back, and continue to press.90 mins: Liverpool break. Henderson runs through but can’t quite outpace Dalot and thus has to rush and indeed fluff his cross.89 mins: United take a short corner to Mata. Lallana pokes the ball away from the Spaniard, who manages to convert the situation into a free kick, which leads to another corner. Pressure.88 mins: The home side counter. Alexander-Arnold sets Salah sprinting against Wan-Bissaka, who keeps up well enough. Salah eventually chips a decent cross to the far post, where nobody is there to head in.87 mins: Shaw is suffering from a spot of cramp, forcing United to take him rather than Wan-Bissaka off as Diogo Dalot comes on.86 mins: Liverpool’s post-substitional tactical rejig has seen them switch to a 4-5-1, with Salah on his own up front.84 mins: There have been spells in this match where United have been on the verge of being submerged. Had Salah converted that chance early in this half, that might indeed have happened. Instead here they are, still a single goal down and with six minutes to take advantage of an increasingly jittery Anfield.82 mins: Liverpool use up their last two substitutions, bringing on Fabinho and Divock Origi, and taking off Firmino and Mane.81 mins: United win a corner, and it’s curled towards the near post where four of their players compete with one defender. It looked to me like Maguire headed it clear.80 mins: United keep the ball around Liverpool’s area for a while, until Mata plays a one-two with Wan-Bissaka and scoops in a lovely-looking but inaccurate cross that bounces through to Alisson.78 mins: Martial’s excellent cross is just too high for Greenwood. United, though, are starting to sniff an equaliser.77 mins: Alexander-Arnold crosses towards the onrushing Mane, who backheels towards Firmino, but there’s a little bit too power on his touch and by the time the Brazilian has it under control and is facing the goal, there are too many defenders there for him to get a shot on target.74 mins: United make a double substitution, bringing Juan Mata and Mason Greenwood on and taking Williams and Pereira off.72 mins: Salah spins past Shaw, who has both hands round the Egyptians waist as he attempts to recover. Free kick, and a booking.70 mins: For the last 10 minutes or so we have had a pretty even game, with both sides threatening.67 mins: Now a better shot from distance, this time from Fred. This time Alisson shovels it behind for a corner.67 mins: Martial hits a low 30-yarder straight at Alisson. 66 mins: Liverpool take off Oxlade-Chamberlain, who looks extremely grumpy about either this decision or his own performance, and bring on Lallana.63 mins: Another chance for Liverpool. They break from the edge of their area, Wijnaldum does excellently to beat Maguire in the centre circle and he releases Mane, but Lindelof does well to hold up his run and force him onto his left foot, and his eventual shot is feeble and off target.61 mins: How Liverpool’s goal survived the last five minutes I don’t know. Those two chances, for Fred and Martial, have changed the flow of the game a bit, building United’s confidence and weakening Liverpool’s.59 mins: Impossible miss! Martial plays a one-two with Pereira, chests the ball down, and lashes the ball goalwards from 12 yards or so, but it flies over the bar!57 mins: A chance for an equaliser! Fred intercepts Alexander-Arnold’s poor long throw on the halfway line and runs without any kind of challenge into Liverpool’s penalty area, where he shoots wide of the near post. “As frustrating as the whole situation was around the first disallowed goal, I take some small crumb of satisfaction from the fact that De Gea picked up an insanely unnecessary yellow card,” writes Matt Dony. “His protests had no effect on the final outcome. He screamed in a man’s face, then the decision went his way anyway. Also, my father played in goal back in the ‘good old days’. He fondly remembers times when, in the face of a couple of 14 stone forwards charging at him, he had no choice but to throw the ball over the crossbar and concede a corner. Keepers today don’t know they’re born.”56 mins: How United’s goal survived the last 10 minutes I don’t know.55 mins: Firmino dances inside the penalty area, humiliating a couple of defenders before shooting into Wan-Bissaka’s bum.52 mins: Alexander-Arnold’s cross hits Shaw’s hand, but no dice from the officials (it was, to be fair, thundered into him from no distance). Oxlade-Chamberlain’s low shot is easily saved by De Gea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efe70caa31f30482c45dc8753a30127f80edf2b8/0_1077_7696_4619/master/7696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc96eef74e6632f47e7ed412a2468db","title":"big narstie im the epitome of making it from the ground up","story":"As the rapper from Brixton gets ready for his third television series, he talks about getting fit, getting high and getting what he wantsBig Narstie, the grime artist and TV personality, pats his 84kg puppy. “He’s trained to find money and he’s trained to find weed,” he explains. We are sitting on a sofa in a nondescript flat in Essex – the “man-cave,” Narstie calls it. It’s a short walk away from the large, four-bedroom house in which he lives with his partner and two children. The puppy is wearing a rose-gold collar. Narstie is wearing a gigantic diamond pendant that involves an elaborate, custom-made, jewelled portrait of the puppy. “Daddy can’t shine if his boy don’t shine,” he says.A moment ago, I had asked him, I think, about his Bafta-nominated TV programme, The Big Narstie Show, which returns for its third series soon. But this is how it is to be in Narstie’s presence. You don’t interview him. You spend time in his vicinity and listen gratefully as the soundbites spill out of his mouth, one after the other.Here’s Narstie on his songwriting process: “All my best songs were written on the toilet. I take a cold drink in there. It’s where I flow.”Here he is on his exercise regime: “I’ve been learning some acrobatical stuff for my fat size, cuz.”And here he is on his rise to fame: “I came from fuck all. I’m the epitome of making it from the ground up.”Narstie is a peculiar kind of celebrity. Born Tyrone Lindo to Jamaican parents, he grew up in Brixton and shot to notoriety as a rapper, first as part of the grime crew N-Double-A, and later as a solo artist. His early EPs were met with acclaim. When the Bassline Drops, his 2015 collaboration with Craig David, has been streamed 50m times on Spotify and Apple Music. His first full-length album, BDL Bipolar, which was released in 2018, features a rap verse by Ed Sheeran, who is godfather to Narstie’s daughter. Music is central to his personality, he says. He writes whenever and wherever he can.But it his personality – his habit for unfiltered, free-wheeling, wildly meandering conversation – that has catapulted him to stardom. In 2017, Narstie made a guest appearance on Gogglebox, alongside Sheeran, and quickly became a viral sensation. (He may or may not have been high.) The same thing happened when he popped up on the The Great British Bake Off, last year, and when he had a stint presenting the weather on Good Morning Britain, in 2018. (“Is Big Narstie the best weather presenter ever?” the Radio Times asked. “Yes.”) For a time, audiences couldn’t escape his particular kind of upbeat high jinks, particularly on social media, across which he is terrifically active. Everything seemed entirely natural. Unscripted. Exciting. He has the rare and charming knack of making everything and everyone around him come alive.In 2016, commissioning editors at Channel 4 spotted his star potential on a news segment in which he candidly lamented the lack of black UK artist nominees at that year’s Brit Awards, and suggested he might like to make his own chatshow. Narstie said he wanted to concentrate on music. But the producers chased for weeks and weeks and, in the end, Narstie relented – with stipulations. “They said: ‘We’re not doing it unless we do it our way,’” Jasmine Dotiwala, a Channel 4 broadcaster, recalls. Narstie’s team demanded full editorial control, complete rights ownership and a share of production revenue. “It is literally unheard of to negotiate with Channel 4 like this,” Dotiwala continues. “You can’t help but respect the hustle.”The resulting series, The Big Narstie Show, is a chat-show in which Narstie and comedian Mo Gilligan use an unfiltered and comedically anarchic execution to turn the traditional format on its head. Narstie has always been keen to involve a erse mash-up of guests, a mixture he is said to refer to as “patty and caviar”. The energy of the show is puerile and raucous, but it contains tender moments, too. On one episode, UK rapper Giggs told Hollywood actor David Schwimmer that he was a huge fan of Friends, and that the show helped him through his time in prison.His mother still lives in Brixton and remains a powerful influence in his life. Growing up, she supported her four children as an NHS nurse, but things were hard. “She worked with schizophrenic people,” Narstie says. “I used to eat breakfast at the hospital with a guy who thought he was Rambo, and then I’d jump on the No 322 bus to school.” He dissolves into giggles at the absurdity of the memory. “That was sick!”I ask him if he’s always been able to see the funny side of the darkness of life. “Nah, I grew up quick due to the circumstances.” Is that where his ambition comes from? “It’s about never going back to the shit-hole that is poverty. To living off £60 a month. Where existence is just survival. Now I’m a free man, I never want to go back.”Narstie doesn’t think he was meant to be famous, and you couldn’t say he’s chased celebrity. His immediate circle is a tight group of old friends. He does not employ a publicist. “The key to my success is people power,” he says. “It’s nothing to do with the industry. I know that if 200,000 of my fans phone the establishment and say, ‘Play that fat cunt,’ they have to!”Why do his shows strike such a chord? “Because it’s real-G shit,” he says. “There’s two types of England, innit! There’s the England they want to show to the rest of the world, and there’s the real England, the England that people actually live in.”Talk erts to… exercise. Narstie trains four times a week, he says – mostly martial arts. He hasn’t had a drop of alcohol since he started training two years ago.“Truth be told, I’m a hippie more than a drinker,” he says. “I’m from the Rastafari faith. I believe that weed was found on King Solomon’s grave. Weed is the tree of knowledge. It’s a medicine that heals people. It helps me with my music and thoughts.”The alcohol abstinence seems part of a deeper inner journey. “Since I’ve been training, I got the aggression out my system. Ultimately, love will bring your soul further than fear or aggressive power.” He adds: “People say, ‘You look like you’re enjoying life so much.’ But, like, how do they know? Because I lived on the wild side for so long I don’t take things for granted. I’ve got bare friends in prison, so I’m grateful to be walking around, being free, having the choice to eat Cheetos and my nice Calypso drink.” He points to a plastic bag full of snacks and drinks. “I appreciate everything, because I still remember what it means to have nothing.”Later that evening, Narstie is due to appear on The Rob Rinder Verdict – “Rinderman is a rassclaat G!” – so we leave the man-cave and drive to the studio. Narstie is wearing Gucci sliders with socks and a Ralph Lauren polo shirt. As we drive he talks about the importance of maximising his opportunities while he has them. “I sell merchandise on my website,” he explains. “And I just bought a gym, which will have a CBD centre with a range of hemp and CBD products. And I’m about to open a music bar and a club in Tenerife, which will be called Base, like my grime crew, Base Defence League. I can hustle anything. I’m also investing in property. I want to be the fat, black Robbie Fowler” – he’s referring to the ex-Liverpool footballer who became one of Britain’s biggest private landlords after retiring from the game – “and I got series three of The Big Narstie Show coming up, and we’re filming other projects. Wherever man can fit in, I’m trying. Some might work. Some might not. I just don’t want to be old and upset that I didn’t try stuff. If it works, give God thanks. If it doesn’t, so be it, on to the other one.”Narstie is keen to use his position to help others. “The little what I’ve got, man is trying to help. I like to give opportunities,” he says. He gives to charity. He is an ambassador for the Baked Bean Company, a south London school for people with learning disabilities, where he also regularly performs. Flamboyantly, he recently invested in a helicopter, which seems over-the-top, but everything counts. The helicopter is emblazoned with the Base Defence League logo. “I want to make BDL air cadets,” Narstie says. He is grinning. “Teach young kids from the ends to fly!”Despite his public persona as a man laughing in the face of life, Narstie has talked openly in the press and at universities across the country about his struggles with mental health and he’s worked with the mental health charity Mind.He raps about mental health on his album, which is a curious subject for a grime artist to broach. (On the track Help, from BDL Bipolar, he rapped: “Is it wrong to cry?  Is it wrong to feel to die?”) It is important to him that awareness spreads. “In the Afro-Caribbean community, talk of mental health is shunned,” he says. “If someone in the family had mental health issues, people would think there’s something wrong with the whole family. I always knew I ticked a few of the boxes of symptoms people talked about. Mood swings. Isolation. Being hyper. Being low. Before, I thought I was just being a rassclaat G. But then I realised there was a term for it.”Despite his self-confessed introspection, Narstie is also a shining example of positive body image. “Man is sexual chocolate,” he says of himself, in the car, one of many pearls of self-love. “In the words of my mate Andy: you can only piss with the cock you’ve got. You’re the biggest advertisement of yourself. I’ve always embraced what I am.”When we arrive at the studio, a bunch of people involved with the Rinder show come out to meet him, but Narstie stays outside to smoke. He prefers not to enter a building until the very last minute, until he really, really has to go in for hair and makeup, so he can smoke for longer. Everyone acquiesces. The show’s other celebrity guests are already inside – the comedian Katherine Ryan and Made in Chelsea’s Jamie Laing. But Narstie prefers it in the car park. “I need to be high for this shit,” he says. “That’s how you get the best of me on the show.”The producer tells Narstie that the politician Anna Soubry will be a last-minute guest. “I don’t know none of these fuckers,” he says. “I just know they all get paid to talk shit.”Narstie has an uneasy relationship with the television world, he says, despite it catapulting him to fame. “Do you think that five years ago it would have been acceptable for me to be smoking weed in a place like this?” he says. “I’m the only black person who’s high on national TV. I have clocked on to the simple fact that I am now relevant enough for them to overlook me smoking weed. I am me. I refuse to be anyone else. Give God thanks. Bit of hard work, a lot of luck, I’ve landed to get to a decent stature. I’m not all the way there. I’m not the captain of the ship, but I’m on the boat, you get me?”Narstie goes inside and plays a game on his phone while he waits. As the show starts, he takes a seat off set and falls asleep. Five minutes later, someone gently nudges him awake and he walks on stage. Narstie promptly delivers everything the producers had invited him on to the show to deliver. Zest. Charm. Chaos. Mischief. Humour. His particular brand of streetwise insight flows.“Giraffe neck man,” he says, halfway through the show, when a photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg is shown. He does not completely recognise him. “That man looks like he has zero vibes.” Later, when the show is on a break from airing, he shouts, “Snaaacks!” and someone brings him a bowl of crisps. He dissolves into giggles every now and then, and when he does, the other guests do, too. He makes the show come alive. He’s TV gold. A natural. “I treat shows like sex,” he says, midway through the actual show. “It cannot be forced.”Series 3 of The Big Narstie Show starts on Channel 4 on Friday 7 February at 11pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/703cce60aefab37732f37c830d4342d1b0c45fc8/0_746_7351_4411/master/7351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17bf5887cd067196b214a618c495fa3","title":"how to maintain healthy cholesterol levels","story":"Regular testing will spot if you have high cholesterol, but it’s best to make early changes to your lifestyle to minimise the risk of a heart attack or strokeThe first challenge is pursuading people to get their cholesterol tested. The second is making sure they get it done by a healthcare professional, whether that is with a GP or a practice nurse, or at an NHS Health Check. Some pharmacies and supermarkets are starting to offer tests, and there are local initiatives, too.Symptoms of high cholesterol show only when you are starting to get heart disease as a result: you build up a lot of fatty plaque in your arteries, start to experience shortness of breath, chest pains or angina. By that point, the condition is irreversible – and the earlier in life you have a heart attack or stroke, the worse your long-term outcomes are. Prevention is absolutely better than cure. Most people can start with lifestyle factors. As a nation, we know we are not as active as we should be, that we are increasingly overweight and that our intake of saturated fats is too high – that leads to our cholesterol levels being too high. For most people, the first step would be to reduce their saturated fats intake, and to eat more soy foods, nuts, oats or barley. Eating more fibre and vegetables can help manage cholesterol levels, too. And the more exercise, the better the government says two and a half hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week is the minimum. Taking 10,000 steps a day is good for you but unless that gets you out of breath and your heart rate up, you need to do more. If, after three months of improved diet and increased exercise, someone’s cholesterol levels haven’t shifted much, there may be genetic issues at play. That is why it is just as important to understand your family medical history as it is your own numbers. Some people have normal cholesterol and blood pressure, but have a family history of heart disease and heart attacks or strokes, so they are still prescribed medication, most often statins, which are taken once daily. Everyone should see their GP every year to have their cholesterol and blood pressure checked. A lot can change in 12 months.Christopher Allen, the head of healthcare at Heart UK, was talking to Elle Hunt"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e279824ef60356d1d7dd8fbd9bccef7f0b3ec31/0_1595_3744_2245/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84d72825b58c0c9e93a620632ca84979","title":"i fancy boys and girls but dont know what that makes me mariella frostrup","story":"Our once-binary world is loosening its shackles, says Mariella Frostrup. Be inquisitive but don’t feel pressured to define yourself yetThe dilemma I’m a 16-year-old girl and in need of advice concerning sexuality. I’ve only been questioning it since I was 15, and I frantically search the internet for answers all the time, even though I know it’s not that simple (especially for someone as young as me who has had little experience with relationships). For a while I’ve settled on the term “bisexual”, because I know I’m not straight, but even that doesn’t feel right. I’m physically attracted to boys, but I’ve only had one real crush and that was four years ago. I’m definitely physically attracted to girls, too, although some days I’m not into it as much, and other days I’ll be all for it. This might lead you to think that bisexual is a good label for me to stick with, but I’ve never had a proper crush on a girl, and I don’t know if I could be romantically attracted. I know it sounds pretty silly and that I have time to figure out who I am and what I like, but I’m anxious all the time over it.Mariella replies Thanks for writing. I’m sorry, but not surprised, to hear that you’re feeling confused. As our once-binary world loosens its shackles on our sexuality it sometimes seems to be piling up almost as much pressure as it relieves. With so many choices and tribes to consider, it must be positively baffling to be a teenager awakening to the myriad paths before you. I’m not suggesting we revert to the landscape of my teenage years when, as a girl, even admitting to sexual desire marked you down as a bad ’un, but with so many options, how are you to make your selection? And how much do you want to get bogged down in the “research”?The easiest way to dial down your stress levels would be to remove the pressure you feel to come to a concrete conclusion. Internet trawling for an answer won’t help. It’s one of a number of dilemmas that no search engine can solve and the tsunami of propaganda that flows forth is more likely to exacerbate your quandary. Do you really want adverts to start popping up for sex aids and self-help groups? I’m increasingly wary of seeking any information online that offers marketing potential to interested parties.There’s a whole heap of affiliations more focused on their own agenda than your journey of self-discovery and the genuinely confused are the perfect prey. There are also genuine organisations that exist solely with the intention of providing advice and a like-minded group to communicate with. But they’re just getting harder to locate. If you want someone to simply talk through your concerns I suggest Childline (childline.org.uk), a confidential advice service that covers all subjects.My feeling is that you’re actually in an ideal situation, with your possibilities open and a delightful period of experimentation ahead – if you can manage to put your worries about sexual definition aside. You are the epitome of the thoroughly modern young woman aware of your untapped sexual desires and inquisitive about where they might lead you. In today’s inclusive world to have identified and graded your desires to the extent that you could define them by your mid-teens would be premature. You’ve only just reached the age at which sex is legal and there’s a reason for that beyond protecting you from potential abusers – it’s about protecting you from yourself.Anyone who says they are sure about anything in their teens runs the risk of having to eat humble pie later on. The ways we change through the decades are myriad and so often the roads we take can turn out to be ersions or dead ends. You are allowing one of the big adventures, and indeed pleasures, of growing into adulthood to become a burden and it’s either because others are putting pressure on you, or you are putting pressure on yourself. Neither are conducive to your happiness.Sexuality, far from being fixed, exists on a scale, so settling on any term, even one as loose as bisexual, seems unnecessary and unhelpful. Society has changed dramatically since I was your age in its encouragement and acceptance of the shades of grey involved in who we sexually partner with. Once upon a time teenagers had to fix in their minds their intended career, their chosen sexuality (though anything other than heterosexual came with enormous consequences) and, by the age of 20, were supposedly on the path to settling down.These days there are no such certainties and while that can increase your sense of confusion it also means life is truly what you make of it. There is no point at which you can’t throw everything up in the air and see where it lands, or take a ersion, go full speed ahead or reverse slowly. The point is that you shouldn’t have to decide, and if you do you can change and change again. Rather than fretting about who you might fancy and fall in love with, you’re better employing your energy investigating the great, wide, wonderful world out there for all it has to offer, romantically, physically and intellectually.Do so on your own terms and demand respect for your choices along the way, because it’s on that journey you’ll find out who you are going to become."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a21927abe8a813470a86d6dd98aded80e2690cc1/0_471_7000_4201/master/7000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a44874d88ae9377d9a082d464e63e1b0","title":"peak happiness peak misery 47 psychology wellbeing","story":"So,” I say to my wife, “I’ve been asked to write about happiness peaking when we hit 47.2 years of age.” She stares at me like she’s waiting for a punchline, then shakes her head. “Because I’m about to hit 47.2,” I say, in case she had forgotten that we recently celebrated my 47th birthday. “A team of economists have worked it out.”There is an uncomfortable pause. My wife shakes her head again and says gently: “No, 47.2 is when you hit peak misery. It’s been all over the papers. Have you not been reading them? I was going to send you the links but I didn’t want you to have some sort of meltdown.”This is devastating information. I feel a little like PG Wodehouse’s Freddie Widgeon, who “experienced the sort of abysmal soul-sadness which afflicts one of Tolstoy’s Russian peasants when, after putting in a heavy day’s work strangling his father, beating his wife and dropping the baby into the city’s reservoir, he turns to the cupboards, only to find the vodka bottle empty”.Far from being happy, I am wallowing in the slough of despond. With hindsight, the signs that I am gripped by a midlife crisis were all too obvious. The incessant running, to the point of exhaustion the appearance in the bathroom of a certain type of “shampoo” that should miraculously turn my hair a lustrous brown the urgent need to repeatedly punch myself in the face when I hear politicians like Barry Gardiner or Iain Duncan Smith on the Today programme the decision to read Jordan B Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life twice in the same month.My fate is sealed – it’s hard to argue otherwise. Not in the face of the voluminous research carried out by the eminent economist Professor David Blanchflower, who studied data from 132 countries as he gauged the relationship between wellbeing and age.Blanchflower is the go-to expert on happiness. By my calculation, since the millennium he has written at least 20 papers on the subject. He and Professor Andrew Oswald “Money, sex and happiness: an empirical study”, which found that found that sexual activity appears to have greater effects on the happiness of highly educated people, than on those with low levels of education the thought-provoking “Is psychological wellbeing linked to the consumption of as does eating more fruit and vegetables?” (also with Oswald), which linked rises in happiness and mental health to the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables and, with another academic, David Bell, the provocative “The Scots may be brave but they are neither healthy nor happy”, which found the wellbeing of Scots lower than that of the English or the Welsh.What is striking about all this work is its consistency. Blanchflower first identified a U-shaped happiness curve in a paper published in 2007, which found that “wellbeing reaches a minimum, on both sides of the Atlantic, in people’s mid-to-late 40s”. One point from Blanchflower’s studies is that no matter where you are, money can’t buy you happiness. His latest work – carried out when unemployment is at historic lows in many countries – confirms this. He pinpoints 47.2 as the age of peak unhappiness in the developed world, and 48.2 in developing nations.“The curve’s trajectory holds true in countries where the median wage is high and where it is not, and where people tend to live longer and where they don’t,” Blanchflower says in the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. But this is not to say that our wellbeing is independent of external events.“The onset of the Great Recession (following the banking crisis of 2008) seems to have particularly impacted the prime age and especially those with low levels of education,” Blanchflower, 67, told me via email from Key West, where the temperature was 27C and he described himself as happy.In the US, he says, the academics Angus Deaton and Anne Case have documented deaths of despair especially relating to these groups from suicide and drug poisonings.Blanchflower’s work suggests when people are at their least happy, but not why. Attempts to bridge this gap, to meld the fields of economics and psychology, became fashionable shortly after the millennium and then bled into the political world. Since 2005, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has published its How’s Life? survey, which charts the wellbeing of people in 41 countries. In 2007, the economist Richard Layard was made the UK’s happiness tsar. The next year, the French president Nicolas Sarkozy asked the rock-star economists Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz and Jean-Paul Fitoussi to find alternatives to GDP as a measure of a country’s health. The idea was revived last year when the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pledged her government would put wellbeing at the centre of its budgets.While Blanchflower believes politicians now understand the need to take happiness seriously, he fears they do not appreciate their role in its delivery. “They are getting happiness more but I think we need to understand that politicians imposed failed reckless austerity, which broke down social ties even more.”As the west endures an explosion of depression and loneliness, society must look itself in the mirror, says Blanchflower, who thinks the keys to happiness are “friends, family and a supporting community”. “It seems society does value happiness more these days but not enough – we are having an explosion of depression and loneliness. In the US, pain is up even though 100 billion pain meds are distributed, according to the Washington Post.”If Blanchflower’s work is correct, politicians keen on improving wellbeing need to prioritise middle-aged people, which seems counter-intuitive given the pressures facing younger people today. As Layard writes in today’s Observer New Review: “The rise in competitiveness has been made much worse by the advent of social media, which have encouraged self-advertisement and made more young people feel inadequate, anxious, depressed and ‘left out’.”But there are compensations for being young, Blanchflower argues. “Young people have more energy and fewer responsibilities!” he emailed, the exclamation mark revealing the fervour with which he holds this belief. He has a theory as to why we hit a nadir in our 40s: “Life seems to get complex and it is a struggle to strike out on your own.”This strikes a chord. Before my 40s I had few cares. Life was simple and many places – schools, hospitals, doctors’ surgeries, creches, nurseries, playgrounds – were alien to me. Now that I have a child, a wife and elderly relatives to consider, life is a shuttle between these places.I have a job that has resolutely plateaued for the past two decades and, thanks to familial responsibilities, a squeezed disposable income. I crave sleep. My body is disintegrating. I spend my time obsessing about air pollution and knife crime.And gradually something is dawning on me: I will never represent my country in any sport no one is going to be calling me from Sweden with an invitation to collect a Nobel Gregg and John are never going to say to me: “Mate, that was an awesome tiramisu.”And yet there is something hopeful in Blanchflower’s U-shaped curve and its promise that after 47.2 lies a better tomorrow. As Blanchflower says: “Once you get there, I think you get more realistic – and happier.”Indeed, if I have learned anything as I hit the age of 47.2, it can be summarised in the observation of Frank Bascombe, the main character, aged 44, in Richard Ford’s The Sportswriter. “For your life to be worth anything, you must sooner or later face the possibility of terrible, searing regret – though you must also manage to avoid it or your life will be ruined. I believe I have done these two things. Faced down regret. Avoided ruin. And I am still here to tell about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19eb48a15af495eca4ef08adb1ce76f203f005d5/0_255_8658_5195/master/8658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a47dd17531933fc6a4729310f7db39","title":"try novella ditch snobbery five ways to read more books","story":"Reading is good for the brain and the soul, but we don’t always find the time, the inclination – or the right book. That can be easily changedStruggling to find the time to read could suggest you are reading the wrong books. Sian Cain, the ’s books site editor, says people often aspire to read books they feel they “should”, rather than ones they actually want to read, then end up putting them off. “Get over your snobbery, as there is literally a book for everyone out there.” John Rampton, an entrepreneur who has written about building a voracious reading habit, adds: “If I go for one or two books that are just OK, my rhythm gets thrown off.”Marvin Marcano, a personal development coach who reads a book a week, says ersifying your reading – more genres, or more than one book on the go at once – will inevitably result in you reading more. “This way you make it a priority because it’s fun. If you get burnt out, you can always go to something else.” If you are a very slow reader, try novellas and short stories so you can finish a book before you lose interest.Rampton schedules time to do it – typically 15 to 20 minutes, twice a day, for his commute. Over a working week, that comes to roughly three hours of reading, even without the weekends. “I have to block out time for this on my calendar or it won’t happen. Other things will take priority if you let them.” Joining a book club can help with this by committing you to finishing a book before a certain date. Katie Cunningham, a journalist who completed her new year resolution to read 52 books in 2019, says joining a library was a “gamechanger”: “You have a hard deadline to get it finished by.” If it is an ebook or an audiobook, it’s still a book. If you have a podcast habit, Cain suggests making the switch to audiobooks, which can be consumed on your commute or at the gym. “If you look at your phone a lot when you know you could be reading, download an ebook app. I do this when I know I’ll be standing, which was my excuse for not reading on the train but staring at my phone anyway.” Cain always has an ebook on the go – “while also having a print book for comfy reading”.Services such as Blinkist that condense books into “key takeaways” are increasingly capitalising on the desire to read more books in a shorter period of time. “It is not the equivalent of reading,” says Cain. As with exercise, making time for reading becomes easier with repetition. “It is 100 times easier when you’ve made it a habit,” she says. “Even setting your alarm for 30 minutes before you’d normally go to bed, so you can spend that set time in bed reading, is a good idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b29f8665719a7bcd97bff51c41f54c42dabb2a/0_94_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dba510dcf2ed597b8ddfd3164dc8e56","title":"share your experiences of once in a lifetime jobs","story":"After hundreds apply to run a café on a remote Irish island, we’d like to hear about your one-of-a-kind job experiences Do you dream of quitting the rat race and moving to a remote island to run a B\u0026ampB, book shop or animal sanctuary?

It was the debut in 1988 of an exhilarating, in-your-face artist, slotted between the soft seasonal balms of Freiheit’s Keeping the Dream Alive and Kylie and Jason’s Especially for You. She was 24, visibly pregnant, dancing in a gold bra, gold jacket and huge medallion, and doing something else that felt revolutionary: rapping.The next day, our school playground filled with little girls delivering words into one another’s faces that they didn’t quite understand, trying to get the rhythms right. It didn’t matter: Neneh Cherry’s Buffalo Stance, and its attitude, had entered our world. Cherry was by no means the first female rapper with a distinctly British style – there had been several female duos and groups before her – but that uncompromising, joyous, performance can be seen now as the moment mainstream pop opened up to artists like her, and laid the groundwork for the next three decades of solo female MCs.Raw Like Sushi, Cherry’s debut album, went platinum the following summer a long-overdue glossy reissue arrives this month to mark, belatedly, its 30th anniversary. “Rap was freedom,” Cherry says today. You could find your own way within it, your own form of expression, and that felt like a big thing as a woman. There’s something very powerful within rap, anyway. You’re not dependent on the words working with the melody. You can just pour out what you really want to say in an unrestricted way.”To discover where British rap began, it’s useful to first take a trip to America: specifically to Long Island, New York, in the late 1970s, where the teenage Neneh was living in a loft with her artist mother, Moki, and her adoptive father, jazz trumpeter Don. Cherry had a boyfriend who lived nearby, in the Queensbridge Houses public housing development, where the early roots of hip-hop were stirring. “He was a DJ, but there were also guys whose job was to announce the DJs, and it quickly became about these people introducing themselves, too. Saying: ‘This is my name, my street, where I come from.’ This was long before freestyling, but it was interesting even then: it became about talking about who you were.”Cherry left that scene behind (“me and my boyfriend broke up, and I got into punk”) but then in 1980, she heard a record that made her “see the light”. This was Vicious Rap by Sweet Tee – New Yorker Tanya Winley, whose father, Paul, ran a label that had formerly released doo-wop, but now released Malcolm X speeches (these were later sampled by Public Enemy). “As a record, it was raw – it felt like she had delivered her words in two takes, on fire. It had a quality like Aretha Franklin had, or Patti Smith had. Sweet Tee had power and independence: total ownership of the space she was in as she was doing it.”“But when you hear those words and delivery from a woman, it’s something else. A male voice can prompt many feelings, sure: love, longing, even anger sometimes, when you’re female. But when a woman hears a woman like that…” She exhales. “It’s a ticket to somewhere else. It’s an experience.”In the 1980s music industry, it felt to her that women needed to change the conversation. Cherry had always noticed powerful, creative women in music, but saw that other stereotypes persisted, like the over-sexualised girl, or the “nice girl writing sweet lyrics about how life is bitter and painful, longing for babies and love. I felt all the same stuff, but I loved how rap took those lyrical ideas in a different direction. It was less about ‘I’m sitting here waiting for you, where are you?’ It was more: ‘I’m here. This is how it is. What the fuck?’”Buffalo Stance took this attitude and ran with it. It began life as a B-side and alternative version to pop duo Morgan McVey’s single Looking Good Diving (Cameron McVey has been Cherry’s partner since then, and is father to her two daughters: Tyson, the baby in the Buffalo Stance bump, born in 1989 and pop star Mabel, born in 1996). Its genesis is sweetly ordinary. Cherry wrote the line “who’s that gigolo on the street?” walking out of a corner shop near Earl’s Court. Its famous middle-eight line “What’s he like? What’s he like, anyway?” is Cherry doing an impression of Fat Tony, the main DJ at London’s underground Wag Club.“They was a playfulness there: it was totally from the heart, and totally from my life,” Cherry says, “but it was also from this fearless space.” The other rap tracks on Raw Like Sushi were similarly bold. So Here I Come slams a first kiss “hit and missHe wasn’t impressed ’cos I wouldn’t get undressed”. The Next Generation asks men “to love us Through thick and thin with your heart and your soul not the size of your dick”. My Bitch’s berating of a man for wanting to make a girl could also be British female rap’s manifesto. “I ain’t playing I’m to be taken seriously You know what I’m saying?”Rap records featuring women had started to break out in Britain before Cherry, however. Sheryl Garratt, a journalist for the Face before becoming editor in 1989, saw first-hand how rap was influenced by reggae soundsystems in cities like her native Birmingham. There, toasting (lyrical chanting over reggae rhythms) was an obvious, close relative to rap. “This also meant people were rapping in their own accents from the start. It was about people trying to stand out from each other in their own peer groups. Hearing something half in Jamaican patois, half in pure Brummie, where I was from, felt very natural.” Cherry herself got involved in soundsystems when she moved to the UK, being a regular at Bali Hai in Streatham, and meeting the Wild Bunch in Bristol, who she mentions on Buffalo Stance: they later morphed into Massive Attack.Women were a visible, welcoming presence in the US early rap scene too, Garratt adds. She recalls going to New York, aged 18, to interview Sugar Hill Records’ CEO and Rapper Delight’s producer Sylvia Robinson (“she was good fun, really friendly”). Hip-hop gigs at Manhattan’s Roxy Roller Rink were also full of young women, and many performed, like Angie Stone’s early rap group, the Sequence, Roxanne Shante and MC Sha Rock of the Funky 4+1. “Being at a roller-skating rink, of course, that world was full of girls. It felt natural that they were part of the early rap culture.”They rapped over electro and hip-hop, practised in their bedrooms, front rooms, and for free at the Battersea Arts Centre, and slowly became aware of other hip-hop communities in London they’d join other rappers and breakdancers for jams in Covent Garden, which became a crucial meeting point for the culture. Women were always at these jams as crowd members, but not as participants, Pryce remembers. “Being the only female on a line-up was the norm to us, but we loved the challenge.”Tim Westwood’s 1987 documentary Bad Meaning Good chronicles this scene, interviewing Cookie Crew and another female duo, the Wee Papa Girl Rappers a year later, both had top five hits (Cookie Crew’s was Rok Da House with the Beatmasters). Pryce says she was constantly asked if they were as good at rapping as men. “We never understood why – we would often end up turning the interview on the journalist and asked them what they thought.” This antagonism played a pivotal role, though, she says, in the growing confidence of female rappers. “These experiences only inspired us to be better and stronger.”Other British women emerged, like the She Rockers, featuring a young Betty Boo (raw footage exists online of them rapping with Public Enemy in a London McDonald’s), and Monie Love, who eventually had a global smash, It’s A Shame (My Sister). After them, the 90s was a quiet time for women, with movements like daisy age hip-hop being superseded by gangster rap in the mainstream. Garratt noticed bikini-wearing or halter-necked women increasingly used as window-dressing in videos for men: “In the 90s, rap started to turn into a business.” The British music industry was also more interested in post-rave dance music and Britpop as profitable genres.The mechanics of touring – which helped embed and sustain a longer career –was not set up to help women starting to have families either, Garratt says (“although that’s not a rap issue, it’s just a music industry issue”). Cherry’s career continued because she had a supportive family and management team around her Garratt remembers interviewing Cherry for The Face in 1996, when both women had babies. “We were breastfeeding them in a hotel garden in the South of France while we spoke – it was amazing. But that rarely happens. It usually takes a village, a soundsystem culture or a family, to help a woman keep going with their career when they’ve had kids.”The 2000s saw British female rappers return to the charts, but having short-lived bursts of mainstream success. The most prominent, Ms Dynamite, first attracted attention for her quickfire patois-heavy style on two huge 2001 garage hits – DJ Sticky’s Booo! and So Solid Crew’s Envy – but she’d ditched rapping entirely on her Mercury prize-winning debut album, A Little Deeper, for palatable soul. She also had a son, Shavaar, in 2003, and her mainstream career died down. Interestingly, she returned to her original love after that, rapping on Katy B’s 2010 single, Lights On, and a solo single, 2011’s Neva Soft she continues rapping in the underground today, with a huge fanbase.Estelle also hit big with her single 1980, in 2004, before becoming part of a wave of British female rappers criticising the industry for a lack of support. “The record labels just don’t know where to go with us,” she told the ’s Alex Macpherson in 2008, after she’d decamped, successfully, to America. 2009 Mercury winner Speech Debelle also highlighted a lack of openness to different styles within rap, after releasing Speech Therapy, full of woodwind-soaked narratives about her experiences with homelessness and an absent father, more in line with the 2010s spoken-word world of Kate Tempest. “I’m not black enough for certain black radio stations,” she said.Grime perhaps provided the better launchpad for female MCs, and still does. One of the first to emerge from this scene was Shystie in 2004, who was taught to rap by male friends in Tottenham’s Broadwater Farm Community Centre. Being female helped in her early days, she believes. “It helped me get more focus and attention because I was different, and I grabbed it. I couldn’t believe I was this little black girl from Hackney, controlling the audience.”Her debut single, One Wish, was a pirate radio hit, and the No 1 video on satellite urban music TV channel Channel U, but mainstream radio had other ideas – as Estelle’s 1980 was also being released at the time. “I was told several times that there was only one space for a woman. It was disheartening and upsetting, but there was nothing else I could do: my mainstream career was dependent on the few gatekeepers who decided the playlists.” One Wish got to No 40 Shystie’s career went back to the underground.But a few years later, something happened that changed the rules of success. “Social media meant that British female rappers suddenly weren’t dependent on anyone any more. Everything’s there at the girl’s hands through YouTube, Twitter and Instagram: creativity, an instant platform, people that could help you, and an audience.” Shystie herself has a project being announced later this month that couldn’t have happened without it the last decade of British female rappers also shows women defying the industry, unapologetically saying what they want to say, running their own worlds.British female rap is arguably in ruder health now than it has ever been, though much of it still operates outside the mainstream. Take Birmingham’s Lady Leshurr, who turned down a deal with Atlantic Records in 2013, after they offered her $250,000 to start a feud with Nicky Minaj: she produced and edited seven brilliant Queen’s Speeches on YouTube instead, full of quick-witted, Brummie-inflected freestyles about relationships and society. There’s Ms Banks, who supported US rap megastar Cardi B while still unsigned, and Little Simz, who released her third album, the Mercury-nominated Grey Area, on Age 101, a label that helps distribute artists’ music, without them giving up ownership. On 2015’s Persons, she’d rapped about how people would say: “The industry will break you, Simbi”. On Grey Area’s Venom, she was more direct: “Fuck those who don’t believeThey would never wanna admit I’m the best hereFrom the mere fact that I’ve got ovaries.”A broader range of experiences are being expressed by this new generation of British of women, too. Take Peckham’s Flohio, rapping about Grenfell against heavier, darker electronics, or Poetic Pilgrimage, using rap to explore their Muslim beliefs. Or Lioness, back rapping after taking six years working a normal job in London, finding her voice again. The brilliant Ffsytho, who raps (and tweets, often hilariously) about her identity as a gay woman and the world around her, also finds rap a useful tool (she spent her teens learning rap, she explains, enthusiastically, by playing DJ Sticky and Ms Dynamite’s Booo! on repeat). “I suffer with my mental health, so I put a lot of my rage into my lyrics. It feels like a weight has been lifted every time I spit venom.” Ffsytho’s been told she reminds people of Neneh Cherry too. “She’s proper legendary, like the British Queen Latifah. I love her old school flow, a bit like storytelling. I want to work on something like her style, and bring that old school to the new school.”In 2020, it feels like rap for British women is about confidence in one’s own identity above anything else. They are proudly visible and audible – and will be even more so if the music business supports them as it should. When Cassie Rytz, the 17-year-old star of recent BBC3 grime documentary Galdem Sugar, describes the rush of experiencing rap, for example, she does so with the same joy that Neneh Cherry felt 40 years ago. “I get an adrenaline rush whenever I start spitting. It’s being opinionated with a beat behind me. My story gets told to an audience, and it gets taken more seriously.” She’s seen things changing in her short time in the business too, she says, with stations like Rinse FM having much more gender equality in programmes and line-ups. “More people are beginning to wake up and become more aware of the barriers females face within this industry.”Neneh Cherry, turning 56 in March and still making brilliant music, remains excited as well: “There are so many women today doing beautiful things and beautiful work. And what excites me most, to be honest, is women realising that being strong is not about being aggressive for the sake of it. It’s about expressing yourself boldly and with humour, but also showing your vulnerabilities, and asking for help, without overexposing yourself.”I’m 10 again, watching Cherry on TV in her gold medallion, giving birth to a new feeling, helping us girls all become something else. “That is strength. That is power. That’s being a woman.”Raw Like Sushi: 30th Anniversary Edition is released on UMCVirgin on 30 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f07cd9cb7259ffcb5f4a354e890ec01eba458b8/500_385_2459_1475/master/2459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=706e279bc5f2a9e682b2a6680a3acf5c","title":"street scene review opera north leeds grand","story":"Grand, LeedsOpera North’s striking production of Kurt Weill’s opera is beautifully achieved with moments of dramatic fireFirst performed in Philadelphia in 1946 before a Broadway transfer the following year, Street Scene, now given a fine new production by Opera North, is in some respects the most ambitious and arguably the finest work of Kurt Weill’s American period. With lyrics by Langston Hughes and a book by Elmer Rice, based on his own 1929 play, it depicts 24 hours in the lives of a largely immigrant community in a tenement block in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, which in turn throws into relief the central narrative of Frank Maurrant’s murder of his unfaithful wife, Anna, and the impact of the tragedy on their daughter, Rose, and her shy Jewish boyfriend Sam Kaplan.Like many of Weill’s later works, it’s in many ways unclassifiable and at times uneven. Weill himself described it as “an American opera”, but it hovers in territory uniquely its own, somewhere between opera and musical. Big arias such Anna’s passionate Somehow I Never Could Believe are juxtaposed with Broadway numbers like the breezy Wrapped in a Ribbon and Tied in a Bow, and jazz collides with Rossini in the ensembles in which Anna’s neighbours gossip about her adultery. At times, however, you can’t help but feel it overreaches itself. With more than 30 roles, the cast is large by any standards. Some of the characters aren’t developed as much as one would wish, and the narrative focus can become blurred.Opera North have done it proud, though. This is very much a company show: all the roles are taken either by members of the chorus or regular guest artists, and there’s not a weak link anywhere. Gillene Butterfield and Alex Banfield are touching as, respectively, Rose and Sam. He sings Lonely House with wonderful depth of feeling she sounds lovely in What Good Would the Moon Be? and the tender fragility of their relationship is superbly captured. Giselle Allen, meanwhile, has real dramatic fire as Anna, while Robert Hayward’s Frank is a complex and often remarkably empathetic portrait of a man disastrously ill at ease with his own emotions.Elsewhere, there are some superbly observed character portraits, among them Quirijn de Lang as Rose’s dangerously seductive boss, Harry Easter, and Dean Robinson as Sam’s father, Abraham, the leftwing intellectual, inveighing against social inequality and longing for revolution. Weill provides his Italian immigrant Lippo Fiorentino with a big number about ice-cream, which Christopher Turner sings with great panache. James Holmes conducts with impeccable style, and you would be hard pressed to hear the piece better played.Matthew Eberhardt’s striking production, meanwhile, locates the work firmly in the time of its premiere, but avoids the naturalistic approach favoured by some directors. The staircases and platforms of Francis O’Connor’s set suggest the outline of the tenement block while allowing us to see the comings and goings within, and the central hallway light rises to become the moon as Rose and Sam dream of a better life elsewhere. Fiorentino has become a second world war veteran and local hero. With sinister irony, the Maurrants’ young son, Willie, continuously plays with a toy gun – a dreadful intimation of his father’s eventual murder of his mother. It all makes for fine, engaging music theatre, beautifully done.• At the Grand, Leeds, until 28 February, then touring until 20 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04e0549a43a06f42963c42fd49b408b7c002662/0_0_5097_3059/master/5097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6781a1de31ad534265af2fd13ba7ef7","title":"where did it all go wrong for harry and meghan podcast","story":"Hadley Freeman looks at why, 20 months after the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the couple no longer want to be full-time working members of the royal family.

The Labour party lost millions of voters because they failed to listen.”The crumbling Palace of Westminster is due to be vacated for several years from 2025, under plans for restoring the historic buildings by the Thames.Shifting the Lords to northern England during that period, and potentially permanently, would be a symbol of Boris Johnson’s determination to “level up” the rest of the UK with the capital. The decision is expected to be made as part of a constitutional review, to be launched in the coming weeks.The Conservatives have already said they will open an additional campaign headquarters outside London.Cleverly told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: “When the prime minister stood up the day after the general election and said this is going to be a people’s government, he meant it. And that meant connecting people with government and politics.“Because the referendum in 2016 wasn’t just about our relationship with the EU, it was about millions of people and their relationship with politics as a whole. So we’re looking at a whole range of ways of connecting people, in the kind of places where we won representation for the first time in decades.”The potential move to York move was welcomed by many of the city’s political leaders. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, described the idea as “incredible” and said she would write to Johnson to back the move.She added: “We would get infrastructure improvements, particularly for transport. It would create hundreds, thousands of jobs, good quality jobs.”Keith Aspden, the Liberal Democrat leader of City of York council, also cautiously welcomed the proposal. He said: “It is about time that the government lived up to its promises to York and the north, particularly with transport and infrastructure investment.”He said the proposed site, next to York rail station, was among the best in the north of England and would attract “high-quality occupiers”.“We welcome any conversations and genuine attempts to decentralise the country,” Aspden added.However, there was a more mixed reception among members of the public. One person said it could take York back to “the prestige it had in the Viking period”, while another said: “Please spare us. Additional demands on the health services and hundreds more blue badge holders cruising round the city centre and abandoning their vehicles wherever they feel like it.”Commenting on a story in the local newspaper about the plans, one man said: “Send the sleeping chamber to the sleepy city.” Cleverly was also asked about the controversy over whether Big Ben would “bong” to mark Brexit – at 11pm (midnight, Brussels time) on 31 January – but sought to play it down.After House of Commons authorities said it would cost £500,000 to sound the bell, which has been silenced during renovations to the Elizabeth Tower in which it hangs, Johnson said his government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.It subsequently emerged there was no such plan – and it is unclear what will happen to the money raised by crowdfunders for the project. Instead, the government will project a countdown clock on to the wall of 10 Downing Street on the evening of 31 January.Cleverly said: “The PM made a light-hearted statement about Big Ben. Trust me, this is not the most pressing issue in government. There’s a lot of interest, and it’s fun, and it’s good media knockabout.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c52b2da0f5df3b5cfb38569266a8727c0b30f5b0/0_10_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=692617c7e66ea9d43d465460b5d34d2f","title":"highgate cemetery runs out space","story":"It is the most exclusive location in Britain. A plot in Highgate’s east cemetery, resting place of Karl Marx, George Eliot and Malcolm McLaren, will set you back £20,000. In the west cemetery, where lie George Michael, Christina Rossetti and Michael Faraday, a plot costs double.“We have a reputation for being the most expensive cemetery in the country,” said Dr Ian Dungavel, chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, a charity that rescued the site after decades of neglect. “That’s not something we have deliberately chosen to be, but I think it relates to the value of land around the place. Where land values are highest, grave values are highest.”Yet, despite the hefty price tags, demand for residency in this city of the dead is outstripping supply. The east cemetery will be full in about four years and the west in 10, leaving the London borough of Camden without an operational cemetery. This is why the trust wants the law changed so that certain graves can be reopened and reused, a process it describes as “grave renewal”.A private member’s bill, which will this week receive its first reading in the House of Lords, would “authorise the trust to extinguish rights of burial in grave spaces, and to disturb and reinter human remains in graves in order to increase the space for further interments in such graves”.The trust, whose upkeep of the cemetery is entirely self-generated, must walk a tightrope between the needs of the living and the dead. Around half its income comes from the 70 burials each year. Most of the remainder comes from the 100,000 visitors who each year pay to walk around the graves. The cemetery also makes money as a film location. Hampstead, starring Diane Keaton, and Fantastic Beasts 2 – in which it doubled for Paris’s Père Lachaise cemetery – were filmed there.“This is not going to result in the removal of great Victorian headstones they’ll stay where they are,” Dungeval said. “Highgate is a very strange cemetery in that we make half of our money from visitors coming to see us – either paying to wander around the east cemetery or on a tour around the west. It would be suicidal for us to start removing the heritage that people come to see.”The cemetery, which now has 53,000 graves holding 170,000 people, was established by a private member’s bill in 1836, so an act of parliament is required if it is to be granted new powers. Only long-abandoned graves, where the last burial was more than 75 years ago, would be considered for renewal. Notices would be placed in the press, on the internet, at the cemetery entrance and on the grave. Attempts would be made to contact the grave owner.If a relative objected, no renewal would be considered for a further 25 years.Highgate’s space problems are not uncommon. A 2013 survey found that almost half of England’s cemeteries claimed they would run out of space within 20 years. A quarter said they would be full within a decade.Many of its graves reflect the social changes that have swept Britain’s cities. Massive population growth in the late 18th century saw the Victorians build large urban cemeteries offering family graves where members could be buried together. But as people became more mobile, moving away from where they grew up, such graves fell out of favour and were left untended and under-used.A sample area of 200 graves examined by the trust found that 53 graves had no headstone, 37 were of sufficient depth to have two more human remains interred and 14 an additional one.“Some may see this as interfering with the dead in a way that is inappropriate,” Dungeval said. “But I would make the observation that throughout the centuries the dead are rarely left to lie as they were. The injunction ‘rest in peace’ typically refers to the soul rather than the body. What we are proposing is a balance between those promises that were made and the needs of the present generation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26693f20471fa42b0c0bd4872414d9321c7e545f/0_346_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1646e91e1cd1f37eb2eb87cf822611a6","title":"housing giants put profit before peoples needs report reveals","story":"Charlotte Denning and Conor Green were overjoyed when they moved into their first home on a new hillside housing development on the northern fringes of Plymouth. But the reality of living for three years on an estate designed by housebuilding giant Persimmon has been frustrating in many ways.“Almost every house has young families in, but there is literally nothing here for kids at the moment,” said Denning, 23, as a ferocious storm lashed the windows of their living room in Palmerston Heights. “They have to play on the road. Sometimes we move all the cars, so they at least have somewhere to run around.”Their experiences are far from unique. Matthew Carmona, a professor at University College London, whose team has surveyed new housing schemes across the country as part of a major forthcoming report, says big developers are producing too many estates with serious design flaws. “At present we are just not meeting the basic requirements for civilised living that we should expect in a country like our own,” he said.Carmona claims housebuilders are not investing enough in good design, especially in less affluent areas. “These are large companies making a lot of money out of housing development and having a huge impact on our country. They should be building sustainable estates which stand the test of time and allow communities to thrive,” he said. “Anything else is just not acceptable.”The worst new estates lack nearby amenities such as shops, pubs and cafes. They are unconnected to surrounding areas, with few public transport links. They lack enough green spaces and playgrounds. They do little to encourage cycling and walking. The architecture is standardised and undistinctive, with affordable housing sometimes concentrated in particular areas, rather than mixed in with private homes.Denning and Green, who are both in the armed forces, said residents in Palmerston Heights needed to use cars nearly every day because there were few amenities within walking distance. “You have to get in a car to go to McDonald’s or KFC. The nearest pub is 20 minutes away. It’s not like popping over the road,” said Denning.Other residents voiced similar complaints. A mother in her 30s said there was nowhere for kids to go on the estate. “People drive really fast around here,” she says. “I’m a bit of a worrier, so they can’t go out on their scooters as much as I would like.”The closeness of the homes makes housing association tenant Ashlie Austin, 24, feel uncomfortable. “Everything is so squeezed in, so close together,” she said. She gestured down her hallway towards a window overlooking the rows below: “You can see them in their bathroom. I don’t like it and it must be hard for them.”There are few places for people to get to know each other nearby. Janette McPherson, 48, said she only spoke to one neighbour. “I don’t know anybody really,” she said, keen to get out of the rain. “I’ll probably try and sell as soon as I can. It feels really claustrophobic.”Local architect Mark Pearson, who assessed the estate for the UCL report, which was backed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said it was one of the worst estates he had visited in the south-west. “The cumulative effect of all the design flaws and the isolation of the estate make it a miserable place to try to exist,” he said.The design code for the development, which will eventually see 873 homes built across 32 hectares, specifies distinctive architecture and a high-quality, accessible environment. But, Pearson, who is the executive director of the Architecture Centre Devon and Cornwall, said: “Residents have got the opposite.”The original plans for Palmerston Heights included a gently sloping diagonal street, but permission was later sought for it to be replaced with steep steps. “It would be impossible for disabled people or people with prams to navigate,” he said. “People that were less mobile are virtually trapped in their homes.”Persimmon, claimed Pearson, created the overlooking problems by giving over too much space to parking and opting for conventional two storey homes rather than the split-level homes mentioned in the design code. “It would have been a way of integrating the slope into the built form rather than just making platforms to stick conventional houses on,” he said.The streets are laid out with parking spaces in front of most houses and no storage for wheelie bins. “You have got to navigate around a bin or car before you get to the doorbell. It looks shabby. It doesn’t instil pride in a place, which is an essential ingredient in making a community,” he said.Pearson argues that big developers are putting profit before good design. “It is immoral. It is the systemic whittling away of design quality in order to increase the profits going to shareholders and paid out in bonuses.”A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes said: “Palmerston Heights has been developed according to plans that have been approved by the local authority following extensive consultation. This process is the same for every developer nationwide.”Last year, the housebuilder completed 15,855 homes and made an annual profit of £1.09bn – the biggest ever reported by a UK housebuilder.Local planning departments don’t always have the resources to challenge the worst schemes and are under constant pressure to approve new homes. “Councils are really reliant on big schemes to boost housing numbers,” said Carmona. “They try to tweak their plans but often they don’t have the capacity to even get the basics right.”Almost half of local planning authorities have no dedicated in-house design capacity at all according to UCL research by Urban Design Group charity in 2017. Carmona wants the government to make it clear that badly designed schemes should not be getting through the planning system, while reducing our dependence on private developers to deliver new homes. “The national planning policy framework states poor quality design should be refused. But substandard development is getting through because housing numbers trump other concerns,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1454265c3af3aadb64d7051e3228c7a74f8feebb/0_61_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01776e8a7b878ea6bfffd27b72c60ff7","title":"cameron norrie australian open pierre hugues herbert","story":"• Briton hopes ‘results will come’ at Australian Open• Dan Evans welcomes Tim Henman’s advice in SydneyCameron Norrie does not lack for heart or self-belief but it is difficult to see him getting out of the first round at the Australian Open against the inventive Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert on Monday.As hard as he tried for Great Britain in the inaugural ATP Cup in Sydney last week he struggled when confronted with quality shots coming back at his steady stream of ground strokes. If Herbert has a strength it is the ability to change tack in an instant. A soft-handed doubles specialist with a singles ranking of 64, he is sharp and intelligent anywhere near the net and patient near the baseline.Still, Norrie was in upbeat mood on Sunday when looking back on an indifferent week in Sydney, where he lost to an inspired Nick Kyrgios and the experienced Steve Darcis, and had decent wins over lesser lights, Moldova’s Alexander Cozbinov (810 in the world) and the Bulgarian world No 323, Dimitar Kuzmanov.“I had a great pre-season,” he said. “I feel really fit and strong. I had a tough start to the year in the ATP Cup. Auckland was tough, not being able to defend after making the final last year. That was difficult. I am playing a lot better than I was last year, which is good, I am just not getting the results. Hopefully I can make a run here and we will see.”The run needs starting blocks – and Herbert will be disinclined to make it easy for Norrie, who remembers him from a qualifying match three years ago in Vienna. “He’s a tricky player. It will be good ... What style? He is pretty aggressive, likes to come forward, serve and volley a lot. He can be pretty solid from the ground as well. I need to focus on what I can do and go out there and compete.”There is nothing complicated about Norrie’s tennis. He makes a consistent effort to lengthen the exchanges until he is ready to properly go for a winner but it just did not happen for him in Sydney. He took great heart from the experience, especially from his talks with Dan Evans, whose career has shown an encouraging upward graph since he took Roger Federer to two tie-breaks in the second round in Melbourne a year ago.Evans, Britain’s top-ranked player in the continuing and worrying absence of Andy Murray, plays the American Mackenzie McDonald, while Kyle Edmund opens against Dusan Lajovic, so impressive for the winning Serbia team in the ATP Cup.Norrie says of Evans: “He has always been an unbelievable player and I am happy he has got everything together with the competitiveness, getting to this level. Everybody knew he could play at such a good level. So it’s nice to see him taking that confidence, getting a lot of wins.“He got a career high the other day, which was sick to see. Hopefully he can push the other Brits along. I practise with him a lot and we always have competitive sets. I spend a lot of time with him on the Tour. I’d pick his brains on certain things. He is pretty knowledgeable about the game. I will use his experience to try to follow after him.”The idea of Evans being a mentor would have been viewed sceptically a few years ago but he is a changed man. He has ridden his rediscovered game intelligently, grinding down opponents with his wicked backhand slice, and is keen to get in behind his serve if it lands well. Those attacking instincts came to the fore in Great Britain’s brief time with Tim Henman, as Norrie acknowledged.“I liked it a lot. There was a lot of noise, a good atmosphere. For me it was difficult to bring my level. There were a lot of distractions to me but I really liked the event, to have the team atmosphere. When I lost a match, the team got me through it. I was able to play the next day. They were almost able to get me through against Australia. It was a cool format.“To have Tim there was sick because I don’t really know him that well. It was nice to spend time with him on the court and pick his brain. He is very experienced and has a lot of good things to offer. He helped me and my coach as well. It was good for both of us.As well as being one of the game’s more determined competitors, Norrie is a good listener. If he wins on Monday, he may owe Henman a thank you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021c03787b97e8081e509e663908a14c26784e6/0_244_4883_2929/master/4883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86dffa6e39d2f61ba6f57734d2ead119","title":"conor mcgregor next opponent ufc nurmagomedov mayweather diaz","story":"Shortly after Conor McGregor had dispatched Donald Cerrone within 40 seconds in his UFC comeback on Saturday night, attention turned to the Irishman’s next opponent.Dana White, the UFC president, was quick to talk up the prospect of a rematch with the undefeated lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. The match-up would be a huge moneyspinner after their last fight, in October 2018, ended in acrimony and violence. McGregor taunted his Russian opponent before that fight, and made negative references to his Muslim faith. Worse was to come when Nurmagomedov ended up brawling with some of his opponent’s entourage after defeating the Irishman. Both men received suspensions and fines for their part in the tawdry scenes. “We’re looking at Hagler-Hearns,” White said. “We’re looking at like Ali-Foreman, Ali-Frazier. This is a massive fight with global appeal. It’s the fight you make, it’s the fight that makes sense. It’s for the 155lbs title … Khabib is the fight to make. It’s huge for Khabib’s legacy, too. If he beat Conor McGregor, then he beats Tony Ferguson, then he beats Conor McGregor again, I mean this is how this kid, when he retires, he’s 30-something-and-0 and he’s beaten all of the best.”Nurmagomedov is due to fight Tony Ferguson in April, and on Saturday McGregor hinted he did not want to wait while the Russian recovered from his next bout. There could also be a move away from mixed martial arts. After Saturday’s bout, Floyd Mayweather posted a fake promotional advert for a rematch of their 2017 boxing fight. That contest earned both men tens of millions of dollars, even though the quality of boxing on show was debatable. Mayweather, one of the greatest fighters of all time, won that fight in 10 rounds after toying with McGregor, who had never boxed professionally before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9af13e838cc3b1de4afe5bafc6c3a8ea1b2ac4e/0_138_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae35d4da54c06c69a01d71f83988cd8c","title":"lisa ashton creates history as first woman to win pdc tour card","story":"Lisa Ashton has become the first woman to win a PDC Tour card at the qualifying school in Wigan.

Given the truly extraordinary backdrop, with the club’s relegation to the Championship next season now signed and sealed and the abyss beckoning, it was one of the more remarkable displays of backs‑to‑the-wall grit the tournament has ever known.Because, until a 75th-minute Owen Farrell penalty finally nudged a 14-man Saracens home in an emotion-laden contest, this was threatening to be the day his club’s citadel walls finally came tumbling down. A loss or a draw would have consigned them not so much to disappointment as outer darkness. All their remaining games between now and June would have counted for diddly squat, with relegation guaranteed and the rump of this team resigned to this being their last big game together. Farrell’s three points did not just save the day, it arguably preserved his team-mates’ sanity beneath a flawlessly blue north London sky.Had the unfortunate Billy Vunipola not sustained a broken forearm and his replacement Will Skelton not been given a red card just before half-time for a reckless high hit, victory might conceivably have achieved more easily. Then again, very little about Saracens’ present predicament is easy, self-inflicted or not. How do you prepare a team for a big game in the knowledge that, win or lose, your world is crumbling?No wonder their club captain, Brad Barritt, spoke afterwards like a man currently grateful for small mercies. “In many ways it is as good a feeling as it ever has been,” he said. “In the face of adversity, the way guys fought together is a moment we can be very proud of.”He accepts, however, that his sporting life has been turned on its head. In no particular order the club must now work out which players stay and which will have to go, get their heads around the implications of a new life in the Championship and try and restore, at least from the public’s perspective, what remains of the champions’ integrity. Some creative suggestions have already surfaced – friendly matches against southern hemisphere opposition to keep players interested, for example – but there is no escaping the stark reality of their new diminished status.“Everyone is gutted I don’t really need to speak more than that,” Barritt said. “We have spoken at length this week and it is a bitter pill to swallow. People have given their lives to this club, the better part of their careers. Everyone is devastated about it but we weren’t going to let it define us today.”Barritt also expressed the wish that “the core of this group will stick together” but, in the same sentence, he acknowledged that “things are going to change”. While speculation about leading players going to Lyon has already been rejected by the Top 14 side, no one knows how many will stay.“It is uncharted territory and if I said now I have the plan, I’d be lying to you,” said Barritt. If, however, Eddie Jones is keen for certain England prospects to be playing regular top‑level club rugby, those iniduals may have little choice.European tournament organisers have already confirmed there are absolutely no circumstances – even if they win this year’s event – under which Saracens can now feature in the Champions Cup as a Championship side. That means they cannot be involved in the elite European competition until the autumn of 2022 at the earliest. Their director of rugby, Mark McCall, said he had “no views” on the idea that Saracens should hand back some of the titles they won during the years they broke the salary cap but did not duck the question of enforced squad alterations.“There is no doubt the bunch of players we’ve got in our squad now aren’t going to be the same bunch of players that we have in the Championship next year. That is for sure,” he said. “In many ways this is the end of an era, from the start of 2009. We have got some time to plan for a new journey … that is the optimistic way of looking at it.”For a good number, though, a premature ending looms. At times initially, before the departure of Vunipola and Skelton, who had to go for making heavy contact with Brice Dulin’s head, it was like watching the magnificent Sarries of old. They ended up winning this particular battle but the real war – regaining the wider game’s respect – is only just beginning.Games to be played 3-5 May, home teams first"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e93890e5099c669a7fc569951ddd218975362b57/0_167_4286_2572/master/4286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=550fc8fae3cb78a5cafe98576f86c754","title":"south africa england third test day four match report","story":"There has been much talk of Joe Root’s consistency since he has been made England captain but here at St George’s Park he has been landing the ball on a length often enough to cause South Africa great concern.Root took four vital wickets in the second half of another grey day and England are on the verge of another Test victory. At the close South Africa, who were compelled to follow on 290 runs behind, were languishing on 102 for six and in desperate need of a lot more rain on the final day to escape with a draw.Bowling around the wicket Root propelled fast off-breaks, sometimes touching 60mph the ball gripped and turned often enough to torment frontline batsmen. There was nothing flukey about his dismissals either he found the edge of the bat or the middle of the pad against players who were usually defending dutifully.Figures of four for 31 were comfortably his best in Test cricket and such a performance offers fresh scope for the tour to Sri Lanka. Like another Yorkshireman who captained England, Ray Illingworth, Root could end up bowling quite a lot when the ball is turning.While Root was taking his wickets, Dom Bess, the first innings hero, was playing the Tony Lock role of Manchester 1956, though he looked more bemused than exasperated that his captain was causing so many more problems than he was.Root took his wickets in an unbroken spell of 19 overs throughout the afternoon. In the morning England needed only 4.4 overs to take the last four wickets of South Africa’s first innings. This set up their victory charge perfectly especially since the Eastern Cape has recently been enveloped in cloud and showers abound.The tail were blown away in spectacular fashion – the stumps were splattered three times – by Stuart Broad with one vital assist from Sam Curran. The fifth ball of the day from Broad nipped back and passed through the considerable gate (note the spelling since we must not cause offence) of Vernon Philander before knocking a stump out of the ground.In the next over Curran followed suit his delivery was not quite so devious but Quinton de Kock pushed forward casually and once again the ball sailed through a wide space between bat and pad. In Broad’s next over Keshav Maharaj was also bowled, off the bottom edge. South Africa were sinking fast in what was a titanic start for England.Kagiso Rabada produced the solitary run added to South Africa’s overnight score before driving straight to mid-off.This deprived onlookers of a long look at Dane Paterson, which may have been a pity. Apparently Dane bats like a rampaging Viking and he has the figures of an old-fashioned tailender to prove it. In his first-class career he has scored 1,171 runs and 852 have come from boundaries, 69 of which have been sixes.After such a stunning start even Broad must have been keen to enforce the follow-on – he has never been a keen proponent of that strategy – and Root had no hesitation in doing so. South Africa had mustered 15 without loss when rain intervened for two and a half hours.On the resumption Mark Wood took his first Test wickets since playing against West Indies 11 months ago. The quality of all that practice in the nets or on a lonely square has been demonstrated. Despite no first-class cricket since that match in St Lucia Wood was in rhythm and on target in the first innings. In the second he found some reward, having already discomforted the upper order.Another Wood delivery in excess of 90mph brushed the outside edge of Dean Elgar’s bat before removing his off stump. Then he removed Zubayr Hamza who was caught down the leg-side by the wicketkeeper this happens so frequently now the notion of a “strangle” should be banished. By doing so Wood has probably removed Hamza from the team for the time being. Temba Bavuma may well be recalled.Root’s first wicket came just before tea, when Pieter Malan, who had been batting so slowly he made Dom Sibley seem like a modern Barry Richards, pushed forward to a delivery that turned enough for him to be lbw.After the break, England squandered their two reviews in 19 balls when Root (over-excitement) and Bess (inexperience) spied lbws that were never there.Such wastefulness did not deter Root from bustling in from the Duckpool End against batsmen uneasy against the fast spinning ball. Rassie van der Dussen pushed forward and the bat-pad nick required Pope to e full stretch to his left to take the catch.Wood’s effort at backward point to catch De Kock off Root was in the same class he had to leap high to pluck the ball out of the air. Next Root dispatched Faf du Plessis in classical fashion, via another catch at short-leg by Pope, who is destined to field there for a long time now.Apart from the silly reviews there was one strange blemish just before the close when a relatively straightforward chance from Philander was dropped by Ben Stokes at square leg off the bowling of Wood. It seemed as if Stokes did not see the ball, which ended up striking his ribcage.He was furious with himself but for some reason there were very few stern looks from his colleagues – just surprise he had dropped another one. Otherwise all smiles in the England camp at the discovery of another demon off-spinner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f9014538a1171d73bd34d2d5fcd18e6fde722b/0_0_3500_2270/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa206cdca349d63a4f1704b88c73c008","title":"south africa england third test day four live","story":"Joe Root took four wickets and Mark Wood impressed as England left South Africa on the brink of defeat in Port ElizabethAnd that’s all from me. A great day for England which puts them in the driving seat for a 2-1 lead going into the final Test. Fabulous to see Mark Wood back in the wickets, let’s hope those six overs on the trot at the end don’t give him too much gip overnight. Spinmeister Joe Root still in the market for his first five-fer. South Africa can’t have a prayer, unless the weather switches again. Thanks for all the emails and tweets - remember play starts at tomorrow at 8am GMT. Good evening!Mark Wood is on the mic, and as excellent as always: “A good day, it certainly started different to how I expected it. The pitch isn’t doing much for the seamers but Broady and Sam have done brilliantly.It’s not been a pitch where you blast people out so plenty of hard work ahead.“Obviously the pitch wasn’t that responsive the first time around, so it was a case of getting the stumps into play and seeing what happens. With a new ball you have to take that risk. a crucial session for us at the start of play. If there hadn’t been the weather around we might have batted again.How do you balance what you want to do and what the skipper wants to do? “I’m happy to do what the team needs, trying to create rough for the right-hander. No reverse-swing here today, tried to look after the ball but not happened for us. It is a bit lush and with the weather around it has dampened the ball.”The South African coach Mark Boucher is now under the pump. He’s brtutally honest “I’m disappointed. We were outskilled. I’ve got to find a way to get the players up mentally and upskill them in the shortest possible time to help them get a better performance out of them. Mentally the guys are probably switched on but it’s about understanding the situation. A new ball, you have to take care of that, things that you expect the guys to know but perhaps they don’t. Joe Root is quite difficult to play, one that slides on, one that turns, the harder you try, the quicker you sink. “Yes, when you’re under the pump for long periods of time, every side has a breaking point, but our breaking point was early today which was disappointing. We talk about plan A and plan B but sometimes you have to change your game plan. “There’s no place to hide in Test cricket and ultimately our nation wants results but I want to compete. The captain is disappointed, we’ve got a Test series on the line and lots of things have been said in the media but he’s trying really hard. I don’t make any excuses, the off-field pressures are no excuses.”62nd over: South Africa 102-6 (Philander 13, Maharaj 5) Philander eyes up a Root leg-side bouncer and, despite it being the last over of the day, flays it for four. Root approaches the umpire with his empty bowl, but is told no. No extra half hour. Still -an unbelievable day for England and one to forget for South Africa. The forecast for tomorrow, by the way, is now pretty good.61st over: South Africa 97-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 5) Ok, this was the penultimate over of the day as Bess rushes through and Maharaj plays him out. One more over before the clock strikes for Root to clutch his five-fer.60th over: South Africa 97-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 5) A quiet Root over, the penultimate of the day. And I’d meant to reply to Quinn’s tweet (below). Steve Waugh was a pretty handy golden arm in that Australian golden age.59th over: South Africa 96-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 4)  Philander pulls a Wood bouncer like a wet gaberdine and it flies to backward square leg where it hits Stokes hard and sprays through his hands and hits him in the ribs as he slips backwards. I’m not sure he picked it up at all - which might focus the umpires’ minds. Incidentally, that is Stokes’s fourth drop this Test. 58th over: South Africa 93-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 1) Philander sprays a Root juicy long hop inelegantly through mid wicket for four. The umpires have a long chat and glance up at the floodlights. 57th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) A Wood maiden, as South Africa play the survival game. 56th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) Big lbw appeal against Maharaj by Root, but it doesn’t impress the umpires and England are out of reviews. Gabriel andor Juliet write: “If Archer comes back for Johannesburg, who makes room? Curran has done his usual solid and excellent thing, Wood has been electric, and both have added depth to the batting in this match. Who gets dropped? Stokes?” Eeek. Bess?55th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) Wood rockets a ball just past Philander’ flying elbow, and he survives. Wood also goes sprawling in the PE dust for the first time today in his follow-through, something he takes in typical smiling stride.A fascinating email on Wood’s action from Scott Roberts, “I disagree with Mike Selvey re Mark Wood’s back foot. I work with javelin throwers, and in my opinion his ‘front on’ back foot is exactly what you’re looking for when throwingbowling. I come across countless throwers (including myself) who have a ‘lazy’ or ‘dragging’ back foot that lands parallel to the crease and all it does is create a lazy right hip (for the right handed bowler) which doesn’t drive at the target, meaning the left hip (again for the right handed bowler) has to work harder to rotate over the front foot, whilst also creating far more chance of injury to the left hip, right groin and lower back. Lastly, if the right hip drives more efficiently, the bowler’s weight is more evenly distributed and they can generate far more torque and consequently bowling speed.”54th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) Just one off the captain’s over. Root’s best bowling figures are bringing much musing from OBO-ers.John Starbuck: Perhaps Root is becoming so successful a bowler because batsmen don’t take him seriously (a captain bowling just because he can), rather like Atherton was. The problem with this is that it’s a law of diminishing returns the more he takes wickets, the less goofy he can appear and he loses the surprise element.53rd over: South Africa 86-6 (Philander 3, Maharaj 0) An eventful over from Wood, who steams in as the conditions darken around him. Eight overs left today, with the option, if the umpires agree, for the extra half hour. Philander slams a pull square which Sibley leaps, grabs, and then drops, before Philander and Maharaj nearly run each out, just beating a ing stump-crash by Wood. And the band play on.52nd over: South Africa 83-6 (Philander 0, Maharaj 0) Just seen that catch again, a simple-ish two-handed plop high into Pope’s hands. Sensational bowling by Root today! His batting average is now higher than his bowling average so can he pin the badge of all rounder?du Plessis reviews after chewing the fat for four or five seconds, but no matter. He is out, a huge inside edge onto his pad which billows out to Pope at short leg. South Africa who have lost 10 for 83 today.51st over: South Africa 83-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 36) Wood not as incisive as Root. Which is not a sentence I ever expected to write. “Root should do the decent thing here and take himself out of the attack in order to avoid getting a five-for, or he might undermine Bess’s confidence having done the same by devaluing the achievement,” muses Tom vd Gucht, somewhat harshly. “As the captain, he needs to be pumping up his team’s tyres, not saying, “Anything you can do, I can do better!” 50th over: South Africa 83-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 36) Root delves into his box of tricks and flicks out a leg-break that turns into a bouncer that digs in a quarter of the way down the pitch and du Plessis swivel-thuds through mid-wicket for four.Graham Thorn has been watching the swaying, bending, palm trees: It’s no wonder England are bowling well in these conditions - theyappear to have brought some of Manchester’s finest summer weather with them to Port Elizabeth.49th over: South Africa 79-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 32) Wood replaces Bess and hares in. Du Plessis edges him through second slip, or rather where second slip would be, if England had one.48th over: South Africa 74-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 27) Philander survives the Daemon Root. Michael Robinson writes: “All the talk of who has been England’s best all rounder during the last but I don’t remember anyone mentioning Root. Incredible stuff from him today, amy idea what his bowling average is?”It was 24 at 52 before this match, I think.46th over: South Africa 74-5 (Philander 03, du Plessis 27) de Kock out for the second time today, a shot he’ll want to wipe from all memory banks. A shot you might play after discovering you’ve dropped a purse bulging with fifty pound notes down the drain. Root now has bowled eight overs, 3-11.de Kock has a moment of madness, playing a free-wheeling golf shot against Root which flies off the back of the bat to Wood at backward point, who times his leap to perfection and grabs it high with both hands. 45th over: South Africa 74-4 (de Kock 3, du Plessis 27) de Kock’s shots have a lovely flow to them as he defends and drives Bess away. Tis windy out there - the flags jigging a merry dance. On the radio they think it is gusting wildly, yet to decide on direction.Some thoughts from Selv on Mark Wood:44th over: South Africa 72-4 (de Kock 2, du Plessis 26) Root bowling wide of the crease and has a huge appeal against de Kock. The ump isn’t interested and replays show the ball probably pitching outside the line, and an inside edge too for good measure. That’s drinks, as Derek Stocker dreams of the Peak District.43rd over: South Africa 71-4 (de Kock 1, du Plessis 26) Bess round the wicket to de Kock who prods and pokes him away.42nd over: South Africa 71-4 (de Kock 1, du Plessis 26) du Plessis breaks the spell by sweeping Root hard, for four. 41st over: South Africa 66-4 (de Kock 0, du Plessis 16) Nowt much happened. Just waiting for the unplayable Root. For those still looking for commentary:40th over: South Africa 66-4 (de Kock 0, du Plessis 16) Such a sensational catch by Pope, who was not only wearing a helmet but also chewing gum. England bounce about in delight. Van der Dussen had been dropped at leg slip by Dom Sibley (a sharp chance) two balls earlier. An acrobatic flying leap by Ollie Pope at short leg, ing to his left, and with his left hand plucking the ball high from behind him and clutching it in as he falls. Eye Popping! Van der Dussen had prodded forward one time too many, and got an inside edge onto his pads which plopped up tastily.39th over: South Africa 66-3 (van der Dussen 10, du Plessis 16) Bess bowls full, but du Plessis plays him away without too many problems.

Born in Buenos Aires, she joined the Royal Ballet when she was 16 and became a principal at the age of 20. Now 37, she is in her prime. She excels in the big ballerina roles in the famous 19th-century classics – she’s just finished performing Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty and will be soon playing OdetteOdile in Swan Lake and Tatiana in Onegin. Known as “Nela”, she was married to fellow Royal Ballet principal Thiago Soares for four years.You were performing leading roles with the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires by the time you were 14. What made you love ballet so much?I don’t know! When I was three, I went to a school where the teacher had her studio in a garage, and she would take the car out and we would do lessons there. But by the time I was five, I said to my mum, this is not for me. I want to do ballet and I want to do it properly. It wasn’t a game, I wanted to take it seriously. That determination was in me from a very young age. I think you are born with a calling. Otherwise you can’t explain it.When you first arrived, having danced all round the world as a rising star, you had to go back to school because you were too young to join the company. Then you joined the corps de ballet and became a soloist. Was it hard to go backwards in that way?It was a big adjustment. Apart from the fact that I was living in a new culture with no English, I was also in a big institution and things slowed down. For someone so young, I didn’t quite understand that, and I wanted things to happen immediately. But now, looking back, I wouldn’t change it, because it gave me such a strong base, so by the time I got to do the main parts I had a better understanding of everything.How does it feel to be returning to Tatiana in Onegin, which you first danced with Royal Ballet in 2015?It’s one of those ballets where everything is served to you on a golden tray. It’s a masterpiece that always works. I understand it better the more I dance it. We first meet Tatiana as a young girl and then see her as a mature woman. I feel I can understand and live her from both angles and I have such a lot of admiration and respect for her.When you have a holiday from the Royal Ballet, you take on guest appearances with your other companies. Do you feel that your time is running out?No, it’s mainly because I love being on stage and I just want to dance. It’s what makes me happy and my body can take it, which is a blessing. I literally love doing everything. The dramatic, the classics, abstract ballets. I am a complete bunhead! When I am not dancing, I am watching dancing. Also, I genuinely feel that ballerinas become more interesting when they become older. When you watch them, it’s not just a body doing incredible stunts, it’s something in their eyes, how they move their hands. There is so much depth there. I want to achieve that and explore it.What would you say to those people who say they don’t think ballet has much to offer?It’s our responsibility to make people get it. When I’m dancing, I always think – even when I am in a fairytale ballet such as The Sleeping Beauty – that it is real. It touches me and it makes me think of my life it should have that impact when you’re watching. Some people always say that ballet is elitist and it’s definitely not. It is this beautiful piece of art, unfolding live in front of you, not like something in a museum.Do you have any regrets?I only see my family once or twice a year, and I wonder if at some point I will feel I didn’t spend enough time with them. But even as I say that, I know my parents would tell me not even to think it. They are so proud of me.You always seem such a happy person. Do you ever get sad?I can be really sad, and I can dance and it’s not a problem. I think when I dance, I can just accept any kind of emotion and just carry on. Dance is always there to hold me.Nuñez dances Tatania in Onegin (21 Jan 8, 27 Feb) and Odette in Swan Lake (5, 12 March 1, 16 May) at the Royal Opera House, London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460fa5bc975bf98df21ed426cf09a88d5cd151a0/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b94f18755e66e1ed0629e22de0918211","title":"coronavirus china reports 17 new cases of sars like mystery virus","story":"Experts worried about the disease’s spread during lunar new year period of mass travelChinese authorities are to step up efforts to contain the outbreak of a new virus before the lunar new year holidays amid fears of the bug spreading to other countries.Health officials in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, confirmed 17 new cases of the Sars-like coronavirus on Sunday, including three patients who are said to be in a severe condition.The new strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed more than 750 people globally in 2002-03.Adding to those concerns is the imminent movement of hundreds of millions of Chinese who will be travelling to visit family during the holidays that start next week, increasing the potential for the virus to spread further afield.“Our commission will step up our guard during the spring festival, pay close attention to the development and change of the epidemic, and direct the implementation of prevention and control measures,” China’s national health commission said on Sunday, adding that it believed the outbreak could be controlled.Of the 17 new cases confirmed in Wuhan, three were described as severe and two patients were too critical to be moved, authorities said.Two people have died from the virus in Wuhan, the largest city in central China. Three cases have been confirmed abroad – two in Thailand and one in Japan, involving people either from Wuhan or who had recently visited the city.The virus has infected 62 people in Wuhan, with eight in a severe condition, 19 cured and discharged from hospital, and the rest remaining in isolation where they are receiving treatment. Those infected have ranged from 30 to 79 years old.Authorities said they had begun “optimised” testing of pneumonia cases across the city to identify others infected, and would begin “detection work … towards suspected cases in the city” as a next step, as well as carrying out “sampling tests”.The World Health Organization said on Sunday that some of the new cases did not appear to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, the suspected source of the outbreak. “The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan seafood market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan seafood market into the community,” David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told Reuters.Wuhan’s deputy mayor, Chen Yanxin, said oversight would be strengthened at big events and the number of public gatherings would be reduced, state media reported. Since 14 January, city officials have used infrared thermometers at airports, railways and other routes into the city to screen passengers, but their task is being hampered by this being the peak of the influenza season.Chen said passengers with fevers were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions, with nearly 300,000 body temperature tests carried out, according to CCTV.Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London said in a paper published on Friday that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700 – much higher than the number officially identified.No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan’s health commission has previously said the possibility “cannot be excluded”.Authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland.The US said from Friday it would begin screening direct flights arriving from Wuhan at San Francisco airport and New York’s JFK as well as Los Angeles, where many flights connect.Thailand said it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket and would soon introduce similar controls in the beach resort of Krabi.Wuhan is a major transport hub, including during the lunar new year holiday when Chinese people make an estimated 3bn trips around the country to visit family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2ac96f2fe8e72ecb7d89be593b98640bf620f3/0_228_4481_2689/master/4481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b998b8eef9fff0623e46f0f91c0049aa","title":"isabel dos santos revealed africa richest woman 2bn empire luanda leaks angola","story":"Leaks show how Isabel dos Santos became Africa’s richest woman at expense of Angolan stateThe complex financial schemes that helped Africa’s richest woman amass a fortune at vast cost to the Angolan state can be revealed for the first time after a huge leak of confidential documents from her business empire.Isabel dos Santos, who is known as “the princess” in Angola, the oil-rich nation her father ruled as president for almost four decades, has long denied that her estimated $2.2bn (£1.7bn) fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption.However, an investigation by the  and journalists in 20 countries, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), suggests Dos Santos benefited from extraordinary opportunities afforded to her by the government of her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, before he stood down as president in September 2017.The Luanda leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the , the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper\u0026nbspExpresso.The businesswoman, who spends much of her time in London, controls interests across Africa and Europe ning banking, telecoms, TV, cement, diamonds, alcohol, supermarkets and real estate.The Luanda leaks are based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts that was obtained initially by the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), an anti-corruption charity whose work with key witnesses helped topple the South African leader Jacob Zuma. The trove was then shared with the ICIJ.Dos Santos and her husband, the businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, say computers belonging to their employees and legal advisers were hacked. They say they are the subjects of a politically motivated witch-hunt led by Angola’s new president. Through their lawyers, they rejected any allegation of wrongdoing, and vehemently denied being financed by state money. “There is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, it’s completely unfounded,” Dos Santos told BBC Africa. “I can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.”Dokolo described the government actions as “armageddon” and a risk to the economy. The couple say their businesses employ thousands of people in Angola and are among the country’s biggest tax contributors. “We have worked and invested in this country, more than many others,” he said.In an open letter, José Eduardo dos Santos rejected allegations of wrongdoing, saying he had “not transferred to himself, or to any other entity, money from the state”.After a seven-month-investigation, the , working alongside outlets including the BBC, the New York Times and Portugal’s Expresso newspaper, has uncovered documents that raise questions over preferential deals and lucrative transactions with the Angolan state worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The material reveals an opaque network of about 400 companies, many of them offshore, connected to Dos Santos, Dokolo and their associates, and the assistance given to the couple in managing them by a coterie of European and American management consultants, accountants and lawyers.The documents appear to suggest that:• The state oil company Sonangol sold Dokolo what has become the couple’s most valuable asset: a stake in the Portuguese oil corporation Galp, now worth €750m after an initial loan-backed payment of just €11m.• A total of $115m in payments to consultancy firms, ordered while Dos Santos was chair of the state oil company, were routed through a Dubai company controlled by her associates.• A business venture with the state diamond company allegedly resulted in $200m of public debt propping up an ailing Swiss jewellery brand partly owned by Dokolo.• Two Dos Santos companies and their subcontractors stood to collect up to $500m in fees from a Dubai-style real estate development in the Angolan capital, Luanda, that was later cancelled by the new president for “over-invoicing” and “disproportionate compensation”.Three weeks ago, Angola’s attorney general announced a freeze on the assets of Dos Santos, Dokolo and their chief adviser, alleging that their dealings with the country’s publicly owned oil and diamond companies had “harmed” the state to the tune of $1bn.Angolan prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into her actions while at the helm of the state oil company, Sonangol, in September. They are working with counterparts in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, the US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace assets, prevent money transfers and gather information.Dos Santos says she is the subject of a witch-hunt by Angola’s government, designed to neutralise her as a potential political opponent. On Wednesday, she provoked speculation about a bid for the presidency, telling a TV interviewer it was “possible” she would run for office.However, Dos Santos has not visited Angola for more than a year. A prosecutor told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso she was thought to have left the country hours after receiving a request from prosecutors to appear for questioning in July 2018. Through her lawyers, Dos Santos said she had “no record of having received any such request”, and that there was no question of her having refused to meet prosecutors.Dos Santos and her half-brothers and sisters are among the most prominent members of the oligarchy of powerful families in Angola. Her father came to office in 1979 as head of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). After the end of the civil war in 2002, President Dos Santos and the MPLA consolidated power by bringing the most valuable sectors of the economy into government ownership.The spoils were shared with a select group with links to politics and the military. As a result, Africa’s second-largest oil producing nation became known as one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, ranking near the bottom of the Transparency International corruption perceptions index. “These are the classic symptoms of a captured state,” said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK, after reviewing the Luanda leaks findings. “Here we have industry and politics all in one family, with no apparent separation of powers.”The leak includes data from Fidequity, a team of advisers who acted as a family office for the couple, administering their empire from plush premises above a Louis Vuitton salesroom in Lisbon.As the couple grew richer, emails and board minutes show the number of banks prepared to have them as clients dwindled. The data indicates that top-tier lenders severed ties after the Dos Santos regime was ruled a corruption risk by compliance departments.Company service providers in the Netherlands and the Isle of Man also turned down their business, the files suggest. Dokolo says he has been unable to open bank accounts under his own name in London and Paris since 2001.Other European companies appear to have taken a different approach, helping the couple move money and win lucrative contracts from the Angolan state. The blue chip firms PwC and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) collected millions in fees, providing services such as auditing of accounts and management consultancy.PwC, which handled auditing and accounts for Dokolo companies in Malta, Switzerland and the Netherlands, said it had opened an internal investigation “in response to the very serious and concerning allegations” and “taken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the Dos Santos family”.BCG said senior partners conducted regular reviews. “We are proud of and take responsibility for our work, and are strict in adhering to our policies and values,” a spokesperson said.Since taking over the leadership of the country and its ruling party, with the blessing of José Eduardo dos Santos, the new president, João Lourenço, has vowed to fight the “cancer of corruption”. The most high-profile targets of his anti-graft drive have been the children of his predecessor.Isabel dos Santos’s half-brother, José Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial for the attempted looting of $500m from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. He has pleaded not guilty. Her half-sister, Welwitschia dos Santos, a member of parliament, was impeached last year after moving to Britain. She fled after alleging she had been threatened by the Angolan secret service.Dos Santos, however, is fighting back. In recent weeks, she has toured media outlets giving interviews, saying her wealth is the result of hard work and business acumen. Her husband has opened an arbitration dispute in London against the state diamond company, and says he is involved in a second arbitration over Galp in the Netherlands.The Netherlands dispute centres on a loan from the state oil company, Sonangol, which sold part of its shareholding in Galp to a vehicle controlled by Dokolo in 2006. The agreed price was €75m, with Dokolo’s company making an upfront payment of €11.2m and committing to pay the rest at a later date from idends. If the whole amount had not been repaid by 31 December 2017, in euros, Dokolo’s vehicle risked losing the shares.While Dos Santos was chair of Sonangol, it agreed to let Dokolo’s vehicle make the repayment in Angola’s volatile currency, the kwanza. After Dos Santos was sacked from the state oil company, its new managers cancelled the deal and sent the money back. Sonangol is now demanding compensation.Dokolo denies the deal was a preferential one, and said there was “absolutely no wrongdoing”. Through his lawyers, he said that it had been approved after an internal review at Sonangol, and that the state oil company’s purchase of a shareholding in Galp, one of its most successful investments, was originally his wife’s idea and had been negotiated by him.Dokolo said he invested $115m in equity in the Swiss jeweller that his commitment matched that of the state diamond company and that the business “steadily improved” under his ownership.Dos Santos said under her leadership, Sonangol spent far less on consultants than previously. Her lawyers said the Dubai company that handled Sonangol’s payments to consultancy firms was a lead contractor with a formal contract approved by the board of directors, and was not owned by Dos Santos.Challenged about how she has apparently benefited from her father’s decrees, Dos Santos said the president’s role was to ratify government concessions and licences, and that it would be hard to do business in Angola without ever having a decree relating to one of her companies. Her lawyers added that the prices agreed with her companies for the proposed redevelopment of Luanda were competitive, and that the allegations of overcharging were “false and unfounded”.In a sign that the international community is beginning to close ranks against Dos Santos, her name has been removed from a list of participants preparing to meet in Davos this week for the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering of business and political leaders. Her company Unitel had paid to be a sponsor. The event’s organisers said they were “re-evaluating” Unitel’s participation.Additional reporting by Caelainn Barr."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/910ac103bf8120d1eacdc726e0e610683b6ac0be/0_174_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2f6e8b671f9d3531888894e5cde0c25","title":"two popes plotting cardinals francis benedict celibacy rules","story":"Benedict and his inner circle are accused of intervening to halt Pope Francis relaxing celibacy rules as the battle between conservative and liberal factions takes a new twistThe pilgrims filing into the papal audience hall last Wednesday were mostly oblivious to the saga enveloping the Vatican over an explosive new book that pits the retired Pope Benedict XVI against the reigning Pope Francis. But they were clear on who their favourite is.“I would not have come all this way for Benedict,” said Marisol Durán Vergora, a first-time visitor to the Vatican from Spain. “He is an extremist, whereas Francis is more human and closer to the people.” Another pilgrim, who wished to remain anonymous, speculated after being briefed on the goings-on: “Benedict decided to abdicate and should keep his promise of staying silent.”The ex-pontiff, who chose to be called Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI after his abdication in 2013, instead of reverting to Joseph Ratzinger, is at the centre of a drama that has been more entertaining than the Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes. It started with a book written with the outspoken conservative cardinal Robert Sarah defending priestly celibacy. That in itself would not have caused a stir. But the timing of the book’s release, as Pope Francis considers allowing the ordination of married men in remote areas of the Amazon in order to overcome a shortage of priests, led many to accuse Benedict, who still lives within the walls of Vatican City and continues to wear a white cassock, of breaching his vow of silence and undermining his successor’s authority.In a bizarre twist, after extracts of From the Depths of Our Hearts were published in France’s Le Figaro newspaper last Sunday, the former pontiff demanded that his name be dropped as co-author. His personal secretary, Georg Gänswein, said that while Benedict knew that Cardinal Sarah, who has clashed with Pope Francis in the past, was preparing a book, and had sent him an essay on the priesthood, he had not approved a co-authored project and had neither seen nor authorised the book’s cover.Sarah denied allegations that he had misled Benedict, providing proof of the text that had been given to him and claiming that Benedict was aware that the project would take the form of a book.The French publisher, Fayard, went ahead and published the book as planned, but in future editions Benedict will be named as a contributor rather than co-author. Meanwhile, the US publisher, Ignatius, refused to relent, saying in a statement that the English version would retain Benedict as co-author.Amid the fallout over the book, Vatican commentators picked over its origins, with some saying “the two popes” were the victims of exploitation by the warring conservative and liberal factions within the Catholic church. Throughout his life Benedict has been a prolific writer, but others questioned his capacity to construct such a detailed essay at the age of 92. A Vatican journalist for the rightwing Italian press claimed that it was a furious Pope Francis who ordered that Benedict’s name be removed.Benedict has come forward on a variety of issues over the past seven years, most controversially writing last year that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and “homosexual cliques” among priests were to blame for the church’s paedophile-priest scandals. The opinion came two months after an unprecedented Vatican summit on tackling clerical sexual abuse, and sharply contrasted with that of Francis, who blamed the scandals on a clerical culture that elevates priests above the laity. Benedict also wrote a letter complimenting Cardinal Joachim Meisner – a fierce critic of Francis who spoke out against the pontiff allowing remarried orcees to receive holy communion – who died in 2017.But this is the first time he has intervened, whether knowingly or not, in a matter that the Pope is actively considering. Francis is weeks away from publishing his decision on the Amazon after a document approved by bishops at a synod in October noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have “enormous difficulties” in receiving communion and seeing a priest. If Francis supports the request to ordain married men, it would apply only to those already serving as deacons. The pontiff himself has consistently said that he would never change the centuries-old requirement for celibacy, but critics fear that the Amazon could set a precedent.“In all the times that Benedict has intervened, what he has written is coherent with what he thinks, so this doesn’t surprise me,” said Iacopo Scaramuzzi, a Vatican journalist and author of the book Tango Vaticano. La Chiesa al Tempo di Francesco (‘Vatican Tango. The Church in the Time of Francis’). “They say he may have been manipulated by his entourage, but he was the one who chose his entourage.”The person at the centre of his inner circle is Gänswein, a German archbishop whose dashing looks have earned him the nickname Gorgeous Georg. “I don’t doubt that in all of this drama Gänswein had a role,” added Scaramuzzi. “He is also very conservative and is among the Pope’s opponents.”Robert Mickens, the Rome-based editor of the English-language edition of the Catholic newspaper La Croix, said that Benedict had never dissociated himself from “the minions” who use him.“From the beginning, supporters of the more traditional wing of the church who were not happy that he resigned have tugged at him to keep his voice in the game,” added Mickens. “And he has worryingly gone along with this. We’re in this situation because he did not keep his promise to be quiet.”The Two Popes is a fictionalised depiction of a bromance between Benedict and Francis despite their different ideas, with, in the final scene of the film, the pair eating pizza and drinking beer as they watch Germany play Argentina in the World Cup final. In real life, it is unlikely the two are so chummy, but most experts agree that the relationship, at least until now, has been cordial, with Francis acting graciously in the face of opposition.Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Benedict’s comments on celibacy could scupper the potential move in the Amazon and leave many questions unanswered, especially over how the role of Pope Emeritus would continue.Among those in the queue for a papal audience was Alex Flood, a protestant minister from the US who was in Rome to do research on Catholicism. “I know very little about the politics of the Catholic church but from our perspective, celibacy should be a choice and not beholden to tradition,” he said. “When I speak to Catholics they recognise this, but it’s such an old tradition that the change is uncomfortable.”Flood described the scandal over the book as a “dog-and-pony show that is missing the needs of people”.“It’s akin to watching American politics,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144257.1579355188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"academic calls for election climate change debate among party leaders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwedish climate activist Greta Thunberg holds up a sign featuring the main slogan of her movement, ‘School strike for the climate’. Photograph: Ronald PatrickGetty ImagesA leading expert on climate change Prof Barry McMullin has begun a campaign to have a separate TV debate among party leaders on the issue because of the scale of the resulting crisis facing Ireland. Questions should come from a studio audience composed of a sample of citizens aged between 15 and 35 to reflect the disproportionate significance of the climate crisis for future generations, he suggested.This approach was necessary because the crisis “is entirely different from all other issues in this general election campaign”. It was global in scope, raising genuine existential risk for the stability of all human civilisation within the lifetime of young people already of voting age, Prof McMullin added. “It transcends and dwarfs the other issues: there can be no enduring solution to housing, healthcare, education, economic development, peace or justice unless there is a successful response to the climate crisis.” For Ireland to now play even its minimal fair share in such a global response would require fundamental and disruptive changes in current political priorities, he noted. “It is utterly impossible to do justice to this issue without a full debate devoted exclusively to this one topic, and driven by an audience selected explicitly to represent future generations who are entirely reliant on the decisions being made now.”He quoted from a speech made last year by the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg notably the “need to focus every inch of our being on climate change. Because if we fail to do so, then all of our achievements and progress will be for nothing.” He reiterated her view that with such an outcome “all that will remain of our political leaders’ legacy will be the greatest failure of human history.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill“We need someone like Tony Gregory – he’s one of the only people who did really well here,” explains Joan Murphy (59) from Manor Street as she is canvassed in Dublin 7 at the weekend. Gregory, who was an Independent TD in Dublin Central for 27 years before his death in 2009, campaigned for better housing, in support of female street traders and against the drugs problem that plagued the inner city in the 1980s. “He felt like your next-door neighbour – he wasn’t this politician far removed from society,” Murphy adds as she addresses Green Party candidate Cllr Neasa Hourigan, who nods in agreement.“It’s amazing,” she replies. “He’s still mentioned on the doors to this day.”Hourigan is hoping to become the first ever Green Party TD in the northside constituency, which stretches from the inner city out to Cabra, Phibsborough and Glasnevin. The fact that Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan, a former member of Gregory’s team who won the seat in the byelection that followed his death, is retiring, and Dublin Central now has a fourth seat, opens the door to candidates such as Hourigan and her rivals Gary Gannon (Social Democrats), Mary Fitzpatrick (Fianna Fáil) and Joe Costello (Labour). Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe are widely expected to hold their seats in the constituency, meaning there are two relatively clear openings. “At this stage, with three weeks to the election, anything could happen and I certainly think that we have a good chance to take a seat here,” Hourigan says.PopularAs she walks around Stoneybatter, Hourigan, a full-time carer for one of her children and an architect by profession, proves popular with young people, families and cyclists. “It’s only in the last 12 months with Trump moving to exit the Paris climate agreement and the fires in Australia – it’s real in a way now for people when it maybe wasn’t before.”While housing and health are two issues constantly being brought up by voters, some have more localised concerns. Vera McCormack (69), from Stoneybatter, tells the councillor that Arbour Hill needs to be cleaned up. “That’s the biggest problem here – there’s litter all over Arbour Hill. It’s terrible,” she says. “I’m probably voting Fianna Fáil and I’ll give Fine Gael a vote because I like them at the minute. I am Fianna Fáil originally. This is real Bertie territory, or at least it was.”Burning carLater in the afternoon on Clonliffe Road in Drumcondra, not far from where human remains were found in a burning car last Wednesday morning, an older woman answers he door and asks Hourigan “what about crime?”“Nowadays you can’t even walk down O’Connell Street,” she says. Hourigan says crime is “always part of the discussion in Dublin Central”. “Because we’re a high-population area, we have really quite a disparate population,” she says. “We have people who are quite well off but then we have really high levels of crime, we have high levels of people in addiction.”Green Party MEP Ciarán Cuffe, who ran unsuccessfully in Dublin Central in 1997 before being elected as a TD for Dún Laoghaire in 2002 and 2007, has been assisting candidates such as Hourigan on the campaign trail. “I think there is an opportunity in Dublin Central,” he says. “I think Minister Paschal Donohoe has a safe seat, I think Mary Lou McDonald has a seat here and perhaps Mary Fitzpatrick. Then I think it’s all to play for between Joe Costello, Gary Gannon and Neasa. “Dublin Central is generally not known for surprises but it could result in one this time round.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144518.1579450045!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin promises first time buyer saving scheme if elected","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said that it would be the battles in inidual constituencies that would determine the identity of the next government as much as national polls.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin at RTE on Sunday. Photograph Nick BradshawFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said the electoral battle between Fine Gael and his party will “closely fought” until polling on February 8th and the outcome of the election will be decided in the last few days of the campaign.Mr Martin said on Sunday that it could be the battles in inidual constituencies that could determine the identity of the next government as much as national polls.He also disclosed his party would be unveiling a policy to bring back a Special Savings Incentive Allowance (SSIA) type scheme to help young people save up for deposits on housing. He said his government would provide €1 for each €3 saved up to €10,000. A similar SSIA scheme for the general population was operated between 2003 and 2007.Mr Martin also contended that a series of attacks by Fine Gael on Fianna Fáil on social media in the past few days were counterproductive as Irish people did not respond well to negative campaigning.Mr Martin also vowed that Fianna Fáil would bring in legislation to “smash” criminal and drug gangs in in power. He also promised that a government led by him would implement speedy delivery on key projects such as broadband, affordable housing and health infrastructure.The Fianna Fáil leader was speaking to reporters in RTE after an interview on the This Week programme in which he also acknowledged that Fianna Fáil had made mistakes when last in government.Negative campaigningHe also responded to a weekend opinion poll that showed Fianna Fáil 12 points ahead of its nearest rival Fine Gael.“I think national polls have to be treated with a severe degree of caution. I believe it’s much tighter. I actually belive that the battles in the inidual constituencies will determine the outcome of this eleciont. And it will be a closely fought electoin,” he said.“All our experience tells us from previous campaigns that it is in the last week that people make up their minds. There will be a lot of debate in the coming weeks and polls will fluctuate.“And I have never been a beliver in national polls as the predictor of the outcome of a general election. I also anticipate there will be a fluctuation in polls over the coming weeks and different polling companies with different methodologies will produce different results,” he said.Asked about negative campaigning and attacks on Fianna Fáíl by Fine Gael on social meida, he said: “Some people acknowledge that we played a constructive role in the four to five years.“They juxtapose that along with those attacks and they don’t get it. They don’t get the nature of the Fine Gael attacks and I don’t think they are penetrating,” he said.Earlier on this week, Mr Martin was asked about Fianna Fáil’s record when last in government.Lessons were learned form that expirence and not just by us but by policymakers in general. Over the past nine years we have demonstrated that. I don’t think you could find in the history of Irish opposition politics, an opposition that has been more responsible.”He denied that Fianna Fáil had promised up to €3 billion in spending promised and claimed Fine Gael had announced €600 million in extra spending in the weeks before the election to “soften Uí” the electorate. He insisted his part would stay within EU fiscal rules. He also said the ratio favouring public spending over tax cuts would be at least three to one.On housing and health he claimed Fianna Fáil would be hands on and deliver projects quickly.“Fine Gael has crated this kind of rental society and a rip-off rental culture.“We want to crease a society where home ownership is a realistic prospect again, he said.MotivatorFine Gael is detached. We want to deliver housing fast and we want to deliver projects faster than are being currently delivered.“We are not taking lectures from a party that has a hands-off approach to government.”The Sunday Times Behaviour and Attitudes poll places Mr Martin’s party at 32 per cent while Leo Varadkar’s party has fallen seven points and sits at 20 per cent, just one percentage point ahead of Sinn Féin at 19 per cent (down one). Its previous poll in December put Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on an equal footing at 27 per cent each.Most of the survey preceded the announcement of a February 8th general election by Leo Varadkar on January 14th and over 900 voters were interviewed between January 2nd and 14th, according to the newspaper. The Greens sit at 7 per cent (up 1) with Labour at 4 per cent (down 2).Tánaiste Simon Coveney appeared to see a silver lining in the poll which would “act as a motivator for Fine Gael people and Fine Gael candidates right across the country”. Mr Coveney was speaking on his way into Thomond Park, Limerick, to watch Munster .“I think its going to motivate people to work harder to sell out message to listen to people, and to listen to voters, because clearly opinions are volatile, and we need to work hard, but there are three weeks left in this campaign.”Fine Gael has “a very strong and positive message to sell” he said.“The country today is in an infinitely better place than it was eight or nine years ago. People are back to work, the economy is strong.”However he acknowledged Fine Gael has “work to do in terms of public services, particularly around housing and healthcare”.The Cork TD also acknowledged the controversy surrounding Fine Gael’s handling of a proposed commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary “probably” contributed to his party’s poor performance in the poll.Labour representationSpeaking in Dublin on Sunday, Labour Party leader, Brendan Howlin, said he is still confident his party’s representation in the next Dáil will be “in the double digits”, despite a poll on Sunday showing support of just 4 per cent.The Labour Party was at 4 per cent in the polls before the local elections, but got ten per cent support in the constituencies it actually contested, he said. In the recent byelections, the party averaged 14 per cent in the four contested constituencies, he said.“I am very confident that we will be in double digits,” he told reporters in Dublin. The general election would produce a surprise performance for the party in a number of constituencies, he predicted. “The battles are on the ground, in each inidual constituency.”Asked about the results in the poll for Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, he said he believed the latter party’s poor showing was the result of the “debacle that Fine Gael made of the black and tan issue”, a controversy that was at its height when the poll was taken.At the same press briefing Labour TD Alan Kelly, referring to his party’s contest with the Green Party for votes, urged people to look at parties policies on all major issues, health, education, public services, and climate change, and make “a holistic decision”, rather than voting for a party that “emphasises just one issue”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144598.1579456515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in seeking legal advice over exclusion from tv election debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and Aengus Ó Snodaigh TD, canvassing in the Liberties in Dublin on Sunday.

It shows what we already know.”She attributed Fine Gael’s waning support to the party’s performance on health and housing, but also suggested that the row over the now postponed Royal Irish ConstabularyDublin politan Police commemoration might have been a factor.She accused the Government of making an “insulting mistake” in terms of the proposed commemoration and that it was out of touch with public opinion in relation to the issue.“Whatever the intelligentsia of this country might think, and they are entitled to their view, their views do not tally with the vast number of people across this land,” she suggested.“We want to build a positive future, but we will have not have the bravery of those who fought the Black and Tans insulted or dismissed in any way.“The reaction of people across the people across the board was strong, swift and determined. Despite those who tried to tell the people that we were somehow immature not to remember our history, our past and our identity, I think Irish public opinion has given them their answer.“ There would be no government in Dublin, no RTÉ, no officer of taoiseach or tánaiste except for those who fought the Black and Tans and communities and families know that.“They will not have our past or our patriotic dead disrespected by anybody including a sitting government.”Two debatesHowever, Ms McDonald stated that the row would not be most significant factor in the election.“A certain section of the public are ready for change now and for us, as advocates for a fair society, I believe that we have the policies that can crack the housing crisis and health”.RTÉ television will feature two live leaders’ debates during the campaign, on Monday January 27th and Tuesday February 4th.The first debate, Claire Byrne Live, will see leaders from seven political parties invited to take part.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe leaders of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have made promises to deal with the pension gap for those who are contractually obliged to retire before the age of 67 amid public backlash over the issue.At present the qualifying age for the State pension is 66, having changed from 65 in 2014. This is set to increase again, via further seven-yearly updates, to 67 in 2021, and 68 in 2028.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he will create an “early retirement pension”.“What we’re hearing from people on the ground and at the doors is that there are some anomalies that need to be fixed. And one of those anomalies, in my view, is people who are required to retire before the age of 66, or even before the age of 67, and what we propose to do there is to bring in a transition pension or an early retirement pension like existed in the past for those who are contractually required to retire earlier,” Mr Varadkar told reporters on Sunday.“For those who aren’t contractually required to retire before 67 we think that policy should continue, it was supported by all parties, and it makes sense on a sustainability basis. If we don’t act now it will create a big problem in the future.“Look what’s happening in France for example where they’re going from 62 to 67 in five years and that’s because they didn’t act early enough so a stitch in time saves nine, and I think certainly for people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and early 60s actually making this change is to their advantage.”Mr Martin said the idea of compulsory retirement at 65 has to change.” I would look at graduated retirements. We are losing a lot of experience and expertise which to me dioes not make sense in the context of a society that is living longer.”Sinn Féin has pledged to keep the State pension age at 65.Mr Varadkar also said that a “week is a long time in politics and three weeks is a lifetime in politics and we’re up for the fight but we’re coming from behind.”He was speaking in light of a poll which showed his party 12 points behind Fianna Fáil. “I think the opinion poll demonstrates that there is a real risk, a real danger, that we will have a Fianna Fáil government after the next election. And I would really hate to see that happen because it would mean the country falling backwards.“And we know what happens every time Fianna Fáil gets into power it ends badly. It ends with a boom and bust, it ends with unemployment and ends with us having to wave our friends off at airports when they’re forced to emigrate, and I don’t think anybody wants that.“It would also mean that the Brexit team of the Simon Coveney and Helen McEntee would no longer be representing Ireland in what are going to be crucial talks over the next couple of months when it comes to securing a trade deal with the UK, and that will be really bad news I think for rural Ireland, for the agri food sector, for jobs and the economy,” he said. Earlier on Sunday Labour Party health spokesman Alan Kelly said the increase in the qualification age for the state pension to 67 from next year is one of the main issues arising on the doorstep.The topic is “really, really out there and is coming up on the doorsteps in all the constituences”, he said.“If we are going to go into any government, we are not going to allow this to happen. It is non-negotiable.”The change in the age for entitlement for the state pension was legislated for in 2011, when the Labour Party was in government with Fine Gael.However the party leader, Brendan Howlin, said the measure had already been agreed as part of the bailout deal with with the European Commisison, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (the troika).“The pension age increase was agreed by the Fianna Fáil-Green government with the troika, and passed into law subsequently,” he told The  .“The increase to 67 has not happened yet, and can be stopped now as the country is in a different place with more people at work and the Social Insurance Fund is in substantial surplus.”He said the economy and demographic situation were in much better condition now than had been projected back in 2011.“It is simply unacceptable that people would be expected to sign for unemployment when they should be retired and Labour is committed to stop that happening,” Mr Howlin said.Mr Kelly said that the top issue on the doorsteps was health, and in particular getting access to acute services in the health system.In a briefing with the media on Sunday morning, he said the second major issue that was featuring in the election campaign was crime and he criticised the government for its “lack of actual detailed plans to deal with escalating crime, particularly in certain areas of this country,” citing north Dublin and Drogheda.The third of the three major issues he mentioned was the change in the pension age. Changes to the state pension were contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, which was signed into law on June 29th, 2011.The law provided for a standard state pension age of 66 years for everyone from January 1st, 2014.In addition, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State pension to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Total of 62 cases of novel coronavirus identified in city of WuhanXi Jinping\u0026rsquos name appeared as \u0026ldquoMr S**thole when translated into EnglishAuthorities still battling nearly 100 fires despite heavy rain in eastern parts of countryUS to screen passengers at three major airports arriving on flights from WuhanRescuers save 30 trekkers following incident on Annapurna circuitFacial hair of diplomat, who has Japanese heritage, reminds Koreans of colonisationMany young couples reluctant to have children due to costs orce rates hit recordMelbourne braces for another wave of unhealthy air over weekend\u0026lsquoThese pines outlived the dinosaurs \u0026ndash we had to do everything we could to save them\u0026rsquoBushfires dampened in New South Wales as thunderstorms cause flooding in MelbourneIndustry that has long supported India\u0026rsquos PM and pro-Hindu agenda begins risky rebellionForeign minister pushes back after re-election of pro-independence Tsai Ing-WenThai health minister says it is first confirmed case of virus found outside ChinaAuthorities warn \u0026lsquohazardous eruption\u0026rsquo is possible \u0026lsquowithin hours or days\u0026rsquoVillagers evacuated near Taal volcano south of ManilaAuthorities struggling to clear road after heavy snowfall, rains and flash floodsFavourable conditions allow firefighters to switch from \u0026lsquodefence to offence\u0026rsquo against blazeBeijing says reunification \u0026lsquocannot be stopped\u0026rsquo and accuses Tsai Ing-wen of \u0026lsquodirty tactics\u0026rsquoTaal volcano spews ash and steam, as experts predict further \u0026lsquohazardous eruption\u0026rsquoMilder conditions forecast for next week but crews worry flames will flare up again"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144444.1579440664!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china 17 more people diagnosed with new form of viral pneumonia","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA passenger walks past a quarantine control station at Narita airport in Narita, Japan.

It could also further complicate discussions with Brussels.Talks with the EU already face a daunting schedule this year, with the EU probably agreeing its formal negotiating mandate only in late February and the official transition period expiring on December 31st.

He has been styled an HRH since birth.He was given the title the Duke of Sussex by his grandmother the Queen on the morning of his wedding.American former actor\u0026nbspMeghan Markle became HRH the Duchess of Sussex after saying her vows.Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Saturday: “The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family.”In Queen Elizabeth II’s statement sanctioning their new life earlier this week, the monarch referred to the couple not at first by their official titles.This was taken as the first clue as to what might be in store, with commentators questioning whether there is the prospect of the couple losing their HRH style — and even their royal titles.Their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, is not an HRH — nor a prince — as he is too far down the line of succession from the monarch.Harry and Meghan could have used the courtesy title Earl of Dumbarton for him, or he was entitled to be Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.But they took the personal decision to make him a plain Master, most likely inspired by Harry’s wish to have been a normal child, rather than a prince, as he grew up.Archie will, however, be entitled to be HRH and a prince when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne — although Harry and Meghan almost certainly will not opt for this now.Diana had her HRH style and her title the Princess of Wales removed — becoming Diana, Princess of Wales — following her orce from the Prince of Wales in 1996.At her funeral after her death in a car crash in 1997, her brother Earl Spencer said in his controversial eulogy that the princess “proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic”.The Duke of York’s ex-wife, who was HRH the Duchess of York, became Sarah, Duchess of York after they split.The abdicated Edward VIII became the Duke of Windsor and finally married American orcee Wallis Simpson while in exile in France in 1937, and none of the royal family attended.But he kept his HRH style.A Letters Patent by his brother, the new King George VI, decreed that Edward “having been born in the lineal succession to the Crown” should be “entitled to hold and enjoy for himself only the style title or attribute of Royal Highness”.Mrs Simpson became the Duchess of Windsor, but was never permitted to adopt the style of an HRH, with George VI’s Letters Patent forbidding it. –PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4142810.1579258393!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fundraising drive under way to make big ben bong for brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBig Ben: campaigners want its bell to chime for the first time since restoration work began in 2017 to mark Britain’s departure from the EU on January 31st. Photograph: Will OliverEPAAn online fundraising campaign seeking to have Big Ben ring to welcome in Brexit at 11pm on January 31st has raised more than £150,000 (€175,000).Stand Up 4 Brexit’s “Big Ben must bong for Brexit” campaign had raised £152,470 of its £500,000 target from almost 10,000 donors on the GofFundMe website by Friday morning.Those who wish to celebrate Britain leaving the EU will want to do so in the same manner as New Year’s Eve – by looking at a clock, the campaign’s organisers wrote online.“The natural choice for this would be Big Ben but because it is currently undergoing refurbishment, special measures would have to be put in place, which could cost up to £500,000,” a statement by StandUp4Brexit founder Rebecca Ryan and Mark Francois MP added.“However, because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations, we would need to raise this amount by this weekend.”Mr Francois had earlier accused the House of Commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell, which has been silent since 2017, back into operation.In a video posted on the fundraising site, Mr Francois said he was “delighted to announce that our Eurosceptic colleagues from StandUp4Brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that Big Ben can chime at 11pm on the 31st of January”.He added that the campaign hoped to get contributions “from across the four nations of the United Kingdom, what the prime minister likes to call the ‘awesome foursome’”.Mr Francois said it was “inconceivable” that the clock used to mark the UK’s departure from the EU “could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben”.He finished his appeal by saying “please give an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again”.They added that “Britons are currently donating more than £80 a minute to the campaign, with an average donation of £16”.British prime minister Boris Johnson had said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.Donations to the campaign include £1,000 from Mr Francois, while business secretary Andrea Leadsom promised £10.There were also small donations from “Dominic Grieve”, “Jeremy Corbyn” and “John Bercow” but these were all thought likely to be fake names.Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost £500,000.Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the commission, said: “You are talking about £50,000 a bong.”Whether Big Ben bongs or not, Brexiteers intend to gather outside parliament to mark the UK’s departure from the EU.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the Leave Means Leave campaign group had been been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on January 31st. “It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,” he said. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

We supported the fight against the US with all our hearts.A decade on, however, Mr Obeidi has become an unlikely voice for Iraq\u0027s US military presence to remain. Pressure on America to leave has grown after the assassination of Iran\u0027s top general Qassem Solaimani, who was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad two weeks ago. Youths read a newspaper as they sit by graffiti murals drawn by anti-government protesters along the walls of a traffic tunnel at the anti-government protest sit-in in the capital Baghdad\u0026#39s central Tahrir SquareBut a withdrawal is regarded with horror by many Sunnis, who, for all their past quarrels with the US, see it as very much the lesser of two evils compared to Tehran.If the US leaves, we will be an even easier bite for the Iranians, Mr Obeidi, who now scrapes a living running a food stand, told The .We are no big fans of the US, but they should not leave until such time as the Iranians leave us alone.Mr Obeidi spoke out amid a looming showdown over the 5,000-strong US troop presence, whose main base west of Baghdad was targeted by Iranian missiles 11 days ago.Officially, the troops are only in Iraq to help in the ongoing fight against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), but in retaliation for Mr Soleimani\u0027s death, Tehran has pressured Baghdad to expel them.Already, pro-Iranian factions in Iraq\u0027s Shia-dominated government have passed a non-binding vote in parliament urging the troops\u0027 expulsion.A mourner walk back from a funeral ceremony for Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, passing graffiti on the wall of the former US embassy in Tehran, IranPrivately, however, Iraqi officials fear a pull-out by Washington will hand Tehran even greater influence over the country\u0027s affairs. That fear is expressed rather more openly in Sunni communities, who make up a third of Iraq\u0027s 38 million population.Having ruled the roost in Saddam\u0027s time, they now claim to be treated like second-class citizens by the Shia majority government. Nowhere is that truer than in Adhamiyah, a once-prosperous district of Beverley Hills-style mansions that used to be nicknamed Chelsea-on-Tigris.During the height of the anti-US insurgency, it also became a sectarian battleground, as local Sunni fighters, backed by extremists from al-Qaeda, waged a savage war of tit-for-tat killings against Shia militias bankrolled by Tehran.By 2007, as the Shia militias began to get the upper hand, the US military built a Belfast-style Peace Wall to keep Adhamiyah separate from neighbouring Shia districts. But while the 12 foot-high barrier has since been dismantled, the memories of that time have stayed.    Nearly everybody in Adhamiyah, for example, has a story about losing a friend or relative to the Shia militias, which were trained and bankrolled by Soleimani\u0027s Revolutionary Guards force.While some parts of Iraq staged public mourning ceremonies for Mr Soleimani\u0027s death, here in Adhamiyah, there was private celebration.Qassem Soleimani helped destroy this country, and turned it into the tail of Iran, said Ayad Salman, who owns a shop in a square in Adhamiyah where Saddam made his final public appearance during the invasion.Saddam looked after us and made Iraq respected by its neighbours - now they are all eating away at us. The US has to stay, as the Iraqi government is now on the side of Iran.It is not just grizzled ex-Ba\u0027athists who rejoiced at Mr Soleimani\u0027s passing. So too did protesters in Baghdad\u0027s Tahrir Square, who have been demonstrating since October for better public services and an end to corruption in government.While the crowds are mainly Shia, more than 450 have been shot dead during clashes with security forces. Washington has blamed some of the deaths on Shia militia snipers, allegedly acting on Tehran\u0027s orders to stop an Arab Spring style uprising.An elderly Iraqi woman, her face covered with a national flag, cries as she watches anti-government demonstrators protesting in BaghdadEverybody was happy about Soleimani being killed, although it would have been nicer if we Iraqis could have done it ourselves, said Salim Sadeq Muassim, a retired soldier.When I heard the news I ran to the shop to buy chocolates to give to everyone in the street. My neighbour even grabbed his Kalashnikov and started firing in the air in celebration. We need US troops to stay because they preserving our soul from militia control - if they left now, the militias would shoot us all here.On Friday night violence in Tahrir Square flared again for the first time since Soleimani\u0027s death, with two protesters shot dead. On a bridge over the Tigris, groups of masked youths hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.They were using live ammunition against us, one demonstrator told the  at a makeshift hospital at Tahrir Square.Sunnis in majority-Sunni cities, such as Anbar and Mosul, have largely been reluctant to take to the streets in huge numbers as Shia Muslims have for fear of being accused of extremism or sympathy with Isil.Some have feared it may send the message they are somehow ungrateful to Iraqi forces, backed by Shia militias, which only two years ago suffered huge casualties liberating the two cities from the jihadists.As of yet, no time frame has been set for any final decision on the US deployment. So far, US officials have rejected the move, pointing out that it could damage the fight against Isis.Iraq\u0027s caretaker prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, who took up his post after his predecessor resigned over the shooting of protesters, said last week that the decision should be made by his successor, who may not be in place for months.Many see that as a simply a way of kicking the matter into the long grass - a fudge that could anger Tehran, but will be welcome in America\u0027s former graveyard in Adhamiyah.We need the US here until we get a leader who can rule Iraq without interference from others, said Abu Mustafa, a cigarette vendor. By that criteria, however, America could be here for many more years to come.More than a third of girls say they have been sexually harassed at school, charity survey findsJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s plan to send John Bercow to the House of Lords comes under fireResidents of Florida Keys face losing homes as rising sea levels threaten to cut them offNicola Sturgeon should claim victory of ‘wildcat’ indyref2 even if majority of voters boycott, SNP politician suggestsRepublican leader tells \u0026#39white supremacist garbage\u0026#39 to stay away from Virginia gun rallyComment: A Very British Coup: the political thriller that parallels Corbyn’s rise (and fall)Comment: Harry and Meghan will now have to compete for airtime with other A-listers, and they may struggleChina says mysterious SARS-like virus is \u0026#39controllable\u0026#39 as 17 new cases emerge ahead of Lunar New Year Inside the US \u0026#39therapy\u0026#39 classes where Trump voters and liberals learn how to make friends againComment: The loss of \u0026#39HRH\u0026#39 is a blow to the Sussex Royal brandBritain could help police a ceasefire in Libya conflict, says Boris JohnsonBoris Johnson challenges US over driving standards of  its airbase staff after death of Harry DunnHundreds wounded in Lebanon anti-government protests as police are accused of \u0026#39brutal use of force\u0026#39 Pyrenees glaciers to disappear within 30 years, scientists warn  Comment: The bureaucratic Blob is winning the long war against BrexiteersTrump\u0026#39s lawyers call impeachment charges \u0026#39brazen and unlawful\u0026#39Labour should let women lead it - or risk damaging the party\u0026#39s reputation, warns contender Jess Phillips\u0026#39There are not many white spaces left on the world map\u0026#39: British adventurer on mission to find fabled source of Afghanistan\u0026#39s Oxus River Comment: On the Radar: New brooms at the Royal Academy, a French farce and a big flop for the BarbicanComment: We vain and graceless babyboomers are still bewitched by the cult of youthWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/18/TELEMMGLPICT000221432875_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRo0U4xU-30oDveS4pXV-VlgLjes3EE_nccdZKcRyA5g.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"talented university student becomes latest stranded smart motorway","story":"Zahid Ahmed, 19, was a talented and popular student at Middlesex UniversityDepartment for TransportA student was killed and two others left in comas after their university sports trip ended in tragedy when their vehicle broke down on a smart motorway, The Sunday  can reveal.Zahid Ahmed, 19, died when the people carrier he was in came to a “stop” but did not reach an emergency refuge area before a lorry hit it. Four other Middlesex University students in the vehicle were hospitalised, a sixth suffered less severe injuries. They were returning from a universities pool competition in Birmingham on the southbound M1 near Luton where the hard shoulder was opened to traffic.A relative of one student who suffered brain injuries has said an investigation is needed to establish whether removing the hard shoulder and providing refuge areas roughly every mile puts stranded motorists at risk.Smart motorways use gantries to relay speed and closed lane messages A report submitted to the Bedfordshire and Luton Coroner’s Service says Zahid, whose family fled war-torn Afghanistan, died from “multiple traumatic injuries” when the vehicle “suffered mechanical failure on the M1 smart motorway”.The report adds: “The vehicle was stationary with hazard light illuminated. A heavy good vehicle has then hit the rear … causing significant damage.”The teenager was identified by his student cards, and pronounced dead at the roadside on December 1.The crash shocked Middlesex University in the run up to Christmas. James Kennedy, interim vice chancellor, issued a message to students saying he was “deeply saddened” by the “incredibly tragic” incident.He explained how one student died, four others suffered “critical and serious injuries” and the sixth was released from hospital. It is understood one student in his 20’s who fell into a coma has since regained consciousness.The university offered counselling to those struggling to cope with the tragedy.Jim O\u0026#39Sullivan, Highways England, boss told a select committee smart motorways with a hard shoulder only used at busy times are \u0026#34too complicated for people to use\u0026#34The Sunday  has revealed how motorists and passengers have been killed after becoming stranded in live lanes that used to be hard shoulders, in part because Highways England staff monitoring CCTV cameras covering the network struggle to detect stationary cars and then ert traffic into other lanes. In October, the Government ordered a review into smart motorway safety.Zahid was born in Afghanistan in 2000. His family fled the wars there to settle in North West London where Zahid studied at Crest Academy secondary school.He obtained a place at Middlesex University and was made a ‘digital ambassador’ where he used social media to share experiences of student life.He had also worked as an assistant manager at a local supermarket and did work experience at a local solicitors.His family declined to comment while a police investigation is ongoing.However, a relative of one of the students with brain injuries said: “Smart motorways need to be investigated further.”The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ordered a review into the safety of smart motorwaysClaire Mercer, whose husband Jason died when he became stranded on the M1 and has set up the Smart Motorways Kill campaign, said: “The death toll keeps rising. The only hope is this government actually does something effective.”The Sunday  knows the names of the injured but has chosen not to identify them.A Middlesex University spokeswoman said it was providing support to those involved and “cooperating fully with all relevant authorities in the matter.”Dev Naran, eight, was killed when the car he was in had to stop on the M6  \u0026#39dynamic\u0026#39 smart motorway where the hard shoulder had been turned into a live lane and Highways England controllers failed to spot the stationary vehicleJill Greenfield, of Fieldfisher solicitors which is representing three of the severely injured, said: “This is the most terrible tragedy. One young man has died and three men in their 20’s have had their lives devastated by a collision involving their vehicle and a lorry on a smart motorway.”Claire Mercer has campaigned to prove that smart motorways can be dangerous after her husband, Jason, 44, died on the M1 last yearA Highways England spokeswoman said the incident was “tragic”, their sympathies were with those affected and they are supporting the police investigation so it would be “inappropriate to comment”.A lorry driver has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.Department for TransportThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Most people have known about child labour in factories for decades. After learning about it, as a small form of personal protest I have refused to own anything Nike since I was a teenager. The factory fire in Bangladesh again brought the horrifying conditions of garment workers to light, however the conditions in factories- as well as our consumer habits - to a large extent, remain unchanged.In terms of the environmental impact of fashion and production, the argument is clear cut: produce less waste less. However, aside from the conditions and pay of workers, I find the ethics a bit more complicated. Businesses provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world, so what impact would a decline have on these communities? I will also try to explore these sorts of contradictions (if that is what they are).I know it will not be easy as I can already anticipate challenges such as buying (and receiving) gifts, socks and underwear, home renovation, cosmetics and many others, but I will try my best.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Great. I mean, it would be nice if they notified me. Forewarned is forearmed. They can do anything now. This could be a deep fake interview for all we know.”Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5.

To put that in context, the previous decade saw an average of four rate changes a year.But a flurry of economic data and a series of speeches by members of the nine-strong MPC over the past week have left economists in a quandary over whether the MPC will hold firm at 0.75 per cent or order a cut. “The decision is on a knife edge,” said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics after official inflation figures were published.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat showed annual inflation had dropped to 1.3 per cent in December from 1.5 per cent in November and further below the 2.0 per cent figures that the Bank is mandated to target two years hence.It followed official data for economic growth in November that showed the overall economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in November to leave the rolling three-month growth rate at just 0.1 per cent.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sweden\u0027s Jennie-Lee Burmansson competing in the final run of the Freestyle Skiing Womens Freeski Slopestyle at the Leysin Park in Leysin, during the 2020 Lausanne Winter Youth Olympic GamesFirefighters take part in a demonstration to protest against the attacks against them during interventions in Strasbourg.

That was the fifth consecutive month of no growth, a phenomenon unseen since the 1970s.At the start of the month the snapshot surveys of activity in December showed services flat, a contraction in construction and a seven-year record decline in manufacturing.The value of sterling fell on the foreign exchange markets as traders bet on the odds of a cut in the Bank Rate to 0.5 per cent or even lower.This frenzy was fuelled by a series of speeches by MPC members. Bank governor Mark Carney said that evidence of persistent weakness in activity would favour a “relatively prompt response”.His colleague of the MPC Silvana Tenreyro said her “inclination” was to respond with a rate cut if uncertainty continued to weight on demand, while Gertjan Vlieghe told a newspaper that it would take much to “swing it one or the other”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first is that all the data show what happened in November and December. Since then the uncertainty over Brexit has been removed, at least temporarily, and chancellor Sajid Javid has indicated he will use the 11 March Budget for a spending and investment spree.The second is that surveys covering the period after the election such as the house price reports from Halifax and RICs and the Deloitte CFO survey were pretty upbeat.The second is that the statements by Dr Carney, Dr\u0026nbspTenreyro and Dr Vlieghe were conditional on future signs of a slowdown. With that in mind, traders and economists will be focused on a slew of data over the next two weeks on the labour market, industry and retail sales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto.

(RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett died in the attack,\u0026nbspcriticised the rapper’s new album, too.Feels like he is piggybacking on the fame of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber and says distasteful things about other celebrities,\u0026nbspshe wrote on Twitter.Not clever. Totally pointless. And before all Eminem fans pounce on me, I am not interested and will not engage.Grande’s fans also took to social media to call out the rapper.Eminem previously pledged his support to victims of the bombing, urging his fans to donate money to families whose loved ones had died in the attack.Music to be Murdered By is Eminem’s 11th studio album and his first since 2018’s Kamikaze. It is also the rapper’s third consecutive “surprise” album, and features collaborations with Anderson .Paak, Skylar Grey,\u0026nbspEd Sheeran, and the late rapper\u0026nbspJuice Wrld.\u0026nbspThe album was awarded two stars by The Independent’s critic Roisin O’Connor, who said its “bitter diatribes show he is incapable of moving on”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series.

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But as Oliver Carroll finds out, not everyone is pleasedIt was when the tree fellers arrived in early 2009 with their bulldozers that Nikolai Ulasevich, a local activist, knew the game was up.\u0026nbspThere might not have been a published order to build an atomic power station in the fields overlooking his homestead in the village of Vornyany\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspbut a decision had clearly been made. In authoritarian Belarus\u0026nbspthose decisions rarely have a reverse gear.\u0026nbspIn the years that followed, Ulasevich watched as the gigantic cooling towers and system blocks of Belarus’s first nuclear power station took shape. Construction, which was led by the Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom, would be far from straightforward. A string of incidents delayed its opening, but the first reactor is finally due to go online early 2020.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo say the construction of the Belarusian nuclear\u0026nbspplant has been controversial would be to trivialise the history of these lands.\u0026nbspChernobyl lies only seven miles from Belarus’s southern border, and the nuclear accident, still the world’s worst, has left the deepest of scars locally.\u0026nbspThe direction of the wind in spring 1986 – and the Soviet authorities’ decision to avoid major harm\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspMoscow –\u0026nbspmeant Belarus suffered more than any other region in the union.\u0026nbspAt the moment that\u0026nbspthe radioactive clouds moved towards the capital,\u0026nbspair force pilots were ordered to\u0026nbspchase down\u0026nbspthe toxic clouds and seed them with jets of silver iodide.\u0026nbspMuch of the\u0026nbspsouthernmost region of Homel remains seriously contaminated, with elevated oncology levels as a result. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Illegal tour of Chernobyl visits forgotten sites Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Evening in the ghost town of PripyatA gas mask hangs in a building inside the Chernobyl Exclusion ZoneRemains of Soviet propaganda in one of the barracks of the abandoned anti-aircraft base Volkhov near the Chernobyl NPPThe shell of a television stands inside a building in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA children\u0027s play area inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA Soviet-era classroom in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneTourists inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneDuga was a Soviet over-the-horizon (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet missile defense early-warning radar networkIn the Pripyat abandoned apartments you can still see the abandoned belongings of evacuated residents of the cityAmbulance car model RAF-2203 Latvija (nickname Rafik) on the background of the Medical Sanitary Unit 126 in Pripyat.

They talk about the tiredness the strange, dryness of the mouth the rumours that it might be a good idea to take iodine,\u0026nbspbut the lack of reliable information. They will also tell you about a cloud of secrecy almost as harmful as the black cumulus masses that had their radioactive bowels emptied over southern Belarus.“It was only later that panic had a chance to set in,” remembers Maria Ivanovna, a local hotelier who declined to give her surname. A resident of Astravets\u0026nbsp(Russian: Ostrovets), the main town serving the nuclear plant 10 miles down the road, she says locals were evenly split about the project. Many\u0026nbspare delighted with above-average wages and improvements to local infrastructure – especially the newcomers who have tripled the population since work began. There is a new sports centre, hospital and road connecting to the Minsk-Vilnius motorway. But her generation is “uneasy”, she says.“The thought of what happened back in 1986 can’t fail to make you anxious about what may happen. You know they may not tell you the whole truth.”Lithuania, the European nation that borders Belarus just 10 miles west of Astravets, is bitterly opposed to the nuclear plant. It says it has not been properly consulted and claims the plant breaches post-Fukushima distance guidelines – in particular, a recommendation that nuclear power stations should not be built closer than 100km of major conurbations. The new nuclear plant lies just 30 miles east of the\u0026nbspLithuanian capital, Vilnius.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe Lithuanians say they are preparing for any eventuality: from stockpiling iodine tablets to opening up nuclear bunkers and issuing survival notes to their citizens.\u0026nbspIn October, authorities ran a major preparedness operation, imitating a disaster response to a nuclear meltdown.\u0026nbspThe drills were knowingly hyperbolic. But several reported incidents do\u0026nbspgive pause for thought.\u0026nbspFrom what we know, the reactor vessel in Belarus has already been involved in at least two accidents. The first was in July 2016, when it was apparently dropped from a crane during installation. Belarusian authorities took weeks to admit a\u0026nbsp“minor” incident. Five months later, a replacement reactor vessel collided with a railway pylon while being transported. At least five workers have died in construction accidents. There was at least one fire incident in the control room.\u0026nbspThe outside world would likely have stayed little the wiser were it not for the opposition activist Ulasevich monitoring from his modest home, which he shares with his wife, a few chickens and sheep, three\u0026nbspmiles away from the new power station. He said he found out about the dropped reactor vessel in conversation with a local construction worker.“He swore that he saw it break free of ropes at a height of two\u0026nbspor three\u0026nbspmetres,” he says.\u0026nbspA spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Rosatom tells\u0026nbspThe Independent that allegations about safety issues are “entirely without merit”. The reactors being used are among the safest in the world and designed to risk the possibility of “even the most unlikely event” such as a plane strike. “Anti-nuclear scaremongering doesn’t help to fight climate change”, the spokesman says, “and it appears to be only devised to protect the profits of the fossil-fuel energy sector in the region”.What is drawing thousands of tourists to Chernobyl and killing fields?Others are not so sure. Yury Voronezhtsev, the man who led the official Soviet official response to Chernobyl, says he could not believe any statement that the plant was “safe”.\u0026nbsp“I don’t believe that our Belarusian construction workers are any better than the Soviet ones,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “We have the same people, and the same systems. Don’t forget that Anatoly Aleksandrov, the physicist who designed Chernobyl, assured us his plant was so safe it could be built on Red Square. His confidence did not age well.”\u0026nbspMr Voronezhtsev says\u0026nbspit is\u0026nbsp“sad” that Belarusian authorities pressed ahead with the project given the sensitivity of the issue locally. There is\u0026nbspno obvious justification for a power station given that Belarus had no need for extra capacity, he adds.\u0026nbspBelarus says the power station will be used to meet domestic power needs. But it seems likely that part of the initial plan was to sell electricity to neighbouring Baltic countries, which remain plugged into the Russian grid. A decision by Lithuania to outlaw buying “dirty” electricity from the plant has undermined such rationale.\u0026nbspInstead, the project looks set to pull Minsk ever closer into Moscow’s embrace. Russia is providing the bulk of the financing for Astravets’ £8bn price tag, will be the sole supplier of fuel\u0026nbspand will deal with the radioactive waste.\u0026nbspThe power station plans were signed in a different era, at a time before Russia had expanded its military, annexed Crimea\u0026nbspor pushed Belarus along a path of forced deep integration. Now, such dependence is taking on a different significance.“This is part of a much larger game,” says\u0026nbspUlasevich. “The aim is to develop reliance in all the countries of Moscow’s immediate geography –\u0026nbspwhether by gas, oil or Rosatom. Belarus has simply sleepwalked into the trap.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was shocked by that.It is a magnet for paedophiles because its not policed and anyone can sign up for it.If kids on there are not savvy enough, they will respond to people trying to engage in conversation with them.I see it as a direct way for people of that nature to get in because its not secure in anyway.She added: I cant see how they can police it.Luckily myself and my husband have quite a good relationship with our daughter, who is , and she often sits with me and I have a look at these things on TikTok.Some of the things people on there are doing are very inappropriate...girls that are around our daughters age.In another video, of a young girl stretching, one disturbing  user wrote: Who  got repetitive strain injury of the thumb trying to pause this Another said: You are so f***ing cute.In another video showing two young girls on a bed, one person wrote: You both could get it while another said: I could treat you right.In another video, a creepy user wrote: Whyd you pull your top up for!!!   Meanwhile one user told a girl: I would love for us to get together soon I will be Santa and you Mrs Clause...oh by the way Im Luke.TikTok, which has been downloaded more than a billion times in  countries, is labelled on the app store as being for those aged  and over. But its simple for users to lie about their age.Once logged in with an account, users can then post videos of themselves which are broadcast to other people - any of whom can then message the person directly.Emily Steers and Lauren Kearns, from Northamptonshire, are both  years old. Together, they run a TikTok channel with more than a million followers.Emilys dad Mark said: [Some of the messages] are a bit worrying. When they do catch people saying bad things or sexual things, they [TikTok] should have the power to block them or actually take them away straightaway.Another concerned parent, Nigel Wharton, said: I checked my  year old sons account and found five private messages from adults...one telling him they love him.I reported all of them, took screen shots and deleted the app. Be very careful parents.Meanwhile gran Michaela Clark, , from Derbyshire, was shocked when she learned her granddaughter Grace, ten, had been groomed on the site.She told the Sun Online: She’d been entering private chats with someone who’d claimed to have known her.He threatened to come to her house and take hershe didnt do certain things.“It just makes you want to scream out to people. What appears to be an innocent site where she’s making music videos and sending them to her friends is a site with nasty people on.Graces mum Jemma was horried. It’s really, really sad. It needs highlighting to everyone out there.TikTok, which is run by a seven-year-old company in Beijing called ByteDance, allows people to create short, snappy videos and share them around the world.Its only been going in its current format for  years, but its already available in more than  countries and has been downloaded more than  million times in the last year.A month after it launched, it surpassed Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and SnapChat in monthly installs.TikTok user Liz W, , who goes by the name @bitheoji on the app, explained how the app plays into the hands of predators.She said: If some creepy guy just keeps liking videos of younger girls doing similar audios or soundtracks or hashtags, those are going to keep coming up on his For You page.So its easier for him to find more victims. And I think thats what makes it so easy for predators to come on it and victimise young children.The French vlogger Le Roi des Rats said predators do not hide at all.He said: When a young girl dances in skimpy clothes or imitates sexy dances, you’re sure to find people in the comments either asking them to continue making these kinds of videos, saying they’re sexy or asking for their Snapchat or DM [to direct message]. Some of these girls are not even ten years old.Campaigners have also warned of the risks of young people falling prey to paedophiles on the app.Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, told the Sun Online: Serious questions need to be asked about TikToks moderation practicesusers are able to freely post sexually suggestive comments to children.This is exactly the sort of content which needs to be targeted and removed but clearly that is not happening.Social media self-regulation has demonstrably failed and its time for the new Government to urgently bring in laws that force s to have a legal duty to keep children safe.Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardos, said: Without the right security settings, children broadcasting live video of themselves in their bedrooms over the internet could be targeted by abusers.John Carr, one of the UKs leading experts on child online safety, warned: Theres no question an app like this is a magnet for paedophiles.Last month -year-old girl Lakerika McNeal, from Memphis, Tennessee, went missing after leaving her house to meet with a man she met on TikTok.Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported that ISIS militants were posting twisted jihadi propaganda on the site.The now-removed videos featured corpses being paraded through streets, IS singalongs and fighters posing with guns, all aimed at enlisting impressionable youngsters.In response, the app said safety was its top priority.A spokesman told the Sun Online: We have investigated the comments and swtly removed those that violated our community guidelines.We deploy a combination of policies, technologies and moderation strategies to detect and review problematic content and comments and implement appropriate penalties.We have also introduced a range of measures to better safeguard our users, including: comment filtering to allow users to choose and automatically hide certain words from appearing in their comments prompting users under  to make their account private at set-up and enabling users to make their account private at any time.We also encourage users to report any inappropriate content they see on the  using our reporting .While these protections wont catch all instances of misuse, were committed to improving and enhancing our protective measures and using learnings like these to continuously hone our moderation efforts.Can I prevent my teen from downloading TikTok TikTok have given the app a + store rating which allows parents to use device-based parental controls to block apps from an underage child’s phone.Please see the Apple App Store or Google Play Store instructions for more on parental controls and how to enable them.How can my teen control who sees their videos and sends them messages Users can control who can see their uploaded content, follow them, and send them messages by making their account private.

Harry remained in England alone without his we to finalise the deal.The terms of the couple’s new le will come into effect within months after a transition period.They are expected to attend royal events in the UK before the deal formally begins.They will also keep their charities and patronages and roles as president and vice president of The Queen’s Commonwealth Trust.Harry and Meghan will remain Duke and Duchess and members of the Royal Family but will not use HRH titles in any new jobs.Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are grateful to Her Majesty and the Royal Family for their ongoing support as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.“As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments.“They will no longer receive public funds for royal duties.“With the Queen’s blessing, the Sussexes will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations.

The monarchy expert said the bombshell deal is “cataclysmic” and the Queen has “brought down the iron fist” to end the crisis.He said: “This is an abdication. We now know it will be Harry and Meghan, there will be no more Royal Highness, no more representing the Queen on great occasions, no more being part of the royal and ceremonial Royal Family, no more military involvement and no more public money.“This is an abdication in a sense from the Royal Family for Harry and he and his we are now free to a certain extent to go and follow the dreams that they have.“It’s still very warm on the pastoral side of affection from a grandmother to her grandson and her great-grandson and granddaughter-in-law, but at the same time she has brought down the iron fist of monarchical leadership on a problem that needed to be solved.“She has made it very clear that the royal status, the princely status, should be dissolved.“But no longer part of the royal business no longer carrying that benefit from the public funds of doing out Frogmore Cottage.“This is an ex prince who is laying down all those royal trappings and those for his we and it seems for his son.”He also said that the situation with Harry and Meghan was turning into an “enormous distraction” and that there will be no “halfway house” for the pair.TV host Piers Morgan tweeted: “The Queen has told Meghan and Harry to sling their part-time royal hook. Well done, Your Majesty right decision. Only surprised it took her so long to get Harry to ditch his family, the monarchy, the military and his country. What a piece of work.“Bottom line: Meghan and Harry wanted to have their cake  eat it, but the Queen just took the cake back to the royal kitchens.”Lord West, former head of the Navy, said he was disappointed Harry is stepping back from military appointments.He said: “The whole situation is extremely sad. It is unfortunate, after his splendid service that he will now no longer be involved with the military in the UK.” And James Glancy, an ex-captain in the Royal Marines, said he and others would not raise a toast to their ceremonial headhe tried to cash in on his royal position with commercial ventures.Sky royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills said: “The Sussexes can now start what they wanted which is this independent le.“There are still many details to be worked through but certainly this is beginning to give us a little more clarity.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems like such a waste for them to walk away.This week, Harry launched his Invictus Games with suitably stirring music and a passionate voiceover that showed how much he cares about this terric project, which helps wounded servicemen and women from all over the world.It is such a positive and effective way to give these heroes real purpose. Harry has been the driving force since it was little more than an idea on the back of a fag packet.The next day she made a low-key visit to young girls campaigning to combat climate change.Meghan was relaxed, caring and didn’t look for special treatment.Her visits were without pomp and fuss. You can tell it meant the world to everyone she encountered.She could easily have stayed in her mansion on Vancouver Island, closed the curtains and spent her days being pampered.Instead, she got up off her bottom and tried to do a bit of good for causes she cares about.It is admirable — but would the world have been as interestedthey were just plain old Harry and Meghan, without the aura of royalty And will the world’s Press still give such deserving causes the same level of attention this time next yearHarry and Meghan are no longer members of the Firm I’m not so sure. That’s why I would love them to slam on the brakes and reconsider their position.They can always rehire the staff axed from Frogmore House, especially as a move to Canada as “quasi royals” doesn’t look as welcoming as they first thought.Bedazzled PM Justin Trudeau at first promised that the famed Mounties would provide security and protection, but he has had to embarrassingly roll back on his offer and, while the extremely polite Canadians are happy to have Harry and Meghan as guests, they aren’t so keen on footing the bill to have them there permanently.The Queen would be thrilled to have her grandson back and the chance to get to know her great-grandson Archie properly.She would want to buy him his first pony and watch him learn to ride. He could grow up with his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and be a proper part of the family.There are obviously tensions, hurt feelings and resentments within this clan. But surely the terribly British passive-aggressive arguments and niggles could be ironed out.It can’t really be too late to wipe the slate clean and start afresh.The first thing to be done is for Harry and Meghan to drop that daft court case against a British newspaper which printed a letter she had written to her dad, after he ­voluntarily handed it over.No one is going to come out of that fight with any dignity, and we don’t want to see Thomas Markle forced to give evidence against his daughter in court. They should concentrate their energies instead on trying to salvage their relationship, though I fear that ship has sailed.And brothers William and Harry need to go for a beer and sort out their gripes.Harry also needs to get back in touch with his old pals, who have been fiercely loyal and deeply hurt at being airbrushed out of his le.Surely an agreement can be hammered out which sees Harry and Meghan able to pursue their own causes without being stled by the Palace hierarchy, but also with everyone singing from the same song sheet and not constantly upstaging each other.I know the Queen wants Harry and Meghan’s new roles to be cut and dried as quickly as possible, with minimum fuss. But maybe what is needed is a bit of breathing space. Harry is due to go back to Canada in a couple of days to be reunited with Meghan and their young son.It might be a forlorn hope, but I would dearly like to see them having a rethink about their future and come back in from the Canadian cold.It would be a shamepride and stubbornness on both sides stopped them as I believe they would still get a warm welcome from the vast majority of us. It’s not too late.CAN we all just take a minute to salute the absolute force of nature that is Sun Online columnist and BBC presenter Deborah James Deborah has just been declared cancer-free – three years after a diagnosis of incurable bowel cancer and being given an EIGHT per cent chance of survival.Deborah is a walking miracle who has rewritten the textbooks and is giving hope to others living with the disease.She is also one of the kindest, sunniest, most decent women I know.She co-hosts the unmissable podcast You, Me And The Big C and is a regular on my TV show, where her funny, honest appearances have saved lives.Deborah takes every chance to spell out the symptoms of bowel cancer and encourage people not to be embarrassed about seeing a doctorthey notice any changes in their bowel movements.She has even laughingly nicknamed herself “Bowel Babe” to sht the silly stigma Brits feel about bums.As a result, people have had cancer detected early enough to get effective treatment, extending their lives.Sadly, Deborah’s heady news does not mean she is cured.This disease can rear its ugly head again, as Deborah knows all too well.But I hope she spends this weekend celebrating with friends, family and a large glass of wine, or by buying herself a sassy outfit and handbag.She’s a true inspiration. I’m proud to know her.She lost st after realising she was too heavy and wanted to be healthier for her son.Being overweight subjects you to all kinds of health problems. It is not about fat-shaming.You need to be sensible and take care of yourself.Adele has grafted to provide for her child and now has literally worked her ar*e off to make sure she is around for as long as possible. Good on her.THE new James Bond film is still a long way off, but speculation about who will succeed pouty Daniel Craig as  is reaching fever pitch.It seems that any cute actor to ever wear a tuxedo could be up for the part. My favourites for the role include Britain’s most handsome man Idris Elba, right – obviously – as well as Scotsman Richard Madden and the delectable Andrew Scott.Andrew was a villain in Bond’s previous big-screen outing, ’s Spectre, but let’s not hold that against him.If EastEnders’ Ben Mitchell can have SIX dferent heads over the years, we can surely ignore the slight inconvenience of Andrew’s scheming tech-terrorist trying to bump off all of MI.James Norton is another contender, but I have taken issue with him since catching up with The Trial Of Christine Keeler on BBC.It’s a slightly schlocky take on the infamous Sixties scandal involving the Tory cabinet minister John Profumo, who had a sexual relationship with Christine when she was just  – at the same time that she was “romantically linked” with Russian spy Yevgeny Ivanov.James plays society osteopath Stephen Ward, who acted as a sort of posh pimp and introduced Christine to Profumo in the first place. He is super-creepy in the series, with an intensely irritating habit of calling Christine “little baby” in almost every sentence.If you watch the show and sink a drink every time he utters those annoying words, you will be sloshed about ten minutes into each episode.It has taken the shine off Mr Norton for me, so I’m afraid he has to go to the back of the Bond queue.I AM convinced that when The Masked Singer’s Octopus character takes off its head, it will be revealed as model actress singer Caprice.I have absolutely no insider knowledge and only say this because Caprice actually released a single in the late Nineties.While doing the promotion rounds, on GMTV she very gamely warbled her song on a freezing beach while wearing not very much – in one of that show’s many fabulously surreal segments.If Caprice could cope with all that, then dressing up as a giant, eight-tentacled creature that can squirt black ink from its bottom would be a breeze.HUGH GRANT, who was absolutely brilliant in Paddington , is entitled to his opinion, like everyone . But I take real issue with him perpetuating the myth that tragic Princess Diana was “effectively killed” by British tabloid newspapers.Diana died in an accident because she was being driven by a drunk and didn’t have her seatbelt fastened. She had been stripped of her HRH title, which meant she didn’t have proper security, while the car was being driven too fast in a bid to elude bottom-feeding French paparazzi.To say the British Press were purely to blame is outrageous. And as Hugh Grant’s accusation went unchallenged during his appearance on US TV, most Americans will take it as gospel.They tend to believe posh actors who speak with cut-glass, upper-class accents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They had tothey wanted any viewers at all.Without Auntie, I reckoned that naked commercialism would take over and, soon, we’d end up with television like they had in Italy or Spain.Hours of incomprehensible game shows followed by a shouty weathergirl in not much of a bikini.But then along came Volvo sponsors Sky Atlantic with a host of dramas in which a Swedish detective in a jumper would solve crimes by staring into a lake for six weeks. We loved them.And then there was Amazon and Netflix, who realised thatwe were going to give them our money, they’d better bloody well give us some brilliant, intelligent shows in . So they did.All of this meant thatwe had the cash, we could get home after work and watch Breaking Bad or Ray Donovan or Dexter, or The Man In The High Castle or The Last Ship, or Ozark, or a Swedish woman staring into another lake, or Game Of Thrones, or The Sopranos or The Wire or  or ­Billions, or True Detective.Or we could watch a skateboarding duck on The One Show.Then there’s football. Right now,you’re a fan, you must pay BT, Sky and Amazon to stay in touch.That’s expensive, especially as you are also forced to pay your licence fee for a service that offers almost no live football at all. Or decent sport of any kind.To fight back against the onslaught of choice, the BBC has announced that by  . . . ready . . . drum roll . . . two-thirds of its staff will be based outside London.So what  Sure, you can have a technology hub in Newcastle and locate your Sounds app in Salford butall the decisions are still being made in Islington, over a plate of nuclear-free, vegetarian peace kale, it won’t make any dference.The fact is that the BBC is effectively governed by the monoculture that is social media. It’s ­terried of offending Twitter, so it abides by the rules.Far-right politics are bad. Far-left politics are fine. Veganism is good. Donald Trump is not.You get the impression thatthe BBC made The Crown, the Queen would be played by that guy in a wheelchair from Countryfile and Prince Philip by Idris Elba.And all they’d ever talk about, because all anyone ever talks about on any BBC show, is bloody climate change.I know it’s very noble but after a while, it becomes wearing. And I find myself sitting there ­thinking: “Oh for God’s sake, can’t they just have sex ”No. Obviously, no one can have sex on the BBC because a baby might result. And babies need food which, of course, causes global warming.The BBC was set up to “inform, educate and entertain”. Not “lecture, bombard and lecture again”.It’s got to the point now where the only BBC programmes I regularly watch are Pointless and Match Of The Day.I can’t even bring myself to listen to Attenborough any more. In the past, it was: “Look at this amazing fish which can breathe through its anus.”Now, it is: “Look at this amazing fish that can breathe through its anus and which is threatened by climate change.”Soon, it’s entirely possible the licence fee will become voluntary and when it does, the BBC will quickly learn that to ­survive it must make shows people want to watch.That’s people everywhere, not just ­Twitter people in a Shoreditch juice bar.Killing Eve. Fleabag. Earth’s Tropical Islands. More of that.And less of everything .So it’s good to see Meghan’s still working hard on behalf of those with mental-health issues.I’LL be honest. When it seemed likely that Mr Corbyn would win the General Election, I briefly entertained the idea of emigrating.I figured that there’d be no point living in the UKthe Government was going to take all my earnings and savings in tax.I even went so far as to go online and look at properties for sale in Italy. They all looked lovely – old stone farmhouses with pools – and all for less than a one-bedroom flat in Harpenden.But then I started to think: “Hang on. I don’t have any friends or family in Italy, so in about two hours I’d be lonely.”Then, the next day I’d drown my loneliness with a lunchtime drink, and then another.I’d make a rule that there’d be no drinking before , but soon I’d make that am.And within a month, I’d be pouring red wine on my cornflakes. Within a year, I’d be in a hospital trying to say, in Italian, to a doctor: “Please can I have a new liver ”I’m telling you all this because Harry and Meghan probably think le will be peachy by the sea in Canada.But home is where your friends are.And Harry’s friends, at least, are in the UK. He’s going to miss them. A lot. I guarantee it.WE have learned from American news footage that when there’s a small flood or some wind, we must go on the news and wail like stuck pigs about the injustice of it all.It makes me so angry that even my hair starts to itch.So I was delighted this week to see that when some floods came to the area where Jodie Kidd lives, she simply rolled up her trousers and carried on as normal.It does help, mind you, that she’s taller than The Shard.FOR reasons known only to a lunatic, it would cost £, to ring the bell in Big Ben to celebrate our departure from the EU.Hmmm. Seeing as the tower is currently hidden behind a million tons of scaffolding, why doesn’t someone go up there with a CD player and some big speakers We’d never know.THERE was further proof this week that the stock market is mad and everyone involved with it is Wolf Of Wall Street bonkers.Because apparently, City types now give Tesla a higher valuation than Ford and General Motors combined.Even though the electric minnow takes three months to produce what the big boys produce in a week.And is run by a dope enthusiast who calls random strangers “pedos” on social media.

Not only is Brexit now sailing through Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly is back up and running after years in abeyance.Number  is now keen to get on with delivery.Ministers and advisers have been personally reminded that running their departments is far more important than appearing on television or ­talking to the media.Boris wants to restore the kind of Cabinet discipline we haven’t seen since the early Blair years. But moving forward also offers a chance to BRING THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER.As Boris’s great hero Winston Churchill used to say: “In ­victory, magnanimity.”At Prime Minister’s Questions this week, he took a much less confrontational style than usual.With everyone apart from the Labour and Scottish National Party leaders, he went out of his way to be generous and not score party-political points.Given that Boris likes to be liked, this is a more natural approach for him than being confrontational with every opposition MP.Boris wants to occupy the common ground. His approach to Brexit night on January  reflects that.Rather than being out with Nigel Farage and Co in Parliament Square, he will address the nation on this momentous moment from Downing Street.I am told the message will be upbeat but he will also try to reach out and reassure those who voted Remain. It would be tempting for Boris to join in some full New Year’s Eve-style celebration. And there are undoubtedly Leave voters who would love him to do just that.The danger is that this might alienate those who voted Remain but who have now reconciled themselves to the result and want to help the country pull together.What is key is that in the coming weeks, the Government shows it knows what it wants to do to improve voters’ lives. Boris must put meat on the bones of his plan to “level-up” infrastructure and opportunity across the country.He must show he knows not only how to keep the ­economy growing but how to get it out of second gear, which it has been stuck in — along with most of the West — since the financial crisis of .The next few months present a remarkable opportunity for the PM. He has a sizeable ­parliamentary majority and a united government, while both Labour and the Lib Dems are absorbed by their own leadership contests.This is his moment to really crack on.THIS week, the European Union Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said it is “just not possible” to conclude everything on the UK’s future relationship with the EU by the December  deadline for the end of the transition period.But the UK and the EU both agreed to that timeframe in the political declaration.The EU shouldn’t have signed up to itthey didn’t think it was possible to agree things by that date.Boris Johnson is determined not to extend this transition period.He feels the whole process has gone on too long already. So there needs to be some compromise to keep things moving.What is key is that at the end of this year the UK is no longer sending millions to the EU every day the UK determines its own immigration policy and the role of the European Court of Justice in the UK ends on all matters other than the rights of EU citizens.THE Royal Family is in its worst crisis since the death of Diana.By contrast, Boris Johnson is determined to stay out of the current drama.BORIS JOHNSON’S refusal of Nicola ­Sturgeon’s demands for a second Scottish independence ­referendum was definitive.But it will become very hard to ­continue to refuse those callsthe SNP wins a majority at next year’s Scottish Parliament elections, in a campaign dominated by the ­question of whether or not there should be a second referendum.On a list of things that could derail this Government, Scotland is very high up the list.The best way to stop that happening is for the Tories, along with the other unionist parties, to deny the SNP an absolute majority at Holyrood in .That will require the Government to pay more attention to ­Scotland and be more prepared to call out the SNP on its ­domestic policy failures.THE first public hustings of the Labour leadership contest take place today – and the race looks set to be hard fought.A survey this week putting Shadow ­Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey ­narrowly ahead has dented the idea that Shadow Brexit ­Secretary Keir Starmer has it in the bag. It doesn’t look like the contest is going to be a particularly comradely affair.The personal jabs are already coming and the election isn’t over until April. Starmer and Long Bailey are the two front- runners. The Tories believe both candidates provide them with opportunities.Long Bailey wants to continue the Corbyn project. She will not bring Labour back towards the mainstream of British politics. Starmer, though, is the architect of the parliamentary manoeuvring on Brexit and the second ­referendum policy that hurt Labour so badly in those Red Wall constituencies lost in the election.As one Tory grandee puts it: “If they go for Keir, they’re locking in a problem with those Leave-voting seats.”The dark horse is Lisa Nandy. She performed best in the hustings for Labour MPs, put in a far better performance with interviewer Andrew Neil than Jeremy Corbyn did and is picking up some interesting endorsements.The longer this contest goes on, the better she will do. But even Nandy is making missteps and ­providing the Tories with ammunition in the event she becomes leader.This week, she defended free movement. She claimed voters in towns of the North and Midlands weren’t really opposed to it.This flies in the face of the fact that so many of these places voted Leave in , then flipped to the Tories in last month’s “Brexit election”.Nandy won’t pay an immediate price for this misstep, as most Labour members are pro-free movement themselves.But her decision to speak out shows how focused the contest is on Labour’s “selectorate” and not the broader electorate.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dire warnings from British industries after Chancellor Sajid Javid admitted businesses will be hit, exposes why the Prime Minister focuses on the trivial. Projecting a clock face on Downing Street at pm on January  after Johnson’s “bung a bob” campaign collapsed neatly illustrates the illusion of Brexit. There is no £m NHS pot of gold at the end of the Brexit rainbow but redundancies are feared in cars and pharmaceuticals alongside increased shopping costs. History is written by victors and  will see political opponents fighting to stop Johnson triumphantly claiming he got Brexit done in  days time when treacherous trade talks lie ahead. Labour and other parties face an uphill, tricky battle when many Brexit voters won’t want economic and security damage inflicted by quitting Europe pinned on disrupting relations with  neighbours. When trust is a major issue in politics it is breathtaking a cynical liar was given an -seat parliamentary majority. Unpopular Jeremy Corbyn and a confused Labour campaign are partly to blame yet Johnson lives on  years of kid-glove treatment as a TV celebrity politician, infantilised as cosy “Boris” to gt him repeated Get Out of Jail Free cards. This is the year a charlatan PM fears he’ll begin to be held to account, Labour Governments and the David Cameron-Theresa May Tory eras fading in the rear view mirror. The economy, health, education, crime and Brexit are problems he must be forced to own.

We must reboot and renew Britain or we risk losing it. “An outdated institution  miles or so north of its current location is still an outdated institution.” Mr Brown will call for a UK-wide constitutional convention and regional citizens’ assemblies to gauge public opinion.He will suggest setting up a Forum of the Nations and Regions to prevent a centralisation of power in London after Brexit . This could then form the basis for a new second chamber that would ultimately replace the House of Lords. The Labour heavyweight also wants the Treasury to hand over powers over allocation of regional spending to local authorities, mayors and MPs sitting on a “Northern Exchequer” board.  “On vital issues, outlying regions and communities will no longer be governed simply by dictates from London second guessing what they want,” he will say.   “The demand for more power to the North is far greater than can be met by gimmicks or gestures given that the UK is a unitary state but a multinational country that it is asymmetric with  per cent of the votes at elections in England and that political, financial and administrative power has been over-concentrated in one city in the South.” The speech at a Hope Not Hate event in Westminster comes after it emerged Mr Johnson was considering moving  peers permanently to York in a major sht of British political gravity. Under the plans, the House of Commons would also go on tour - holding debates in cities outside of London.  York, sometimes referred to as “the capital of the North”, is reportedly the preferred option but Birmingham is also in the running. The exact location would be decided by a constitutional review, announced in the Tory manesto and launched in the Spring, which would also look at the powers and role of the Supreme Court and Lord Chancellor. Tory party chairman James Cleverly confirmed the government was considering moving the House of Lords to a Northern city. Disused government-owned land close to York railway station has already been identied as a potential site.  He told Sky’s Sophy Ridge programme: “What we are looking at is a whole range of options about making sure every part of the UK feels properly connected from politics.  “When the PM stood up the day after the election and said this is going to be the people’s government he meant it. That meant connecting people with government and politics.” "},{"url":null,"title":"archies mystery godparents unmasked meghan","story":"NewsArchies mystery godparents unmasked as Meghan and Harry plan new leTiggy Petter, Harry and Williams former nanny, and Mark Dyer, their mentor and friend, join Harrys friend Charlie van Straubenzee as the only known godparents of Archie so farShareCommentsByChiara Fiorillo:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video mark-dyer-attends-harry-meghans-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news archies-mystery-godparents-unmasked-meghan-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Of the girls questioned, % had spotted dferences in the way females were treated in the media, while % noticed a dference at school and % said there were dferences at home, the State of Girlsapos Rights in the UK  report found. Among the issues raised were feeling unsafe in public, hampered by stereotypical subject choices and sexual harassment in the classroom, believing that their opinions are not heard and an anxiety-inducing pressure to look a certain way. Plan International UKaposs chief executive Rose Caldwell described it as extremely saddening but not surprising that girls still feel disempowered, while the NSPCC said far too many girls are being harassed and work needs to start in primary schools to help society protect them from abuse. Blackpool was named as the toughest place to be a girl in the UK based on a range of le quality factors including child poverty, le expectancy and those were were not in education, employment or training. Liverpool, Nottingham and Kingston Upon Hull were also among the  lowest performing local authorities. Orkney Islands, East Renfrewshire, Wokingham and Kingston-upon-Thames were among the top  performing local authorities for a girl to live in. According to the poll, % of girls said they had seen photos of themselves which made them feel bad about their looks. It took, on average,  photo attempts before young girls are happy to post a photo on social media. The researchers noted: From the images they see in the media to harmful comments at school, girls are feeling pressured to conform to unrealistic beauty and body standards. This is exacerbated by the exponential number of images girls are exposed to today - both online and offline. Being severely affected by continual street harassment was a problem for many of the girls living in both urban and rural areas, according to the study. Girls said they did not feel safe on their own as they made their way through the places they live and, and many tried to find ways to avoid being physically and verbally harassed. The study found that stereotypical subject choices in schools are holding girls back from careers where women are under-represented. The girls experienced a shockingly high rate of sexual harassment, including rude images sent to their mobile telephones, from other pupils. Girls also felt singled out and most likely to be affected by school policies on things like strict unorm rules or not being able to use the toilet during classes. The girls said they did not get enough support in dealing with these issues. Despite the rise of young female campaigners such as climate activist Greta Thunberg and Amika George, whose work focuses on period poverty, many girls said they were not being listened to.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan won their freedom from the Royal Family last night – but at a heavy price. In a deal which effectively sees them out in the cold they will not use their HRH titles, will no longer formally represent the Queen and will not receive public funds for royal duties.Buckingham Palace said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex intend to repay £.million used to do up Frogmore Cottage – the Windsor home they will continue to use when in the UK.But they will spend the majority of their time in North America – which means chilly Canadian winters – after deciding to step back as senior royals. In a signicant move Harry will also relinquish any military duties. The new arrangements take effect from the spring – putting paid to the couple’s proposal last week that they could continue as part-time royals and perform overseas tours. Effectively the Queen – after discussions with Prince Charles, Harry and his brother William – made it clear there was no halfway house. They were either in or out – and last night’s statements show they are out. The Queen said in an emotional statement: “Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family. “Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved members of my family. I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over two years and support their wish for a more independent le. “I want to thank them for all their dedicated work and am particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family. It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new le.” The -year-old monarch ordered an agreement to be reached with the couple in just  days. The key details of the deal were contained in a Palace statement. It said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are grateful to Her Majesty and the Royal Family for their ongoing support as they embark on the next chapter of their lives. “They understand they are required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments. They will no longer receive public funds for royal duties. “With The Queen’s blessing, the Sussexes will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty. “The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared their wish to repay Sovereign Grant expenditure for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home. “This new model will take effect in the spring of .” However, in a sign that the royals want to keep the couple close and monitor their activities, royal aides confirmed all agreements will be reviewed in a year’s time. Officially, they retain the HRH title – which was removed from Princess Diana after her orce from Charles.  The couple are now free to seek new jobs allowing them to strike mega deals in the corporate world. But any private contracts will take months to be agreed over fears their ventures could sully the royal brand. Harry, , was born a prince of Wales and will remain a prince. Prince Charles has assured son Harry and Meghan, , that he will continue to support them financially.It has not been decided whether they will be able to continue with their “Sussex Royal” brand used to cultivate .million Instagram followers.PR gurus say it could be worth £million in the first year alone. A royal insider said last night: “Harry and Meghan have got their wish, but no one can be really sure what the future will hold for them.” Home Office mandarins and their Canadian counterparts are finalising terms to pay for the family’s security arrangements after more controversy over who would meet the payments.  A Palace spokesman said: “There are well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security.” Harry will also give up his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, which is likely to cause great concern in the charity sector. A royal insider said: “This represents a quite simply staggering turn of events. After less than two years of marriage, when the public held them in such high regard, Harry and Meghan have quit. The Queen, along with Prince Charles and Prince William acted decisively so there would be no grey area, they could not have their cake and eat it, to be part-time royals, so they had no choice but to step back completely. “This is without a doubt one of the most remarkable turn of events in modern royal history.” The couple suggest they will continue to represent their patronages of British organisations and charities, of which Harry has  and Meghan four. Harry is expected to rejoin Meghan and son Archie on Vancouver Island, Canada, in the coming days. Meghan fled there just  hours after the couple released their bombshell statement saying they wanted to step back as senior royals and become financially independent. The couple’s plans, announced after a six-week break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the royals by surprise and reportedly left the Queen and other members of the family hurt and disappointed.

Prince Harry and Meghan married in May  and it was assumed the couple would call the UK home. The Queen gted the couple Frogmore Cottage in Windsor as their marital home, with a refurbishment to the property costing the UK taxpayer £. million. However, it now appears Meghan may never have fully committed to living in Britain full-time. It has now emerged that when the Duchess of Sussex left her home in Toronto where she had lived for seven years previously and where legal drama Suits was filmed, she left behind an entire wardrobe filled with her clothes. The shocking revelation suggests the former actress had always intended to spend a great deal of time in Canada, even before the couple announced their intention to step back earlier this month. Canada’s Entertainment Tonight TV channel reported that when Meghan moved to London in November  to live with Prince Harry, initially at Kensington Palace’s Nottingham Cottage, she packed up her clothes and put them into storage in Toronto for use at a later date. A signicant proportion of the clothes are thought to have been left behind and have now been shipped to the home they have rented on Vancouver Island. Some of the clothes Meghan left in Canada have been worn since herover the Christmas period, including a black cashmere beanie, a parka by Soia  Kyo, a Barbour “Epler” coat and the “Bea” cable knit sweater from The Row.  ET Canada’s online editor Jamie Samhan wrote: “While it was known the Duchess put her furniture into storage, it was said at the time she took all her personal items with her. “It also begs the question, did Meghan always plan on ing to North America in some capacity  Many have raised doubts around the step down of being senior royals and that both Prince Harry and Meghan had been planning this for some time. “The two did give the full royal le a go, but perhaps they always considered having a Canadian abode.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle every girls dream","story":"NewsMeghan Markle has had every girls dream and tossed it away says dad ThomasThe estranged -year-old father spoke about his relationship with his daughter Meghan in a TV documentary.

The estranged -year-old father spoke about his relationship with Meghan and their fallout in a -minute TV documentary, Thomas Markle: My Story. His comments were made public after it was revealed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer be using their HRH titles and receiving public funds for royal duties. Speaking to Channel , Mr Markle said: When they got married they took on an obligation, and the obligation is to be part of the Royals and to represent the Royals. And it would be foolish for them not to. This is one of the greatest, long-living institutions ever. They are destroying it, they are cheapening it, making it shabby.

Buckingham Palace said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex intend to repay £.million while they seek to become financially independent. The Queen said in an emotional statement: “Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family. “Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved members of my family. I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over two years and support their wish for a more independent le.  “I want to thank them for all their dedicated work and am particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family. It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new le.” Buckingham Palace outlined the key details of the deal in a statement: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are grateful to Her Majesty and the Royal Family for their ongoing support as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.  “They understand they are required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments. They will no longer receive public funds for royal duties. “With The Queen’s blessing, the Sussexes will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.

For seven years Sue Bramley remained unaware of her home’s dark past and was baffled as all her bedding plants, lawn seed and turf died.

Then police searching for previous owners Patricia and William Wycherley, both missing, arrived to dig up the slabs. And they unearthed the couple’s corpses in a ft-deep grave.

As the deal about the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs future is thrashed out between the couple, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, part of the deal will include the loss of his official military appointments. These official military appointments include Captain General of Marines, Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Honington, and Commodore-in-Chief of Small Ships and Diving. He and the Duchess of Sussex will also lose their appointments as Commonwealth Youth Ambassadors.From Spring, Harry and Meghan Markle will no longer be working members of the Royal Family, officially represent the Queen or use their HRH status.

No longer senior royals, the couple have been granted their wish to turn their backs on Britain setting up their initial home in Canada. But behind Meghan’s kilowatt smile, the broad grins the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have recently lit up Vancouver Island with during their seven-week stay, belie the harsh reality Harry now faces. For according to the magazine Meghanaposs friends speak to, the Prince arrives in Canada “cut off” from many of the close pals he once cherished. People magazine claim about six months into Meghan‘s pregnancy with son Archie, the Prince left his circle of pals behind seeing him increasingly surrounded by his we’s friends.Most no longer even have his cell number,” a source told the respected magazine.  “They totally understand that men often drt from their friends after marriage, but there’s still a lot of resentment because they had been so close for so long.” Now following Saturday’s announcement by the Queen, the Prince is due to arrive back on Vancouver Island this week to be reunited with his we and son to plan their new futures together. Before Harry and Meghan were the royal couple self-appointed to modernise the monarchy. But after “stepping back” from royal duties, the pair will today begin the arduous task of house hunting across the pond and finding schools Archie will one day attend. This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity, the couple wrote on their website.  On Saturday the Queen revealed that Harry and Meghan’s North American home would be in Canada. “There will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK,” reads the statement. The couple has made no secret of their love for the country. Meghan spoke about both the splendour of Canada and the warmth of its people following the coupleaposs Christmas break on Vancouver Island. “Just to be able to take in the warmth that we experienced from the people but also just to walk around and just see the beauty of Canada,” she said. “To see Archie go ‘ahhh’ when you walk by and just see how stunning it is, so it meant a lot to us.” Exactly where the Sussexes will live in Canada has yet to be announced publicly, but some locations are more likely than others.  Meghan is said to be particularly keen on Toronto, calling the city her “second home” after spending seven years there as she filmed the US legal drama Suits. Yesterday it emerged the Duchess had held clothes into storage in Toronto hinting she may have always held ambitions of ing to Ontario to one day live there again. Toronto has several well-heeled neighbourhoods including Forest Hill and Deer Park, where Meghan’s best friend Jessica Mulroney lives. Butthe couple is prepared to spend a chunk of their £ million fortune, the ultra-exclusive Bridle Path - dubbed Canada’s Beverly Hills - is where Harry and Meghan would rub shoulders with the A-listers they now appear to crave. Rapper Drake, singer Celine Dion and the late singer Prince all owned homes within the celebrity oasis. Toronto is also ideally placed to offer Archie an education steeped in British and royal heritage. The city’s Upper Canada College, a private boys’ school, is modelled on Eton - where Harry was educated. The Prince’s grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, has strong ties with the school being on its board of governors until he retired three years ago.  Boarding school Lakefield College in the province of Ontario is also an option. Harryaposs uncle Prince Andrew spent a year there in . Meghan is also well connected in Toronto previously being a staple of the city’s social elite. Although Harry has no known friends there, the Duchess is extremely close to Mulroney and her TV presenter husband Ben – son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Meghan is also close to Markus Anderson, who rose through the ranks at London’s Soho House hotel and members’ club before being sent by founder Nick Jones to open Toronto’s own venue. It was here he met Meghan and the two became firms friends. It was Anderson, now a close confidant and fixer for the Duchess, who introduced her to rich and powerful friends such as the Clooneys. Meghan once said of Toronto: “It’s really funny because I think as much of a big city as Toronto is, it’s so dferent from LA or New York. Thereno paparazzi, so it’s really easy to just have a normal le.”  Itaposs possible Meghan feels that Toronto could give her family that “space to focus on the next chapter,” as she and Harry put it in their announcement. But despite the lure of the Ontario city, speculation is mounting the couple could choose Canadaaposs Pacic west coast as their base. The Royals have spent the last seven weeks on Vancouver Island which boasts Pearson College as a possible school for Archie. The establishment is one of  schools and colleges around the world in the UWC movement, which was set up to promote the principles of peace and international understanding. Built on the shore, it has an ecological reserve and marina while its values are closely aligned to Harry and Meghan’s. The island would also ensure the couple the peace they value amid a backdrop of breathtaking scenery. Alongside the , sq ft £. million mansions they are currently staying in in North Saanich, they are surrounded by other millionaires and rich retirees who move to the Island for a quiet le. The couple could also move to the Vancouver on the mainland with them reportedly eyeing up a £ million home close to Kitsilano beach. Both Toronto and Vancouver have flourishing TV and film industries, which may well be a draw for Meghanshe wants toto acting or pursue a career as a director, as has been rumoured.  Industry tax breaks have seen both cities double their share of film locations for big-budget US movies and TV shows. But the Vancouver would also provide a perfect base for Meghan as it is only a three-hour plane ride to Los Angeles where she grew up and her mother, Doria Ragland, still lives. There she has assembled an elite Hollywood team she secretly retained throughout her time in the British royal family and who are now poring over a host of multi-million dollar offers. They include agent Nick Collins of The Gersh Agency, whose clients include Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx. He is handling lucrative film, TV and philanthropic offers and opportunities on behalf of the couple from around the world. Meghanaposs Beverly Hills business manager Andrew Meyer is also working behind the scenes planning her next major moves, while Hollywood power lawyer Rick Genow is also heavily involved. The team’s creation fuels rumour the Duchess’s ultimate dream is to move back to Calornia eventually but is claimed to be refusing to do so while Donald Trump is President.Los Angeles would also prove problematic in terms of the couple’s privacy as the city is the paparazzi capital of the world. America though, would place them closer to the Duchess’s business, Frim Fram Inc after she moved the firm to Delaware - a US state used by the super-rich to protect their interests from scrutiny.

The -year-old was seen laughing and joking at the Brook House pub on New Kings Road, Fulham. Harry, wearing a grey polo shirt, is thought to have spent at least three hours eating and drinking with seven of his mates, according to The Sun . Revealing he was there until at least pm, an onlooker praised the Duke of Sussex for acting like any normal bloke. The source told The Sun: He seemed very happy, relaxed. He was sat in the middle of seven guys and they spent a good few hours laughing and joking. He seems like he was just a normal guy enjoying a few beers and a meal with his pals. The Brook House overlooks Eel Brook Common and is not far from Cha. Harry has been previously spotted sipping pints in London pubs, including the Jam Tree and The Cross Keys in Cha.  Last week, Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle announced their intention to step back from their senior roles in the Royal Family and work to become financially independent. They added they intend to split their time between the UK and Canada. This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity, the royal couple said in their official statement.  “We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties.” Meghan, who is currently in Canada without her husband, was spotted driving in a dark SUV and picking up a friend from the Victoria International Airport yesterday afternoon.

She arrived at St Mary the Virgin church in Hillington, Norfolk, to attend a Sunday church service less than  hours after details of the future of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were released Her Majesty was accompanied by Prince Andrew in a public show of support for the embattled Duke of York and she sported a broad smile. The monarch stepped out of her Bentley just after Prince Andrew, who waited for his mother to head inside the chapel before following her. The Queen was wearing a grey and white coat with a matching hat with grey and white flowers. The church is near the royal Sandringham estate, where the Queen resides for much of winter. Prince Andrew is believed to have remained in Sandringham for the past few weeks, thereports.It was a public show of support from the Queen to her second eldest son as he appeared by her side for the first time since his car-crash Newsnight interview.On Christmas Day, the Duke of York was seen walking between Sandringham House and the chapel first with his daughter Princess Eugenie and then with Prince Charles. Andrew was given permission by The Queen to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future following the outcry over his past friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.  The Queenaposs attendance at church this morning follows a statement last night by the monarch explaining what the future of Meghan and Harry will be. Buckingham Palace said the Sussexes will stop using their HRH titles and must repay the £.m spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage in Windsor and that the changes will take effect starting from this spring.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry has given up a large part of his income and the use of his title to forge a new le for him and his we. At .pm this evening statements from Buckingham Palace and The Queen gave details of the deal struck between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Queen. The victorious central point from Harry and Meghanaposs perspective is that they have been granted permission to step back from their royal duties. They have also been given the green light to spend a majority of their time away from the UK, most likely in Canada. In winning these freedoms however, Harry has had to shed large parts of the royal le he has lived for the past  years. A big change is the way the coupleaposs finances will work. While Harry will still have the multi-million pound inheritance he received from his mother Princess Diana, as well as an undisclosed annual sum from the Duchy of Cornwall, his outgoings will increase signicantly. Not only will they be paying back the £.million of Sovereign Grant that was spent to refurbish Frogmore Cottage , the couple will pay commercial rent on the home when they are abroad. As well as relieving himself of a fair chunk of his fortune, Harry will no longer be able to use the His Royal Highness title that has adjourned him since he was a young boy. Although he will remain a Duke, he will be HRH in name only.  Another key dference for Harry are the patronages that he will be keeping. Both he and Meghan will retain their personal patronages of charities, but the Prince will lose his official association to the military organisations he currently represents. From the Spring he will no longer be a patron of the Royal Marines, the Royal Naval Commandaposs Small Ships and Diving nor the Royal Air Force Honington.  The couple will also no longer go on royal tours. Most recently they went together to South Africa, Malawi, Angola and Botswana. Harry will also spend a lot more time away from his core group of friends and his family when he sets up shop in North America.While the changes announced today signal the start of a new chapter for the royal family, the Queen suggested her affections were unlikely to waver. She said: Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family, The Queen wrote in a statement released at .pm on Saturday.

Temperatures in the south of the UK are expected to plummet to -Con Monday morning following a chilly Sunday morning of -.C in Oxfordshire and -.C in North Yorkshire. But the coldest week since early December will see a cloak of grey for many as fog and low cloud trap air pollution due to high pressure and cold air.The Met Office has warned that peopleaposs ears could pop on Monday when Britain experiences the highest atmospheric pressure in decades.The predicted freezing temperatures has sparked a public health warning with the elderly and those with heart and lung problems being advised to stay indoors and heat their homes to C to fight off infections.

The coldest place in the UK was Topclfe in North Yorkshire, where it was a frigid -.C in the early hours of Sunday. It was followed by Benson, Oxfordshire , Katesbridge in Co Down, Northern Irelandand Derrylin in Co Fermanagh . The Met Office said Northern Ireland experienced its coldest night of the winter, while temperatures of -C were felt across London - and the chilly conditions are set to continue this week amid a warning from Public Health England. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkhill said a fog warning had been put in place over sections of the West Midlands and north-west England. In many places, Britons woke up to their cars and gardens covered in frost. Mr Burkhill said: Itaposs been a very frosty start but through the bulk of the day itaposs going to be largely fine and largely sunny. It would still be quite chilly with expected highs of C scattered across parts of England, Mr Burkhill added.  He said that there would be some rain for the Shetland Islands. Rain is also possible near coasts in south-eastern places. Temperatures will peak at about -C across the country.  Meanwhile, the fog warning is in place for parts of England, including Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, and North Wales until pm on Sunday. A mid-range cold weather alert has been issued by Public Health England from pm on Sunday to pm on Tuesday.  The organisation is urging people to prepare for cold weather conditions and look out for those most at risk, especially the elderly. Dr Owen Landeg, principal environmental public health scientist at PHE, said: Below  degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well. Police have urged drivers not to leave their vehicles to defrost after an unattended car was stolen in Hertfordshire.  The vehicle was taken after it was left with its engine running on a driveway in Hemel Hempstead on Saturday morning. It was later found on its roof after crashing nearby Met Office five-day weather forecast Sunday Fog patches in the west could persist all day in a few places. Otherwise, mostly dry with sunny periods after a frosty start. The odd shower near coasts in the south-east, whilst cloudier and windier in the far north.

Last night the Queen took that cake away. She made clear to her grandson and his we that self-banishment for a cushy le in Canada will come at a cost – and now the couple are handing £.million back to the taxpayer for tarting up their ­Frogmore Cottage home. But the most eye-catching change in their circumstances is that they will not be using their HRH titles. This is how it should be. Only those who do the work of Royal Highnesses should be allowed to call themselves such. If they are planning to endorse commercial products to make a few bob that is not a label they can attach to them. The Queen has acted decisively but compassionately, firmly but proportionately. As always, she is to be commended for her good sense. We’re saddened Harry and Meghan felt the need to escape, but the now semi-detached royal couple have learned a lesson ordinary folk face every day.  Decisions have consequences. And there is no such thing as free cake. Give kids hope We can only imagine the agony of parents Nikki and Lee when six-year-old daughter Briena told them she wanted to die. This clearly called for professional intervention to ensure Briena did not carry out the dreadful threat to take her own le. But the response was scandalously lacking. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services said Briena was too young to be at risk. Repeated referrals did not get Briena the help she so desperately needed.  It was only when she made suicide attempts aged , and ended up in AE, that her ­condition was taken seriously. This is unacceptable. Suicide rates in young girls have risen  per cent over six years. Ministers talk a lot about improving care for children with mental health issues. But Briena is living testimony that they are not doing enough about it. Boris a turn-off At first sight it looks asBoris Johnson is doing us all a favour by telling his Cabinet ministers they are not to swan around on TV any longer. But have we got news for you.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness. But the seat, the box and most of all the stories, stopped Jessicarsquos nana from melting."},{"url":null,"title":"bypass-old-craighall-sheriffhall-shuts-two-nights","story":"Maintenance workwill take place on the A eastbound carriageway from Wednesday until Friday next week , betweenpm and ameach night.To allow the workto take place, there will be a full closure of the A eastbound carriageway between Sherfhall and Old Craighall.

She has even suffered from disturbing hallucinations - including seeing her GP \"melt\" in front of her - as a result of side effects from tranquilisers prescribed to calm her.However,Maria wants to continue taking the hemp suppositories she will face a pound a month bill for the  packs she needs.The mother-of-three said: \"Why should I be paying the bill when I didnt cause the problem  This was inflicted on me by the NHS so the NHS should be paying for it.\"Its been recommended by the very specialist they sent me to - that I had to fight to be sent to - and now theyre ignoring his advice.\"The condition has calmed down a lot. My own GP says shes never seen me looking better in the past two years than I do now. Theyre the only thing thats worked. For me, its amazing not to have feeling down there.\"The Herald first revealed Marias story in July last year when she spoke of how PGAD meant simple activities such as driving over a pothole or using an escalator could trigger embarrassing orgasms.The condition and the memory of the initial injury have been so debilitating that Dr Goldmeier also recommended a course of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing , a form of psychotherapy more commonly prescribed to alleviate trauma in people who have suffered abuse or served in warzones.: New fathers shouldnt be made to feel like a waste of space on the maternity wardThere is a two-year waiting list on the NHS, however, so Maria is paying for it privately through her health insurance.The same is not possible for the suppositories, however, as current UK guidelines on medicinal cannabis state that it should only be considered where there is \"clear published evidence of benefit\".Currently, that only applies to rare forms of epilepsy in children and young adults, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis.However, when Marias case was raised with Jeane Freeman in December by her then-MP, Jo Swinson, the Scottish Health Secretary said that exceptions could be made for so-called unlicensed products on a \"named patient basis\" where \"there is a clinical need which cannot be met by a licensed medicine and where established treatment options have been exhausted\".Maria has now written back to Ms Freeman begging for her help \"as a woman\" with the health board after her request to be granted the suppositories on this basis was refused.She wrote: \"I have been prescribed an unending list of medication since December , with insufferable side effects. I do not believe that I should be required to tolerate anything producing such side effects when the condition was not of natural cause, but inflicted upon me by the NHS...it is ludicrous that I should be expected to pay for these in order to live a quasi-normal le.\"If the health board will not supply these, then there is a moral obligation for them to fund me in advance in order that I may purchase them myself.

That is why the survival of kelp forests is so crucial ndash to hit our carbon targets we need to both reduce our emissions and draw down those already out there. Itrsquos also why kelp is as the heart of a growing push towards what is being called the blue economy.Erwes is one of many international and local speakers gathering in Oban on February  for a Scottish Seaweed Industry Association conference titled Kickstarting The Seaweed Economy. He and others will create a conversation over seaweed in a seemingly new language, a lexicon of blue that includes terms like blue economy, blue new deal, blue co-ops, blue carbon and blue biotech.It will be about how Scotland can create jobs in rural communities, manufacture revolutionary products and combat climate change at the same time. In Erwesrsquo view, seaweed is ldquoone of the key elements on Earth ndash we are just approaching the potential of this amazing organism.In Scotland, we have a history with kelp. We have long harvested it and other seaweed for many purposes, burning it to create soda ash, extracting iodine from it, and producing alginates. Though the industry has for many years been dormant, the seaweed harvest and processing once helped sustain communities on the west coast and in the Hebrides and Orkney Islands. And now, in this age of climate emergency, some are looking to it once more as a crop.As he puts it: ldquoWe want to expand the forest so we can have more harvesting. In Scotland, policymakers should consider this. Itrsquos not only the question of the amount of kelp we are going to take, but itrsquos also for the next  years the amount wersquore going to plant and replant.Already, globally, seaweed aquaculture is a huge industry, though % of it is farmed in southeast Asia. Other countries in Europe ndash the Faroes, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland ndash have a growing industry. But, says Lawrie Stove, managing director of AquaMoor which creates innovative structures for seaweed farms, ldquoScotland is one of the last ones to get going, though we have a superb latent capacity for seaweed farming.A recent report into the potential of seaweed farming commissioned by Argyll and Bute Council stated that ldquothe development of a seaweed cultivation industry would provide important economic growth to the Highlands and Islands.ldquoUntil now, the focus here has been on academic research and therersquos a lot of money available for research but little available for stimulating commercial activity, Stove says. ldquoThatrsquos why we need to focus on the blue economy and bringing blue investors in. Therersquos a desire and a want to farm seaweed, an understanding it should be part of Scotlandrsquos blue economy, and itrsquos coming together.Stove describes this type of seaweed farming, with kelp growing from ropes in the sea, as ldquorestorative aquaculture. ldquoTherersquos an ecological enhancement from farming seaweed in the sea ndash therersquos no fertilisers, no chemicals, no freshwater, no detrimental ecological effects.Not only can seaweed provide a carbon sink, there are also other benefits, he says. ldquoIt can absorb nitrates and it can help towards deacidication of the oceans, by the nutrient uptake that it involves, Stove points out. ldquoAnd it can attenuate wave energy and help protect coastal communities.ldquoBenefits also include the ecological enhancement to any body of water, creating an area that is really good for fish, like a nursery ground, and the creation of valuable jobs in coastal communities.Though this model is called aquaculture, it is little like Scotlandrsquos major aquaculture industry, salmon farming. Fiona Houston, founder of Mara Seaweed, which sells seasonings and salt replacements, describes it as ldquomore like ranching.ldquoItrsquos putting some ropes in the sea and the seaweed grows, she says.Houston is a key force in driving the idea that Scotland needs to rapidly grow a ldquoblue economy. Since she started Mara Seaweed, a product now stocked in Tesco, she has been driven by the idea that Scotland could develop a signicant industry around seaweed.ldquoI spotted that consumers were more interested in where food was coming from, says Houston. ldquoI was also aware that in Asia seaweed is eaten on a daily basis. I thought this is crazy. Wersquove got ,km of coastline in Scotland. Wersquove got a resource that is vastly undervalued. Andwe used it in the past and itrsquos got a role in the modern diet, why arenrsquot we doing it To begin with, Houston wasnrsquot thinking about seaweed as an element in the fight against climate change. That came later when she learned that seaweed was more efficient at capturing carbon than the rainforest.ldquoSeaweed is not only good for you and tastes good, itrsquos good for the planet, she says. ldquoThis is not now about just the value of seaweed as a product. Itrsquos the value it has for carbon capture.ldquoTherersquos a need for the growth of aquaculture beyond the commercial growth. If we could get a bluegreen deal going that would be great.The model Houston and others are advocating is small-scale farming by local communities. One of the things she hopes to do is make Scotland part of an international blue-cooperative of sustainable seaweed farmers being developed by Erwes. ldquoItrsquos about how you create sustainable employment in geographically remote areas ndash and for public policymakers that is a really key issue, she says.Professor Michele Stanley has been researching seaweed cultivation at the Scottish Association for Marine Science , which runs two test farms off the west coast of Scotland. Stanley is involved in ongoing research into the environmental impact of farming. ldquoItrsquos how you manage it, she points out. ldquoItrsquos choosing the right site and size of farm ndash and making sure therersquos enough nutrients in the water to support the growth, and that yoursquore then not going to impact on other organisms around.One of the things she has been doing is looking at how seaweed farming might benefit seale in the area. SAMS is working with a Chinese partner that has already shown that when shellfish are grown with seaweed there is a positive impact on them. ldquoOne of the problems is that the pH of the ocean has been increasing because of the CO dissolving, and that destroys the shells of the shellfish, says Stanley. ldquoIf yoursquore growing it with seaweed, it is taking CO out and putting oxygen in.According to Stanley, there is a fascinating range of possibilities around products from seaweed. ldquoThere are seaweeds that have the potential for anti-inflammatory compounds, antimicrobial compounds. Scotland has a long seaweed history which waned and now yoursquove got renewed interest in it. Among the old journals we have at SAMS from the s therersquos a copy from a meeting which was looking at using parts of seaweed for textile production.One promising product being developed using brown kelp in Scotland is a biopackaging material that could provide a biodegradable alternative to plastic on food packaging. It is, says Dr Charles Bavington, a biochemist and founder of Oban-based start-up Oceanium, ldquoa completely compostable, ocean-safe packaging material.Bavington began this journey into seaweed packaging after he came in contact with Oceanium co-founder Karen Scofield Seal, a business woman who had studied sustainability and, he says, ldquogot really excited about the potential of seaweed for solving a lot of climate problems.They now use the ldquowhole plant from which they make packaging material, food products, an anti-inflammatory called fucoidan, and beta-glucan, a nutraceutical used for cardiovascular health, and water, which will be reused in processing.Oceanium uses only sustainably farmed seaweed. ldquoWe donrsquot take wild harvest, because it wouldnrsquot be sustainable for the kind of volumes wersquore going to need, says Bavington. ldquoBut having large-scale sustainably farmed seaweed is something that isnrsquot available in the Western world.Like many of those working in the field, he is keen that the growth of seaweed farming is approached with care for environmental impact. ldquoWe need to be careful, because there can be unintended consequences of anything, and for what wersquore proposing to work, it has to be at large scale. We need to be really careful and check before we go for huge scale that wersquove considered all the unintended consequences of very large-scale seaweed farming and processing.But some warn that when it comes to kelp, farming it is not where are priorities should be. David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, says: ldquoIrsquod be deeply cautious about seaweed lsquofarmingrsquo to tackle climate change ndash we know we have huge so-called lsquoblue carbonrsquo stocks in the seaweed and sediments around Scotland, but these are also vital ecosystems that provide a habitat for myriad species and help to buffer us from the worst impacts of storm surges and rising sea levels.ldquoYes, we need to improve our understanding of these marine systems and the ways in which they gain and lose carbon, but at this stage it should be more about better protecting these precious ecosystems rather than trying to farm them.There is a balance to be struck. Seaweed is Scotlandrsquos forgotten treasure. What counts most that it remains, or even expands as a ldquoblue carbon sink. Kelp clearly matters."},{"url":null,"title":"horny-hero-numbers-game-dame-helen-mirren-won-instagram","story":"Im well aware that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting dferent results.

Or in laymans terms: hes a player.Diego quickly drove the opposite sex wild, gaining international Lothario status on a par with Warren Beatty, Julio Iglesias and Coronation Streets Bill Roache.Genetic testing has since revealed that Diego fathered an estimated  offspring, about  per cent of those living on Espanola.

I understand that is what has happened in this case.:Hey Girlsrsquo phenomenal success sees it close in on aim of ending period povertyldquoThe fact of the matter is that that since people like myself, Women for Independence and Ms Lennon have been calling for action to address period poverty, the government have made great efforts to work with the third sector to provide period products to anyone who needs them. I see that in action in my constituency.ldquoThis work, coupled with free provision in schools, colleges and universities, as well as many public buildings having free access has largely addressed the issue, so the need for legislation may not be as pressing as we once thought it was.Martins SNP colleague, campaigner Julie Hepburn, said she was still in support of free period product provision, and added: \" It is fundamentally about dignity and human rights.\"We have made some really good progress, but we still have more work to do. We know that the outcome we all want is the same, but we do need to figure out how to get there, and make sure we have a scheme that is going to be the best value for everyone,\"Labour MSP Lennon said it would be disappointing should opposition politicians choose to withdraw support for the bill, which is currently at stage one in the parliamentary process.She added: \"Across the UK and many other corners of the world, governments and citizens are understanding that access to period products should be a right, not a luxury. We are seeing legal and policy initiatives developing that are making period products more accessible and this will help tackle period poverty and allow period dignity for all.\"Pupils at primary and secondary schools in England are the latest beneficiary of this and itrsquos a real step change to hear a Tory Minister talk about period equality.\"Thatrsquos why it would be incredibly disappointingSNP and Tory MSPs in Scotland take the unambiguous and conservative decision to block the Period Products Bill at Stage . If the clear general principles of the Bill are rejected, we will be telling the rest of the world we donrsquot believe that everyone who needs them should have the right to access free period products.\"The widespread support from organisations and iniduals across Scotland and beyond has convinced me this Bill is necessary and is the right thing to do.

Itrsquos ironic that a family seen as so removed from the world of ordinary people should find that its greatest weakness lies in something so simple and everyday as the act of falling in love.Love has been a curse for the family since its inception. The House of Windsor only came into being in . Until then the family was the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. But in the midst of the First World War that was too Germanic, and George V ndash Queen Elizabethrsquos grandfather ndash changed the name to the House of Windsor.The Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line slipped into the royal lineage in  with the marriage of Prince Albertto Queen Victoria. So itrsquos here, at the point of this wedding, that the roots of the House of Windsor are found. Itrsquos also here that we see the first shadows of the curse of love start to stalk the family. That curse would play out through the generations ndash all the way to the crisis today centred on Harry and Meghan.Britain likes to think of Victoria and Albertrsquos marriage as a beautul love affair ndash and in many respects it was. But it was also an obsessional relationship. When Albert died in , Victoria wasnrsquot just grief-stricken, she was left devastated for the rest of her le.Like many aristocrats, the young Victoria was starved of love. She described her childhood as ldquomelancholy. As a result, Albert became her world. When he died, she entered a state of mourning that lasted until her death. Victoria only wore black from then on. She avoided the public eye. She began comfort-eating and gained weight ndash which only increased her sense of unhappiness.:Harry and Meghan will not use HRH titles or get royal funds - palaceLove ndash or rather the loss of her object of love ndash broke Victoria emotionally. Even now, looking back more than  years later, we can see that here, right at very beginning of what would eventually become the House of Windsor, this family has always been unable to love as others love. Love is easy for no-one but for many of the Windsors love is either impossible, unattainable, or fatally damaging.Some in the family seem incapable of love ndash like Victoriarsquos son, Edward VII. He married Princess Alexandra of Denmark in . It was a typical mid-th century royal wedding, in that love had little to do with the match ndash as can be judged by Edwardrsquos numerous and very public affairs. He had a relationship with the actress Lillie Langtry, one of the most famous women of the age.Edward had affairs with around  women, sleeping with countesses and prostitutes. In his s, he began a relationship with a married -year-old aristocrat called Alice Keppel ndash the great-grandmother of Camilla, now Duchess of Cornwall and the second we of Prince Charles. Alicersquos husband knew about the affair and accepted it. It was even rumoured that Alicersquos child, Sonia Keppel ndash Camillarsquos grandmother ndash was Edwardrsquos daughter.Edward and Alexandrarsquos wedding also created the first major clash with the press over access to the royals when it came to matters of the heart. Newspapers were unhappy that the wedding was to take place in Windsor rather than London. Windsor meant smaller crowds, and fewer reporters.Back in the Edwardian era, the British press was not the rottweiler it is today ndash it was obsequious to the royals, seldom reporting anything which would embarrass the family. However, the kingrsquos affairs were so notorious that even the tame Edwardian commentators of the time couldnrsquot ignore what was happening. In , British MP Sir Charles Mordaunt threatened to name Edward in his orce case ndash and the then heir to the throne was called as a witness. The scandals surrounding Edward were containable, because of the deferential time period they took place in, but they were nonetheless damaging to the family.:Duke of Sussex the face of groundbreaking Rugby League World Cup mental health campaignThe press was not so tame when the next great love story came to shake what was now officially the House of Windsor ndash and the damage would be greater than ever. The fallout of the love affair between Edward VIII and Mrs Wallis Simpson in , and the resulting abdication crisis, has become almost a template for doomed Windsor romances.At its heart the Edward and Mrs Simpson story tells us this: the Windsors try desperately to love as others do, they want to be with the people their hearts tell them to be with, but their position prevents them from doing so. As a result two things happen ndash they become wounded human beings, and the institution of the monarchy is simultaneously wounded in the eyes of the British people for its cruelty and coldness.Such a similar story would go on to play out time and again in the lives of Princess Margaret, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and Prince Harry. The curse seems to hand itself down from generation to generation.The collision between religion and monarchy lies at the heart of Edward VIIIrsquos battle to marry the woman he loved. Religion has haunted royal love lives before ndash there would be no Church of EnglandHenry VIII hadnrsquot wanted to leave Catherine of Aragon for Anne Boleyn. When Henry broke with Rome in the s over the separation, he established himself as Defender of the Faith, the supreme head of the Church of England. More than  years later, that title would haunt Edward VIII and see his love for Wallis Simpson end his reign.In January , Edward VIII, who had embarked on a series of affairs, many with married women, assumed the throne. His father, George V, had said: ldquoAfter I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in  months. Edwardrsquos reign would last barely a year. In , hersquod met the orcee Wallis Simpson and the pair became lovers.In November , Edward told Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he wanted to marry Simpson. It was impossible. The church opposed orcees remarrying. As head of the Church of England, Edward couldnrsquot very well break the rules of the institution he led. With the government, church and heads of the Commonwealth against him, Edward had no choice but to abdicate in order to marry Wallis Simpson. His brother, George VI, the Queenrsquos father, assumed the throne.On abdicating, Edward VIII said: ldquoI have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as a king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. The rest of his le was a glamorous waste. He was tormented by the power he had sacriced, and his reputation destroyed by his flirtation with Nazism.History would be replayed a generation later in , when Edward VIIIrsquos niece, Princess Margaret, went through similar suffering over love. The Queenrsquos sister had fallen in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend, a royal courtier and Battle of Britain flying ace. Townsend, who had been equerry to King George VI, was orced from his we.The stigma of the sister of the head of the Church of England marrying a orcee was too much for the establishment. Marrying in a church would have been impossible. Princess Margaret may be remembered for hard partying, but she was also religious, and the idea of marrying outside the church horried her. She was even told she wouldnrsquot be able to receive communion. Winston Churchillrsquos government tried to discourage the relationship, and Margaret was asked to wait two years before marrying Townsend. Then he was effectively banished from the kingdom and sent on government business to Brussels.In the end, the love between Margaret and Townsend couldnrsquot sustain the pressure put upon it. They drted apart, and he married another woman in . Margaret would go on to have a tempestuous, cruel and adulterous marriage with Antony Armstrong-Jones, later Lord Snowdon. They married in  and orced in .There were rumours that Margaret attempted suicide and had a nervous breakdown, though such claims remain either unconfirmed or denied. Whatever the effect on Margaret, like so many in her family she was broken by love.Unconfirmed rumours have also stalked Prince Philip. Throughout his marriage to Queen Elizabeth there has been gossip of affairs. Much of the TV series The Crown ndash which has been fairly accurate,imaginative, with history ndash has centred around hints, whispers, speculation and innuendo surrounding Philiprsquos love le. What we do know for sure is that the Queen was very much in love with Philip when they married. The same cannot be said of her son Prince Charles when he married Lady Diana Spencer.By the time Charles was introduced to Diana in , he had already met the love of his le, Camilla Shand. But like so many Windsor loves the relationship was to be thwarted. The couple got together in . Princess Anne was dating Andrew Parker-Bowles, who had just split up with Camilla. Charles got her on the rebound. The pair were very much in love, it seems, but some royals, such as the Queen Mother and Lord Mountbatten, Prince Philiprsquos uncle and Charlesrsquo mentor, didnrsquot approve.Camilla had lived le as a relatively ldquonormal young woman despite her aristocratic status. The fact that shersquod had lovers made her unsuitable for Charles in the eyes of many senior courtiers. Charlesrsquo godmother Patricia Mountbatten said, in the year Camilla married the Prince of Wales: ldquoWith hindsight, you can say that Charles should have married Camilla when he first had the chance. They were ideally suited, we know that. But it wasnrsquot possible. It could be an epitaph for so many doomed Windsor romances.Biographer Sarah Bradford wrote in her  book Diana that Lord Mountbatten apparently arranged for Charles to be sent overseas on a Royal Navy posting in order to strain the relationship. The machinations of the royal family and its loyal courtiers eventually put an end to the love affair.Camilla ed to Parker-Bowles and married him in . However, by , Charles and Camilla were lovers again. Parker-Bowles didnrsquot object. In , Diana would marry Charles in a seemingly fairy-tale wedding. As Diana would later tell the world, there were three people in the marriage, thanks to Camilla, not two.Diana was seen by the royal family as the perfect bride ndash pure, wholesome, everything Camilla was not. Lord Mountbatten once told the young Charles: ldquoIn a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a we he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone  she might fall for ... It is disturbing for women to have experiencesthey have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.Diana once said of Charles and their relationship: ldquoHersquod found the virgin, the sacricial lamb.Diana would, in a way, end up as a sacrice. As her marriage broke down, she was the most celebrated woman on Earth ndash hunted ruthlessly by the press and paparazzi.With Charles and Camilla in the background, Diana found solace with a lover herself, having an affair with James Hewitt between  and . Charles and Diana eventually separated in .Diana had been starved of affection. After the breakdown of her marriage, she went in search of real romantic love ndash and it would lead her to her death.On August , , Diana and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed were pursued by paparazzi through the streets of Paris late at night. The car they were in crashed, and the worldrsquos most glamorous woman was left dying in the back of a black Mercedes in the Pont de lrsquoAlma tunnel. Soon the entire world was saying that love had killed Diana.Today, the memory of his mother seems to inform every decision Harry makes ndash especially when it comes to his we, Meghan. As a boy, he was forced to walk behind the gun carriage bearing the body of his dead mother in front of the eyes of the world. No parent would want the same horror to shape the lives of their own children.Harry and Meghan now want to step back from their royal duties in the hope of living something which approximates to a ldquonormal le. Like many Windsors before him, Harry wishes to love as other people do. But is that possible for a Windsor  Can the shackles of royalty ever be shaken off As with many royal ldquocrises of the past, the country has split over the announcement. Megxit is the new Brexit. Some wish them well, others see it as an insult to the royal family. The seemingly insurmountable problem for Harry and Meghan, though, is that they wish to retain some of the trappings of royalty ndash the homes, wealth, privilege, titles, the power ndash while esting themselves of the duty, obligations and public scrutiny of le within the House of Windsor.In the end,Harry does wish to live freely, as all people should be allowed to do, then it seems he must abandon those trappings in order to finally break the curse of the House of Windsor, and the tragedy that being a member of that family brings to the simple act of falling in love."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  In post-Brexit Britain  Nicola Sturgeon can t keep telling her troops that Indyref2 is round the corner  It isn t","story":"Hitherto, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted on going down the conventional route of asking Westminsterrsquos permission first.

Belfast native Philippa Whitford, the SNP MP for Central Ayrshire, was a surgeon in the hospital serving the constituency for  years before she was first elected in . Edinburgh Eastrsquos Tommy Sheppard, also originally from Northern Ireland, and Edinburgh North and Leithrsquos Deirdre Brock, who hails from Australia, had lived in the capital since the mid-s.Being schooled in an area ndash or living there for a decade before election ndash is a pretty arbitrary measure of \"localness\" for a politician.Nine of the  MPs fail this unfair test. That is not to say they can not be local ndash or cannot become local after election.Take Alistair Carmichael, MP for Orkney and Shetland for the best part of two decades. Originally from Islay ndash and therefore aware of island culture ndash he was a prosecutor in the north-east of Scotland went he threw his hat into the ring to be a Liberal Democrat candidate in the constituency in the  general election.:New MPs are twice as likely to have private education than constituentsBut Carmichael was not a complete stranger in a seat where \"ferryloupers\" can be frowned upon. He had worked at both of Kirkwallrsquos big hotels, the Albert and the Ayre, a decade or so earlier.After  years representing the area ndash and being re-elected five times ndash does it really make sense to suggest he is not local In Decemberrsquos election two of the SNPrsquos stars ndash MEP Alyn Smith and former MP and TV presenter John Nicolson ndash won seats with which they did not have strong connections. Smith took Stirling. Nicolson secured Ochil and South Perthshire ndash despite muddling the seat with his old East Dunbartonshire constituency at a hustings. But this is far from typical. Ochil is unusual, recently, for having relative outsiders as MPs.Local Labour incumbent Gordon Banks in  lost to an outsider, London-born, Edinburgh-raised and Glasgow-based Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. She was in turn defeated in  by an English-born-and-raised Tory called Luke Graham . Mr Graham insists he is staying in his Perthshire home after his unseating.Some Scots can take a pretty liberal attitude to what qualies someone to be regarded as compatriot. Politicians, for example, talk about migrants as \"new Scots\". As a stateless nation, Scotland has no citizenship. That means nationality can be a vague and even disputed concept. Is is determined by place of birth  Parentage  Accent, dialect or language  Schooling  Long-term residence  Cultural or political affinity The same questions apply to what makes a politician ndash or anyone ndash considered as local.Back in Rutherglen, newly elected Ferrier admitted there are those who will never accept her as local, even after decades.Ruglonians, she explained, can be a proud bunch after living in the shadow of Glasgow.She said: ldquoRutherglen is a really interesting constituency because people have really got to live there forever ndash they have got to be born in Cambuslang ndash before you are fully accepted as local. I moved in to the area about  years ago, from the neighbouring ward in Glasgow.ldquoSometimes you do get asked that question: where do you come from ldquoVoters really do believe you are going to care more about the constituency because you live in it yourself and you have some history there.Did it make a dference to her campaign that she was local  Ferrier thinks so. ldquoIt probably did help that Ged was local as well, whereas the other candidates they did not live locally though they were local councillors.Ferrier first took the seat in the great SNP surge of , turning around a , majority for the incumbent Tom Greatrex, then one of New Labourrsquos rising stars. Greatrex, who had replaced a local stalwart Tommy McAvoy in , did live locally ndash but he was originally from Kent and has since left the area.: Gordon Brown: UK will have to changeScotland is to stayFerrer said her local credentials gave her an advantage. After she in turn lost, she stayed put and fought to get her seat back.ldquoWhen I lost the seat in , I was still living in the constituency, she said. ldquoThat actually makes it more dficult for you when you are no longer the MP because people are recognising you and you have to go about constituency in your day-to-day business and there is nowhere to hide, really.ldquoAfter I lost the seat, I had community events to go to in my diary. I made a point of still going to them. That was dficult to do but it was the best thing I could have done. It meant I was facing the public I had supported and represented for the last two years.Margaret Ferrier is not a politician you will often see on your TV or making glib remarks on social media.But there is a very high chance,you live in Rutherglen or Cambuslang or Hamilton, that she has chapped your door, or turned up at a church or community event. SNP activists, moreover, describe her as a leafleting champion.Whenever there is an by-election or a campaign, she is the kind of stalwart who runs a street stand. ldquoI am a hard worker, she said. ldquoI like to talk to as many constituents as I can. And try to convince them to vote for me. That is my politics: putting in the graft.Ferrier admits she is not a big fighter in the national political air war ndash she sees that as less of a priority.ldquoIt is the people in your constituency who vote for you and they want to see you,\" she said. \"They want to see you are investing yourself, to make sure you do your case work diligently. For me, the bit at the end is the publicity. Someone  may say the publicity side is more important.Political insiders believe this kind of electioneering, especially against a local opponent, takes some of the nastiness out of politics.Ferrier agreed. She said debate with Killen was ldquocivil. But she stressed activists still faced abuse. ldquoWe had to report incidents to the local police. It is about how you handle that. I have been on so many doors now I reckon I can handle most situations. However, you have got to consider your activists as well. It is really important to train them properly. It is all about safety.As a Labour councillor and MP who expressed the working-class backlash against his party after the independence referendum, Killen is no stranger to doorstep anger either. It is, he said, now getting better for his party as memories fade of its  Better Together alliance with the Conservatives.So Killen recognises the abuse Ferrier cites. But he also thinks disagreements on fundamental issues ndash such as whether Scotland should remain in the UK ndash can be better curated by local politicians arguing in good faith.ldquoPolitics is becoming more heated, he said. ldquoAll of us, I think need to tackle that and keep things respectful and cordial.However, he believes it is just that bit harder to go negative on somebody you could end up running into again and again.He said: ldquoI donrsquot go in that style of campaigning but I think it would be far easier to attack somebody who was being parachuted in from where.ldquoI just bumped into Clare Haughey, who is a local SNP MSP ndash these are people you do see out and about on the streets.ldquoIt doesnrsquot mean you donrsquot criticise, of course, you do, but we all understand it is not personal. You criticise the policies.ldquoI would not pass Margaret without saying hello to her and she would be the same. We would see each other at dferent community events. When I was the MP, she was at a lot of things.ldquoNo-one likes anyone to be bitter or partisan when it is a community-minded issue. If you are both local, that certainly has an impact.The SNP now occupies space ndash both actual communities and centre-left policies ndash once firmly held by Labour. Nationally, this can look like a brutal conflict over small dferences, and the constitution. Locally, it can mean working together.In two-way Labour-SNP marginals such as Rutherglen, it is hard to compete with somebody with whom you basically agree on many things.ldquoIn a seat like mine the competition was between Labour and the SNP, Killen said. ldquoYou do try and find your voice in there.ldquoI am not one for negative campaigning and I never have been. I just go for what message Irsquom trying to put across rather pick out any flaws in the SNP.ldquoApart from the big constitutional issue ndash which is important and obviously does ide people ndash I donrsquot have any worries about how the SNP would go on most other issues.ldquoBecause policy-wise, Labour and the SNP are very aligned on most things.Killen contrasted this with neighbouring Lanark and Hamilton-East, a three-way marginal where Tories were seen as viable contenders.ldquoThere, he said, ldquo it wasnrsquot going to be Labour I would prefer it to be SNP so it wasnrsquot a Tory and I think a lot of people would feel the same.There is something odd about voter attitudes to politicians, Killen reckoned. The public tend to despise MPs in general but to respect their own local ones. Yet most MPs are local to somewhere.Killed explained. ldquoThere is a disconnect between what the overall view of politicians is ndash that they are in it for themselves ndash and the view of local ones. People will often say the person who represents our area is OK but the rest of them are not.ldquoNine times out of  people stand because they live in the area, they care about it and they want to represent it. One of the other reasons that such a high proportion of MPs are local is because of the way that parties run their selections.ldquoParty members much prefer to select candidates who live in the area. Because they believe that person has a better understanding of what the issues re and would do a better job of representing the area.But does this work  Do local parties get better results because they select local candidates  Killen is not so sure.ldquoI do think although the local thing is important, he said. ldquoI would only want to stand somewhere with which Irsquom familiar, somewhere I live.ldquoBut I do think more and more politics, or at least electoral results, are becoming about the air war. You only have to look at how unorm the swings are.ldquoBeing a good local candidate does have an impact. However, unless you are very, very well know it is not going to decide the result.ldquoI have heard people put the local personal factor at about five percent, which seems to me probably about right.ldquoAs long as I have been in politics it has steadily got more presidential, more about the air war. Yet people still like their MP to be local and to live in the area."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2-mandate-claims-dubious-says-sir-john-curtis","story":"Curtice, who teaches at the University of Strathclyde, said the election result was an inadequate way of judging support for a second poll.Instead, the professor said, two polls carried out during the election campaign were a better way of quantying public feeling towards the policy.In a blog on his website What Scotland Thinks, Curtice said using the number of seats to claim a mandate does not take into account the effect of the first-past-the-post system, and how it calculates seats from votes.:SNPs Ian Blackford calls Boris Johnson a democracy denier for rejecting independence voteNeither should the SNP claim a mandate based on share of the vote at the December election because voters may not have agreed with the SNP stance on the referendum, but still voted for them regardless, he said.The SNP won  seats in the December vote, an increase of  from their previous tally, leading to senior figures in the party claiming it is time for a second independence referendum.A week later, the First Minister formally asked for the powers to hold a referendum from the Prime Minister, something he rejected this week.However, Curtice claims that two polls conducted during the election campaign present a better picture of attitudes towards another referendum than the General Election.He said: ldquoOne of these polls came from Ipsos Mori, the other from Panelbase.

Thompson was on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday. He was deemed such a VIP the producers showed footage of him arriving at New Broadcasting House in London, an honour usually reserved for visiting Prime Ministers and the like. Not that you would confuse Mr Thompson with a politician: the Starbucks coffee cup marked him out as an easy like Sunday morning meeja type.: Unionist boycott should not invalidate voteMarr began by flattering his former boss. When Thompson arrived at the NYT it was an old fashioned news empire in pretty ropey shape, he said, ldquoa classic case of the inevitable decline of the mainstream media. But Thompson had turned things around, doubling revenue and attracting five million subscribers. How Three things, said Thompson. First, they took on  more journalists to boost content. ldquoIf you can be dferent, and this in a way is the Netflix tactic, pour money into content, make great content, then yoursquoll get customers. Next, more hiring: this time of software engineers. Third, the running of the main print paper was given over to a handful of people.With the Sunday papers full of Harry and Meghan leaving the UK to spend most of their time in North America, Thompson was askedthe couple could expect a quieter time from the media there. ldquoMuch of the American press is much more high-minded than the British press, he said, showing he has not lost the ability, common in BBC director generals, of getting right up the noses of the red tops.Thompson was visiting just as the BBC is living through another period of interesting times. There were murmurings from the Conservatives during the General Election about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee and forcing the BBC not to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now the party has a large majority it is in a position to make its threats real.: Question Time row rumbles onDecriminalising would cost the BBC pound-pound million, Thompson estimated. Something  was going on, he feared. ldquoI worry that decriminalisation is a de facto beginning of the abolition of the licence fee but without the courage to say that, and put it out to the public to say whether or not they want a properly funded BBC or not.As for scrapping free licences for the over-s, Thompson recalled the same idea being put to him by the Coalition Government. ldquoThey came with a drop dead, wersquore going to do this, back in .Thompson walked out of the meeting and got on the train home to Oxford. On the way he started to mentally compose his resignation letter.The phone went: it was Jeremy Hunt, then Culture Secretary, asking him toand continue talking.Years later, when the Conservatives won a majority on their own, the Chancellor behind the first proposal, George Osborne, came calling again. This time he got his way. By then, Thompson was in New York.Back to the present day and talk of the future. The BBC, like all ldquolegacy media had to attract a younger audience, said Thompson. ldquoIf we donrsquot radically change and start thinking about the audience of the future the risk is we age out with a given generation of people and we all are beaten by companies like Netflix.Commercial media in the UK, like in most European countries, was in ldquoreal trouble, said Thompson, with local journalism in danger of disappearing. If you were waiting to hear him tackled on the BBCrsquos part in commercial mediarsquos woes, hard luck.: How local is your MPThompsonrsquos time at the head of the BBC coincided not just with introducing ratings giants such as Strictly Come Dancing and Sherlock, and presiding over successes such as the iPlayer.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent.

He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work.

The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families.

Nine miles I tell you – that’s a Sunday School trip with juice and crisps in your packed lunch box before you even think about running along the West Sands to the strains of Vangelis.: General election: Why I’m scunnered with politics these days – Kevan Christie: After  years, I can finally say it: I hate golf – Kevan ChristieThis carry-on, which is straying into ‘a piece of nonsense’ territory, came to the picturesque Fe mining village of Crossgates where I live the other day.No sooner had I left the grounds of the estate in the Toyota Auris,  plate, than I ran into three sets of temporary traffic lightsthat had turned Main Street into a scene reminiscent of the final hours of the Battle of Stalingrad.Humbug Park, Divito’s and Crystal CornerPanic-stricken white van drivers had abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the road as they rushed to the takeaway to get their daily fix of Lorne sausage on a roll.Squads of workers in high-vis jackets crowded round a small transistor radio eagerly waiting to hear what song Ken Bruce had chosen to kick-off his .am Radio  show with before gathering again to listen to the PopMaster quiz at half-ten. Doing anything but working as they let their young hearts run free.Motorists had time to run into the chemist and pick up a prescription in the time it took for the TTLs to change colour. Utter carnage.The cause of all this consternation was the arrival of a fleet, well two... OK one, articulated lorry dropping off building materials at a new development called Crossgates, Dunfermline.This got the old tether up as, to my knowledge, Crossgates has never been in Dunfermline – although I’m sure some parish boundary pedant will be digging out the ancient scrolls in an attempt to justy the unjustiable.We’re a self-proclaimed People’s Republic in ‘The Gates’ with our own shop selling crystals – Crystal Corner – and we’re also home to The Crystal Bar, a target shooting shop, a hairdresser called Kutz for U and the best ice-cream shop in the world – Divito’s.Our football team are Crossgates Primrose who play at the beautully named Humbug Park where Scotland legend Jim Baxter first graced the turf.So you can keep Dunfermline with their Pars, fancy Abbey, Robert the Bruce and his Spiders from Mars.I may add that none of the above have paid me in cash for the shameless plugs and the four boxes of Caramel Wafers I received are on the cusp of their sell-by date, give or take a day or two,No plug for property developersBut the property developers – who shall remain nameless – have felt compelled to attach the name of the nearest big toon to the new houses in the hope this attracts the aspirational . children brigade and their funny wee yappy dugs. “Be gone with your toonie ways – there’ll be no avocado on toast in my backyard.”The area around Dunfermline has doubled in the last few years with no end of new builds springing up in the Duloch Park suburb – which is handyyou’re looking for next-day deliveries from the Amazon warehouse just off the M and a manageable commute to Edinburgh. They also have their own giant Tesco for the milk and maltesers. “Come to Duloch, where dreams are made.”It sometimes takes a while for things like medical practices and schools to catch up when developers decide to create a small town in a field in the middle of nowhere but residents will be spoiled for choice when the inevitable fast-food outlets arrive ahead of the game.All of these shenanigans remind me of a friend from the old country over there in Embra, where this kind of stuff really matters, who told everyone he was from posh Ravelston as he shared the same EH postcode as them.The fact that he lived a stone’s throw from his local The Doo’Cot Pub in sunny Drylaw mattered not a jot as he fancied a better class of pigeon that hung around the “bought hooses” up the road.Upper DuddingstonMy friend and I also like to tell people “we’re old Academy boys” and enjoy watching the confused look on their faces as they try to work out how you can talk like that after going to Edinburgh Academy when we really mean the Leith version.Duddingston and Corstorphine are just two of many ‘desirable’ areas of the Capital that are rapidly expanding with estate agents quick to crowbar anywhere within a five-mile radius into their listings.So, the perfectly decent housing estate of Magdalene becomes Upper Duddingston and similarly Clermiston is incorporated into Corstorphine in the minds of the deluded to whom these things matter.I recently heard the Bellevue area described as North New Town which is a bit of a leap in terms of increasing property values.We can all laugh at this status anxiety and I’m sure everyone can name an area from their part of the country where this exists – a network of spam valleys.Conversely, hipster types look to the more edgy parts of town like Leith in the hope of gaining a bit of street cred and I’m starting a campaign to make Piershill trendy.My last bit of advice folks is to keep your eyes peeled for this type of shenanigans andyou see a sign for new builds that’s been vandalised with marker pen changing “near” to “nowhere near”, it wisnae me.

He put himself at odds with other senior Nationalist figures in  by actively campaigning for a Leave vote ahead of the Brexit referendum, arguing that Brussels was a “barrier” to independence.In the wake of Mr Johnson’s letter, some in the SNP have argued Sturgeon must now explore possible “plan Bs” to securing independence.The First Minister has made it clear she views the process laid down by the  Edinburgh Agreement, which paved the way for the referendum two years later, as the “gold standard”.But Sillars said: “None of the plan Bs I have heard of are credible.“What the independence movement must do now is stop marching and start thinking. They must realise we have quite a way to go.“We have to build up a level of support for independence that cannot be defeated and that is some time away. Patience is required.”Former Holyrood justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, who recently ed to frontline politics as the new SNP MP for East Lothian, last week called for a “coming together” of parliamentarians and others around the issue of “Scotland’s right to decide its own future”.He said “time is of the essence”a new constitutional convention was to be established to build support for a second independence referendum.That position was backed today by Christopher McEleny, an SNP councillor on Inverclyde Council who previously called for other options to a section  order to be explored.“I think the proposal for a constitutional convention must be taken very seriously,” he said. “As much as everyone agrees Boris Johnson’s position is undemocratic, I don’t want to be sitting in five or ten years’ time making the same argument that we must have a choice.“I think we need a strategy in place so we can put political pressure on Boris Johnson. Hoping or wishing that he agrees to a section  order is certainly not going to be good enough.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp msp alex neil boycott of wildcat independence referendum won t matter","story":"Nationalist MSP Alex Neil also suggested a campaign of civil disobedience was needed to force the UK Government into granting a Section  order, giving Holyrood the power to hold indyref.Boris Johnson last week confirmed he would not considering granting permission for a second referendum, and his Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has claimed even a pro-independence referendum at the  Scottish Parliament election wouldnrsquot change the position.: Scottish independence campaigners should lsquostop marching and start thinkingrsquo, says SNP veteranSpeaking on the BBCrsquos Politics Scotland programme, Mr Neil - a former Scottish Government cabinet minister - argued that the Scottish Parliament already had the power to hold a consultative referendum that would change the facts on the groundit is won by the pro-independence side.\"The political reality is,you run a legal, consultative referendum, and the result was in favour of independence, the games a bogey for the Union, because the political reality is ndash thats it.\"Asked what would happenthe pro-Union side boycotted a consultative referendum, Mr Neil said: \"Its not a Catalonia situation where, according to the Unionists, the Spanish constitution made the Catalonian referendum unconstitutional and they boycotted it.\"Theres a very big dference between boycotting an unconstitutional, illegal referendum and boycotting a legal referendum. \"So the point Im making is, lets seea consultative referendum, at the right time, could be legal.\"He added: \"Politically, I think its a very important distinction, becauseyou decide to abstain in a legal referendum ndash as a third of the people do regularly in general elections, decide to abstain ndash it doesnt change the result. \"And the rest of the people who want to vote in a legal referendum, even those who do not want to boycott it but want to vote against independence ndash they cant be held to ransom because the Conservative Party and their cronies are going to abstain.\"Asked what would happenthe UK Government never granted the powers for indyref to take place, Mr Neil compared the situation to independence movements in former Soviet republics and post-imperial India, saying: \"They said that about the Baltic states in terms of the USSR.\"Of course we all know people pressure ndash remember the people holding hands between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  : Euan McColm: Frustration grows as Nicola Sturgeon urges one more heave for independence\"If it comes to that kind of demonstration by the Scottish people to force the issue, then thats what happens. \"If you look at India ndash India didnt have a referendum.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"man handed payback order and told to pay compensation ","story":"A man was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work and told to pay £ in compensation after he admitted taking a backpack from a pub which did not belong to him.Richard Oswald Layfield, , of Horseshoe Close, Virkie, was in the Douglas Arms pub in December  when he took the pack, believing it to belong to a friend he was with at the time.But when he got outside he realised the bag, in fact, belonged to somebody .Instead of putting it back, however, he held onto it – and its contents, which included a £ i-phone, £ in cash and a set of car keys.Layfield admitted a charge of reset when he appeared in the dock before Sherf Ian Cruickshank yesterday.Procurator fiscal Duncan MacKenzie said it would have been simple for Layfield to have rectied his mistake.“It was not the case that he was in a drunken state.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots.

The god of just-in-timedelivery doesn’t care about any of that. Neither does Ricky’s boss, theself-appointed “patron saint of nasty bastards.”Thereisn’t even enough time to go to the toilet. On his first day with PDF, Ricky ishanded an empty plastic bottle by a co-worker. For male drivers in a hurry, itis an essential piece of equipment.Ricky’smachine-tooled existence is mirrored by his we’s.

When Abbie tells her that her own working day is from .am to pm,Rosie counters with: “What happened to the eight-hour day ”It is a pivotal scene.

Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing. The extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.“I want to thank Vertex pharmaceuticals for finally giving in, eventhey were slow on the mark and I was too close to death for them to make the bloody decision but nevertheless.“I also want to thank my amazing family and friends for being there from day one and everyone who has followed my story. I am just a normal girl from Newtownabbey who wanted to help myself and others with cystic fibrosis speak out and get the drugs we deserve.“It is proof that three little tablets saved my le. I hope  is the year that Nicole kicks cystic fibrosis’s ass.“I have never been more happy to be sitting in my own home like a normal person. I am going to take this opportunity to eat, sleep, relax and repeat.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

There will be a lot more activity from the unusually quiet four piece I’m assured. Very little other craic at the minute. .Squakdon’t have anything organised yet man..Rebecca Mulhernhas nothing on except uni stuff. googletag.cmd.push .Paddy Nashis hinting a vinyl compilation of all his material later in the year. He also describes a few releases and some solo tours as nothing much. Luckily for them Paddy doesn’t compare himself to other artists. .Basorkhave an announcement to make soon. .Fast Thursdayare flat out recording an album at the minuteandhave very few gigs planned so far. .Ryan Vailhas new music lined up and loads of live shows. .George Huttontells me “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast, th Feb. I’ll be releasing my new album in Feb also and on the th Feb I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and the Priests. I’ve been asked to be a judge on BBC School Choir of the year, and they want me to perform live on the BBC in the Guildhall before the final, but I haven’t been given a green light to put that out there yet! Hopefully will today or tomorrow! Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best”. googletag.cmd.push .Nazirtold me “Working on my next release which I’m hoping to have out in the next month or so, I’d love to playCeltronic again but I guess I won’t know about that for a while, some technical things with involve are holding us back but as soon as we get that sorted I’ll let u know!” .Caitlin Nashsaid, “I have no clue at the minute because I’m heading back to uni soon but I’m hoping to get a few projects done over there and here when I’m back in the summer”. . At some point we’ll work out why  People don’t get paid for playing gigs. . In April Reevahwill be releasing “A Dferent Light” and she’ll also be heading out on a UK Irish tour as well as putting the finishing touches on her debut album which will be out either by the end of this year or the start of next year. .Declan McLaughlinis feeling nostalgic and will be celebrating his entire career this year, from The Screaming Bin Lids to The Whole Tribe Sings to Central Drive to The Hi Flats, share the love on his Facebook page. . If you’re not really a fan of music then mrk my words, there’s plenty of bland music going live this year. .Roewill be releasing a couple of singles this year with an e.p. on its way after the summer.  Noella Hutton has a new album coming out soon.  .Noella Huttonhas a new album coming very soon called “Love  Liars” and you can check out the video for her video for “I’m Going Crazy” from that album on her Facebook page. .Bloodhaven’t gone away you know. .

It was tough on a St Louis team who brought so much to the table, notched some fine scores and had a stoppage time goal ruled out before the game went to extra-time. Throw-in was delayed  minutes, such was the attendance. After playing second fiddle to a dominant but wasteful St Louis for much of the first-half, Maghera were still in touch and only trailed - to - at the break. googletag.cmd.push Ballymena had their exceptional goalkeeper Orlagh Convery to thank for some vital first-half interventions including a breath-taking reflex save to deny Aimee Lennon after Clare Gunnings rasper came off the bar. Caitlin Crawford extended the St Louis lead from a free but with Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, Maghera began to dominate. A fine Caoimhe Molloy point on the break looked like it would inspire St Louis but when Maghera substitute Niamh McCullaghs shot went all the way to the net to open a - to - lead, the game changed. Molloy, like her younger sister Katie, excelled for St Louis. Her thundering nd minute shot to the roof of the Maghera net put them ahead. googletag.cmd.push - POLL Who was player of the match  Vote here... It looked to have captured a first title for the Ballymena school in  years but there was still more drama to follow. First, Clare Gunning leveled the game before yet another twist. Caoimhe Molloy raced goalwards before dispatching a shot that dipped into the top corner with virtually the last puck of the game, but it was ruled out by referee ONeill for too many steps. For much of the second-half, players from both teams went down with cramp. However, following an agreement between both schools earlier in the day, extra-time was played. The games hammer blow was delivered by Clare Gunning, who sank St Louis with her goal in the first attack. It was followed by a third Maghera goal from Blathnaid McLaughlin at the start of the second period of extra-time. Magheras defence, in which Aimee Lennon played a pivotal role in extra-time, kept St Louis to a Molloy point and the cup was on its way back to Maghera.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A progressive society must be a society that works for all its citizens.”Ms Mullan said: “It marks a momentous step for LGBTQ+ people across the North, as same-sex couples receive the long-awaited right to register to marry the person they love and finally have their relationships recognised as equal before the law. “This day is one to be celebrated and is a major milestone in the journey to full equality for all citizens on this island, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. “I would like to pay tribute to all those who campaigned for so long to demand equality, inclusion and fair treatment today is theirs.“The fight for marriage equality has been just one element in the struggle of the LGBTQ+ community, and although this is a massive achievement, we still have a way to go.“Sinn Feacutein is determined to see government which works for everyone, that is our pledge for this mandate.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The group fuse Celtic classics with modern pop and folk with their programmeinspired by traditional Irish music that has been mixed and merged with more modern music from Irish artists such as U, Van Morrison and Snow Patrol.The programme also includes work from other artists including Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and even songs from “The Greatest Showman,” all given an Irish twist. Musical arrangements are by Toby Nelms, creative staging by Ian Good. Twenty-seven-year-old Conor is a graduate of Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts and has worked extensively as an actor-musician. Coming from a family of seisiuacuten musicians and singers, he is particularly delighted to share the trad-pop fusion that The Four Harps have created. As well as Conor, the group also consists of -year-old Ryan Lynch, from Strabane, -year old Kevin Fagan from Dublin and -year old Fergal O’Hanlon from Galway.Having trained at Northumbria University and Associated Studios London, group creator Ryan has appeared in several productions including new musicals such as The Clockmaker’s Daughter. Most recently he toured the world with a major cruise line playing leading roles in popular musicals including “Tony” in “West Side Story.” Fiercely proud of his roots, he has always loved Irish music and in  developed a solo show singing some of his favourite songs. The response was so positive that he decided the way forward was to further develop the idea and form a four-piece male harmony group. With a busy work schedule it wasn’t until earlier this year that he was able to bring together the right line-up.The boys have already performed at the Kinky Kaberet, The Phoenix Arts Club, Archer Street, Soho, The Concorde Club, Southhampton, The Above the Stag Theatre and Picadilly’s, Crazy Coqs, Live At Zedel.Kevin has worked as a performer since childhood as a cabaret host and singer and actor. He is proud of his Celtic background and thrilled to be a string of The Four Harps. Fergal is the newest member of the team. He trained in Ireland and has appeared in ious film and stage productions, including work in the USA.It is now full steam ahead with recording sessions and a potential Britishand Irish tour. Ryan is confident The Four Harps and their programme of music, which includes “The Irish Rover,” “Danny Boy,” “You Raise Me Up” and “With or Without You,” will have a wide appeal. He said it was their aim to introduce the beauty of Celtic music and voices to the world intend to tour their shows internationally.The Playhouse performance will take place on Saturday,  March, starting at :pmgt tickets are priced pound. pound.. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal.

They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety. In addition, urgent action is needed to ban large vehicles, especially lorries, from this built-up area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Looking.jpg","title":"Looking back at end of steam railways  ","story":"SEVENTY years ago today, the first part of Northern Irelandrsquos railway network literally came to the end of the line, with the axe falling on a large part of the old Belfast and County Down Railway, marking the end of  years of railway transport in East Down.On January , , railway stations south of Comber fell quiet and an eerie silence descended upon mile after mile of what had once been a key transport corridor.No longer would the rumble of trains and passenger-filled carriages pass through on their way to Castlewellan or Newcastle, stopping at Ballygowan, Saintfield, Ballynahinch junction, Crossgar, or Dundrum on the way, or perhaps branching off after Downpatrick for Ardglass.Later, on April , , services from Belfast to Comber - with stops at Bloomfield, Neillrsquos Hill, Knock, Dundonald and on to Donaghadee also ceased.Robert Gardiner, chairman of the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, a heritage railway set up on the former Downpatrick BCDR terminus, states that had the line survived to today, it would form a vital transport link between the commuter belt into the Northern Irish capital.ldquoIt seems incredible today to think that such a vital transport link could be easily discarded, he says. ldquoBut in  the ministers in the devolved Stormont Government took the view that railways were as obsolete as the stagecoach.ldquoIn a way, they were right that the lines were Edwardian relics mdash and the BCDR in particular still operated obsolete Victorian carriages mdash but investment since then in new technologies in track, signalling and rolling stock have shown what we could have had throughout Northern Ireland.ldquoBut even then, in  an express train from Comber to Belfast could get you into the old Queenrsquos Quay station near the Odyssey area in  minutes ndash despite the investment in the Glider and other public transport initiatives nothing has come close to replicating that speed and efficiency.Up to the s, the main railway network in Northern Ireland was operated by three major railway companies mdash the London Midland and Scottish Railwayrsquos Northern Counties lines, which operated out of York Road Station to Larne and Londonderry the Great Northern Railway of Ireland, which operated out of Great Victoria Street Station to places like Dungannon, Armagh, as well as Dublin and the Belfast and County Down Railway, based at Queenrsquos Quay Station.In , the Stormont government decided to nationalise the network and amalgamate the LMS and BCDR with the bus operator, the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, to form the Ulster Transport Authority, a predecessor to Translink.Mr Gardiner explains, ldquoA tribunal was set up to consider how this could be best achieved and provide an integrated transport system. Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

Maybe its just a bit of magic dust, but itrsquos definitely a unique ability to get players to play for him.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what age you are. If you are good enough, he will give you a chance, he added.ldquoDonrsquot forget we won the Ulster League last season with five or six minors starting regularly every week.ldquoThat injection of youth sure helped the lads get a great start to the season and everything fell into place after that, he continued.Gilligan also believes that Moranrsquos love for the game and the way it should be played has rubbed off on the players.ldquoMickey is extremely keen on discipline. He insists the players play the game and let the referee do his thing without being shouted at.ldquoHe doesnrsquot rant or rave from the sidelines and expects that same response from the players and gets it, he added.Dedication and team structure are what he has instilled at Eoghan Rua Parc and a love for the game along with a winning environment.Kilcoo have been the benchmark in Down football for the past decade, but Moran has taken them a stage further in just  months.Corofin may be blessed with several players who have turned out regularly for Galway and in Kieran Fitzgerald, Liam Silke, Kieran McGrath, Gary Sice and Ian and Daithi Burke they have the nucleus of a talented outfit.However, Kilcoo believe they bigger they are, the harder they fall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister vows to end strikes with pay deal  ","story":"HEALTH staff across the district were yesterday digesting the news that new Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann had confirmed that pay parity with their colleagues in England can now be restored.He told the Assembly that it would cost an extra poundm that would come from within existing Stormont finances.Mr Swann met with representatives from a number of leading health trade unions to brief them on the decision, describing the talks as ldquoconstructive.The new man in charge of the Provincersquos health portfolio said the ldquobreakthrough that we all wanted has been achieved this isa good day after some very dficult days.Mr Swann announced that the Department of Health had already gathered together poundm to increase pay for health workers, with an extra poundm being pulled from existing finances at Stormont.His decision to address the pay issue came after a series of strikes involving staff across the health and social services sector over pay and staffing levels.Nurses and other health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking industrial action over pay and staffing levels, with Mr Swann confirming that his officials would work with the unions on the issue of safe staffing levels in the health service and hopes a plan can be drawn up to establish such levels ldquowithin a reasonable period of time.Today, representatives from trade unions representing nurses and all health and social services staff will meet with Department of Health officials, with Mr Swann hoping for a ldquoswt end to their industrial action.He added: ldquoOur nurses and great social care workers can come off the picket-line.Prior to yesterdayrsquos announcement, local nurses said that they hoped that theof Stormont would pave the way for the pay parity and staffing issues to be finally addressed.Ahead of yesterdayrsquos meeting, the RCN said while welcoming the restoration of the Stormont administration, nurses had been made many promises.The RCNrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Pat Cullen, said nurses wanted to see those promises converted into action.Last Wednesday and Friday, nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals took part in the latest round of stoppages and were buoyed by the support of passing motorists and others as they manned the picket-line at the entrance to the Downshire Civic Centre.Braving bitterly cold conditions last Friday morning, nurses were hoping for positive news from Stormont, hours after Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney had published the New Decade New Approach document.Nurses, who had sacriced another dayrsquos pay, were joined at one stage on the picket-line by South Eastern Trust interim chief executive Seamus McGoran and Roisin Coulter, the organisationrsquos director of planning.Nurses said that they hoped that the political parties would go back into government and that their demands for pay parity and safe staffing levels would be met.ldquoWe believe that the collective pressure of health service staff has ensured that politicians know that they must get back to Stormont, said nurse Irene Murray.ldquoWe do not want to be used as political pawns and hope that there is cross-party agreement for politicians to get back to work. While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

HELEN MCGURK talks to some people who love the challenge of the black and white grid. Many years ago, due to technical gremlins, the daily crossword did not appear in this newspaper. The next day the phones in the newsroom went crazy as hordes of apoplectic crossworders rang in with plenty of cross words for whatever hapless reporter happened to answer the phone. Staff tried their best to molly the mfed, but it was no easy task.Readers look forward to their newspaper crossword puzzle and feel bereft when, for whatever reason, it doesn’t appear..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button An outside agency supplies the crossword puzzles to the News Letter, but try telling that to Disgusted-of-Dromore, etc, when a setter has made a mistake with  across and our reader has spent hours wracking their brain, trying to solve the unsolvable. Crossworders are ardent in their affection for the puzzle, which first took the US by storm in  when it appeared in a Sunday newspaper, the New York World.Since they enthusiasts have been touting the benefits of crossword puzzles for mental acuity and just good old-fashioned innocent entertainment. There are also numerous health benefits of crossword puzzles since they keep your brain sharp and engaged, something many older people are aware of.A major study published in  suggests people who do a daily crossword have sharper brains as they grow older.Experts said completing the tricky word puzzles often found in the middle of newspapers helps boost attention, reasoning and memory.They estimate by taking part in the challenging quizzes adults can stop their brains ageing by  years.Despite not going as far as saying crosswords could prevent dementia, signicant links between keeping the brain healthy in old age and a reduced risk of the devastating disease have been uncovered in recent years.The ‘very exciting’ findings, led by Exeter University and Kings College London, were based on data from more than , participants.Fire crews called to fix worse-for-wear Wellingborough pub sign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Professor Keith Wesnes, from the University of Exeter, said further research is needed to back-up their initial results.He added: ‘We found direct relationships between the frequency of word puzzle use and the speed and accuracy of performance on nine cognitive tasks assessing a range of aspects ofincluding attention, reasoning and memory.‘‘Performance was consistently better in those who reported engaging in puzzles, and generally improved incrementally with the frequency of puzzle use.’’Isabel Rea, , regularly attends Age NI’s Day Centre at the Skainos Centre in east Belfast, and has been passionate about crossword puzzles since she was a child. ‘‘I would do them in a crossword book. I’m not very brainy, but I do my best at them. ‘‘I’ve done crosswords my whole le, even as a kid. My mother or my father did them and I must have got it from watching them.’’Isabel, who worked in her father’s grocery shop, admits she steers clear of those fiendishly dficult cryptic crosswords, but believes doing even the ‘easier’ ones helps to keep her mind active. ‘‘It helps me with my spelling and I learn new words. ‘‘If there’s a word I don’t understand I’ll look it up in my dictionary.’’Isabel’s friend, Emily Campbell, also loves doing crosswords. The -year-old former weaver said: ‘‘When I’m not knitting, I would look at the papers to seethere is a crossword in it and I would try and do it. ‘‘I think it helps to keep my mind sharp and I learn new words, although some of them I can’t spell.’’Emily said she loves the sense of achievement she gets from finishing a crossword.‘‘I enjoy them, especially when you come to the end and you’ve no more clues to do.’’Like Isabel, Emily doesn’t do cryptic crosswords, but said her husband ‘‘was great at them’’.‘‘He won £ one time for finishing one. We used the money to go out for our dinner one night.’’Denise Molloy, , a volunteer with Age NI, also enjoys the mental gymnastics of a good crossword. ‘‘I wouldn’t be doing The Times or anything like that, I usually do the ones in the Women’s Weekly. ‘‘I haven’t done them in the papers for a long time. My father was great at crosswords.’’Like the other ladies, Denise said she enjoys ‘‘the challenge’’.‘‘ It makes you think. I was quite good at English at school. I like words.‘‘ You feel a sense of achievement when you finish a crossword. ‘‘The odd timeI can’t get a word, I’ve cheated and looked it up in the dictionary. ‘‘And then again, sometimesI can’t get it I would go into the cryptic clues and sometimes get the answer from that.’’ Crosswording is oftenperceived as a solo pursuit, but in reality it is as likely to be a group activity, in the workplace, with parents or as a couple.There is a group of keen crossworders at Milesian Manor in Co Londonderry. One of those is Lita Muldoon.She said: ‘‘When you don’t keep your mind active it can get foggy, crosswords are a great way of clearing your head.‘‘ I like to complete them both alone and sometimes do one with a friend, it’s good to help each other and together we usually manage to finish.’’Fellow resident Linden Mc Kinleyadded: ‘‘I love word searches and crosswords. ‘‘I like to finish first it makes me feel good about myself.’’Moira O’Neill does a crossword every single day. She said: ‘‘I just love the feeling of filling in every box, it makes me feel really good about myself and keeps the mind going a bit longer.’’And Annie Diamond, who is also a dab hand at crosswords, added: ‘‘I like completing them, but don’t like it when the questions are too hard, I am  years old after all! ‘‘The ones I really enjoy have questions about the farming community or baking, I’m really good at those ones.’’Crossword puzzles, whether you are good at them or not, offer a retreat from an increasingly chaotic world. Then, of course, there’s that satisfyingly smug feeling whenyou fill in the last word.Colin Dexter, creator of the crossword addict Inspector Morse, summed it up so well: ‘The hobby and the habit of solving crosswords is the most serene and civilised way of wasting time that I have yet discovered.’’try catch  TrendingPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm BrendanStorm Brendan NI BLOG: Widespread disruption, roads closed, coastal flooding and power outagesWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland weather forecast as widespread frost and cooler temperatures expectedBelfast Celtic defend Jay Donnelly signingThis time its tears of happiness - Cate Conway shares hilarious Stephen Clements prank video involving leopard print leggings        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Latest News\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
