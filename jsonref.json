He was the pope of Francis\u0027 formative years as a young priest in Argentina and was instrumental in giving rise to the Latin American church\u0027s \u0027preferential option for the poor\u0027 that Francis has made his own.Francis also has a close personal connection to Romero, and like him lived through  right-wing military dictatorships when Francis was in Argentina. Francis was responsible for eventually declaring Romero a martyr for his fearless denunciations of the military regime at the start of El Salvador\u0027s 1980-1992 civil war.In his homily, Francis called Paul a \u0027prophet of a church turned outwards\u0027 to care for the faraway poor. He said Romero gave up his security and life to \u0027be close to the poor and his people.\u0027          San Salvador, early morning October 14: The two banners hanging from the National Palace behind read in Spanish: \u0027The cause of all our illnesses are the oligarchy,\u0027 left, and \u0027May my blood be a seed for freedom\u0027  Catholic faithful await the canonisation ceremony of the blessed Monsignor Oscar Romero in his hometown of Ciudad Barrios          Pope Francis  elevated Pope Paul VI and  Oscar Romero to sainthood, praising the two towering figures of the 20th-century Catholic Church as prophets who shunned wealth and looked out for the poorAnd he warned that those who don\u0027t follow their example to leave behind everything, including their wealth, risk never truly finding God.\u0027Wealth is dangerous and - says Jesus - even makes one\u0027s salvation difficult,\u0027 Francis said.\u0027The love of money is the root of all evils,\u0027 he added. \u0027Where money is at the centre, there is no room for God or for man.\u0027For many Salvadorans, it was the culmination of a fraught, politicized campaign to have the church formally honor a man who spoke out for the rights of landless peasants and the poor at a time when the US-backed right-wing government was seeking to quash a leftist rebellion.\u0027We couldn\u0027t stay home on this historic day,\u0027 said Jose Martinez, who with his wife and two young children joined the crowds outside the San Salvador cathedral. \u0027I want my children to know Monsignor, our saint, that he was a great man who raised his voice to defend his pueblo, and for that they killed him.\u0027          A nun takes pictures of a photo exhibit on El Salvador\u0027s martyred Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero          Romero\u0027s hometown of Ciudad Barrios: Almost immediately after his death, Romero became an icon of the South American left and is frequently listed  as one of the world\u0027s most influential human rights campaigners          Romero\u0027s influence continues to resonate with El Salvador\u0027s youth as the country endures brutal gang violence that has made the Central American nation one of the world\u0027s most violent Romero, the archbishop of San Salvador, was murdered as he celebrated Mass on March 24, 1980, in a hospital chapel. A day before he was killed, he had delivered the latest in a series of sermons demanding an end to the army\u0027s repression - sermons that had enraged El Salvador\u0027s leaders.Almost immediately after his death, Romero became an icon of the South American left and is frequently listed along with Martin Luther King Jr and Mohandas Gandhi as one of the world\u0027s most influential human rights campaigners. The United Nations commemorates the anniversary of his death each year.But his popularity with the left led to a decades-long delay in his saint-making cause at the Vatican, where right-wing cardinals led by Colombian Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo warned that his elevation would embolden Marxist revolutionaries.Eventually Pope Benedict XVI unblocked the cause and Francis saw it through to its conclusion Sunday.

Under his auspices, the church agreed to allow liturgy to be celebrated in the vernacular rather than in Latin and called for greater roles for the laity and improved relations with people of other faiths.Paul is also remembered for his two most important encyclicals, or teaching documents, which have had a profound effect on the church: One denounced the mounting inequality between rich and poor, and the other reaffirmed the Catholic church\u0027s opposition to artificial contraception.   Francis has also adopted the \u0027church of the poor\u0027 ethos that Paul embodied when Paul formally renounced wearing the bejeweled papal tiara.More than 1,000 Hondurans trek to the US border in \u0027March of...Woman has a SWASTIKA carved onto her stomach by supporters...Pope Francis defrocks two bishops caught in Chile\u0027s widening...Pope Francis says having an abortion is like \u0027hiring a...Kim Jong-un invites the POPE to North Korea... as it is...Pope Francis blames the DEVIL for Catholic Church\u0027s sexual...Share this articlePaul is also very important to Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, whom Paul made a cardinal in 1977.

Because he knew they were going to kill him,\u0027 added university professor Julia Lainez.For a long time, efforts to recognise Romero met with heavy opposition from conservative Catholics and the Salvadoran right, who saw veiled Marxism in his sermons.          Catholic faithful look at candles dedicated to  Romero in  Ciudad Barrios, some 102 miles from San SalvadorBut Francis - the first Latin American pope - beatified Romero as a \u0027martyr\u0027 in 2015, to popular acclaim.Paul VI - who encouraged Romero in his struggle - was the first head of the Roman Catholic Church to attempt to reform the Vatican\u0027s powerful and unruly Curia, the church\u0027s governing body. It was a challenge Francis also took on.Romero is praised for standing up for peasant rights in the face of a right-wing backlash which painted him as a radical supporter of \u0027liberation\u0027 theology in his small, impoverished central American nation.On March 24, 1980, the man dubbed the \u0027voice of those without voice\u0027 was shot in the heart, killed by a single bullet as he prepared communion. His killing came at the start of a bloody civil war which claimed some 75,000 lives.Relics of each new saint were carried to the altar - part of a bone for Romero and the shirt Paul VI was wearing when he was stabbed in an assassination attempt at Manila airport in 1970."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/09/18/19BF0D8800000514-0-image-m-32_1539104575303.jpg","title":"The singer Roger Daltrey reveals saw green exit sign knocking out","story":"    The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey revealed he had a near death experience and saw a green exit sign when knocking himself unconsciousHe told The Sunday Times: \u0027Everything was packing up and none of the doctors could work out why.\u0027He said the pain he felt was \u0027unbearable.

Hernandez (pictured in 2007) shined as a pass receiver with SanSoucie, the team quarterback          In the first four games of their junior year, the pair had nine touchdown completions. But off the field he was developing a connection with SanSoucie that went far deeper than sportTo outside observers, Hernandez\u0027s father Dennis was the ultimate supportive dad. When he suddenly died at the age of 49, during his younger son\u0027s junior year, many believed it crushed Hernandez and marked the beginning of his downfall.           The pair first began exploring a sexual relationship in middle school, which SanSoucie said continued into high school. Pictured is SanSoucie in 2007But his brother has since revealed that their father ran a home where  homophobia was rampant and abuse was the ultimate motivational tool.Jonathan Hernandez, the NFL star\u0027s older brother, said his father long had concerns that Hernandez \u0027had a feminine way about him\u0027.He closely watched at how his youngest son \u0027stood or used his hands\u0027. And he became enraged when a young Hernandez expressed interest in cheerleading. \u0027He wanted to be a cheerleader. My cousins were cheerleaders and amazing,\u0027 Jonathan, 32, recalled. \u0027And I remember coming home and my dad put an end to that real quick. And it was not okay. My dad made it clear that he had his definition of a man.\u0027 Their father also frequently threw around the term \u0027f****t\u0027, which Jonathan said he used \u0027all the time\u0027.           \u0027Me and him were very much into trying to hide what we were doing,\u0027 SanSoucie, who later joined the US Marines, told the Globe. \u0027We didn\u0027t want people to know\u0027          SanSoucie himself only decided to come out to his family and friends after Hernandez\u0027s death. \u0027I really, truly feel in my heart I got the thumbs-up from him,\u0027 he said\u0027Standing. Talking. Acting. Looking. It was the furthest thing my father wanted you to even look like in our household,\u0027 he said. \u0027This was not acceptable to him.\u0027 And Dennis Hernandez was a man to be feared in the Hernandez household, ruling his sons with an iron fist. Sometimes they came as punishment, such as when their father left Hernandez with a black eye because he drank before a school dance.Sometimes they came when their father felt his boys weren\u0027t working hard enough in school or at football. Other times they came for no discernible reason at all.One time it got so bad that Jonathan threatened to call the authorities. But Dennis Hernandez remained unfazed.           But his brother has since revealed that Hernandez\u0027s father Dennis (pictured with his brother Jonathan) ran a home where homophobia was rampant          Jonathan Hernandez said their father Dennis long had concerns that Hernandez \u0027had a feminine way about him\u0027.

Pictured is Hernandez in his 2007 yearbook photoA college girlfriend later revealed that Hernandez had also told her about being molested as a child, saying: \u0027He never dealt with it. It led to issues in his sexuality\u0027.  It was just one of many secrets that appeared to torture Hernandez in his short adult life, to be revealed only after he committed suicide in his jail cell in April 2017. SanSoucie himself only decided to come out to his family and friends after Hernandez\u0027s death. \u0027I really, truly feel in my heart I got the thumbs-up from him,\u0027 he said. Hernandez\u0027s shocking suicide came five days after he was acquitted of the murder of Odin Lloyd and two years after he had been sentenced to life in prison. His family later donated Hernandez\u0027s brain to Boston University, which found that the 27-year-old suffered from the most severe case of CTE ever found in a person his age.The former New England Patriots star reportedly took his own life two days after he was outed on The Kirk \u0026amp Callahan Show.            Hernandez\u0027s fiancee Shayanna Jenkins said she had no clue about his sexuality until after he killed himself           The former New England Patriots star reportedly took his own life two days after he was outed on The Kirk \u0026amp Callahan Show, which came five days after he was acquitted of murder He was called a \u0027tight end on and off the field\u0027 and a \u0027wide receiver\u0027 on the show. But, as she did throughout his murder trial and after his death, Jenkins-Hernandez remained one of his ultimate defenders. \u0027I saw no indication that he was gay or homosexual.

That is what the world wants to know.\u0027If they have got nothing to hide then they will, and should, co-operate.\u0027Saudi Arabia warned Sunday it would retaliate against any sanctions imposed on the oil-rich kingdom over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance, as the Riyadh stock market plunged on growing investor jitters."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/22/5152FC9700000578-6275551-image-a-12_1539553931912.jpg","title":"Take look inside Admiralty house regal residence Prince Harry Meghan Markle","story":"    Admiralty House in Kirribilli was built in 1842 and often plays hosts to guests of the government, including Her Majesty the Queen and other Heads of State          It is a heritage-listed building having once been the Official Residence for Royal Naval Commanders          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have arrived at Admiralty House in Sydney, the regal residence they will call home as they begin their 16-day Australian tourThe Royals touch down in Australia!

Obviously that was never going to work, so they got Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford to host it instead.I love Eamonn and Ruth, but I’m not sure if having the king and queen of daytime television commentating on your wedding is anything for a blood princess to boast about. On the snob-o-meter, it’s the equivalent of hoping for Edward and Wallis Simpson, but having to settle for Homer and Marge instead.Yet while Eamonn might not have the gravitas or presence of a vintage Dimbleby, he wasted no time in establishing hitherto unknown credentials as a millinery expert of rare refinement.‘Where’d she get those chopsticks that go through that hat?’ he wondered, when the Duchess of York first appeared in her leprechaun-themed finery. Where indeed?          Princess Eugenie of York walks down the aisle with her father, Prince Andrew the Duke of YorkThis was a minor royal wedding played in a major key, presenting our telly hosts with the dilemma of somehow finding the right tone without alienating viewers.

In the end, the couple settled on a kind of relaxed but upbeat jocularity, and it was a privilege to share their big day. Eamonn and Ruth I mean, not Eugenie and Jack. Did I say relaxed? Eamonn had the air of a man upon whom forceps were recently used to extricate him from his favourite La-Z-Boy recliner, while his darling wife appeared to have been up all night cementing her hair with max strength lacquer to combat the 40mph winds swirling around their temporary studio in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle.‘It’s a bad bride hair day,’ she said, as the most extraordinary ragbag of guests began staggering down the hill in their wedding-day best. ‘Oh, top of Kate Moss’s head there,’ said Eamonn, helpfully. ‘Holly Valance, very stylish,’ noted Ruth, as the actress wife of property tycoon Nick Candy tottered past in pink heels.

Back in the studio, Eamonn and Ruth endlessly discussed the bride’s scoliosis, in a section called Princess Eugenie’s Health Battle.Do you know something? She is not the only one to have suffered. Take Eamonn, for example. ‘I was born with my hips in the wrong place. In my whole life I could never spread my legs,’ he said.

The loose fitting dress was belted, and the star paired the look with some dance floor-ready white heels.Princess Diana wore a similar dress in 1983, but had of course accessorised with a tiara. The princess had sported the David and Elizabeth Emanuel dress at a banquet in New Zealand.Former pop princess Holly Valance stunned the crowds in an elegant pink ensemble complete with a cute pair of gloves with bow detail.This dress was similar to an outfit Diana had worn in 1983 during a visit to Maitland, New South Wales Australia. The dress had been made by designer Catherine Walker.Aside from pop royalty, fashion royalty Kate Moss also jumped on the band wagon when she arrived wearing a demure polka dot two piece. Kate ditched her usual smoky eyed look and went for a more neutral palette to attend the ceremony at St George’s chapel.

The treatment uses LED light therapy to increase collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid production, which enhances the complexion.Her skin certainly looked flawless on Friday, with a hint of her natural freckles showing through. Hannah is a fan of using Bobbi Brown’s Vitamin Enriched Face Base (£44) on her clients, while Bobbi Brown Corrector Concealer evens out skin tone.EYES To emphasise the colour of Eugenie’s blue-grey eyes, Hannah avoided black eyeliner and used brown tones, which are much softer and more flattering.

I’d expected to be among, let’s face it, be-Union-Jacked fruitcakes and a few passing Japanese tourists for this, the wedding of a radiant but minor Royal.I can’t help but laugh when the woman next to me, Sheryl Arredondo, who arrived last night from Michigan and is sporting Union Jack nail polish, tells me the presenters on ITV have been debating how to pronounce the bride’s name: ‘Is it EUgenee or EuJANEee?’No one’s ever said it much, I tell her. I’m someone who has found it hard to distinguish Eugenie from her older sister, Beatrice.‘When I told my co-workers I was coming over for the wedding, they had no idea who she was,’ Sheryl says. ‘Until I said that Fergie’s her mum.’ So why on earth has she travelled all this way? ‘I’m 66. This might be the last Royal Wedding I get the chance to see.’As more people arrive, and ooh and aah at the castle, it becomes clear the reason we’re here is to be able to say we were part of history we were there.It’s not just another society knees-up, so many people – young and old – tell me: ‘The bride is the Queen’s granddaughter.’Even if we don’t know everything about her, there’s huge affection washing around, keeping us warm: ‘Eugenie is one of the quieter ones,’ admit Julie and Malcolm, now expats in Sydney. ‘We miss all this,’ they add, taking in the pomp and the pageantry. I meet Alexis and Sol, both 20, here from the US. ‘I love the fact Eugenie has a job!’ says Alexis.  Ooze sophistication like Demi in a custom-made dress by Stella McCartneyShop the current collectionAs anticipated, the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank was a star-studded affair with attendees including Victoria Beckham, Amal Clooney and Ellie Goulding. But it was Demi Moore who won serious style points in a custom-made dress by Stella McCartney.This elegant design featured a demure neckline, short fluted sleeves, cinched waist and figure-hugging fit, which created a sophisticated aesthetic. She completed her look with Gabriela Hearst’s ‘Demi’ satin bag and a delicate headdress by Stephen Jones. The gorgeous Bordeaux shade of her ensemble couldn’t be more fitting for this season. In fact, this hue is universally flattering, so we can all try it out!

But, to my huge surprise, no one’s interested not even 25-year-olds Lewis and Sydney, here on a date. They only have eyes for the Windsors. ‘I think Kate looks tired,’ says a mum with a screaming toddler in a pushchair.As I bring up each famous face on my screen, my little group squints and grimaces. At Naomi Campbell: ‘Let’s hope no one p***es her off!’ At Cara Delevingne, who has turned up in top hat and tails: ‘Has no one told her, today isn’t all about you!’ At Ricky Martin, there’s a simple: ‘Why?’The most opprobrium comes from Rav Singh, a 57-year-old former IT worker, currently caring for his dad.

Family-of-seven must BULLDOZE brand new luxury...Share this article    The Mail on Sunday\u0027s Liz Jones with Joseph Afrane at Windsor for the Royal Wedding‘Look at David Beckham, getting out of that speeding ticket. If you’re photographed next to him, what does that say about you?’ I tell him Posh and Becks are a no-show, but that Jimmy Carr is here. ‘You see?’ he says. ‘Tax avoiders. They need to be careful. It looks like the Firm are fawning over famous people. They should stick to inviting European dignitaries, not models.’I counter that the British Royal Family has always courted the famous. Diana was friends with Elton John and Gianni Versace. Several women give me an ‘off with her head’ stare. No one is allowed to utter a bad word about Di. ‘She was always much more famous than anyone else,’ I’m told. ‘Eugenie is in danger of being eclipsed.’In fact, throughout the whole day, the only people I meet who are keen to glimpse James Blunt, say, or Robbie Williams – who turns up chewing gum! – is a group of horsey ladies, here rather noisily from the Cotswolds. ‘We went out to the farm shop where they were supposed to be uploading stars on to coaches, but we didn’t even see Ellie Goulding!’ Are they upset? ‘Nah! As long as we see Zara Phillips. We love her!’We watch the ceremony on someone else’s phone, as mine has died. As Eugenie says her vows, ‘I’m shedding a few tears,’ says a 50-year-old former PR who has dealt with her share of selfish, unruly pop stars. ‘It was so romantic and traditional. So English, with those rosy cheeks.’          MISCHIEF: Prince George and his cousin Savannah enjoying themselves at Eugenie\u0027s wedding          Prince George  reacts as he arrives with bridesmaids at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleAs the ceremony draws to a close, everyone straightens and cranes for the moment the carriage containing the couple will flash past. Don’t we think Eugenie is making a bit too much fuss, I whisper to a woman from Wales.‘Every girl dreams of a fuss. She’s spent her life being carer to her parents, she deserves today. I hope they will be happy.’ My goodness, this crowd is generous. What about the £2 million spent on the police? ‘It’s less than was spent on Trump!’When at last the carriage passes the crowd, now four-deep but as bald as William’s head in places, I’m puzzled no great cheer goes up, just a weak titter.‘That’s because we were all taking photos on our phones,’ says a misty-eyed lady.Of course, the stars had been invited, and seemed thrilled, but they will have spent considerable time over the years grooming the young princes and princesses, slicking their own events with magisterial magic. They seem to think they are ‘better’ than the Royals, and by that I don’t just mean better looking.In church, most stars’ eyes swivelled towards Demi Moore, not the Queen. Celebrities always do as they please, too (which I doubt is a luxury Meghan can now enjoy), thinking rules don’t apply to them, which is why some sneakily posted on Instagram from inside the church. Whatever happened to respect?The other wedding that took place on Friday morning was one between celebrity and Royalty. It was a marriage of convenience, one guaranteed to reap the most coverage and viewers, but where will it lead?It implies, with the positioning of the gum-smacking Robbie Williams and his wife so near the Queen, that the famous and the Royals are equal. That they belong to the same club. The one that digs up basements and annoys neighbours, lives in faux Georgian mansions, has affairs and runs out of money. This young batch of Royals (‘they are so good for PR,’ one 55-year-old woman proudly wearing a £5 Eugenie and Jack scarf tells me) have only just got the Firm back on track. Let’s not derail it now.          Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fictionThe Royal Family are different, and if they’re not, then why are we paying for them? If Euge! and Jack are no better than Posh and Becks, why should we revere them and wave to them in glass carriages? We will turn into America, where money, not history or duty, rules.I’m sure the Queen has famous friends, but I doubt they snort coke. I wonder, too, at Beatrice’s choice of reading, from The Great Gatsby. It’s a book about spoilt, rich, empty idiots who destroy everything and trample over everyone around them. That’s not the Royal Family. That’s Hollywood.Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fiction. There’s a danger the bona fide glamour of the Royals will be tarnished by this constant clamouring for the faux. They will become a chimera, as easy to erase as a Pixar cartoon.Oh, and by the way, Williams was no longer chewing when he emerged after the ceremony.

He was the pope of Francis\u0027 formative years as a young priest in Argentina and was instrumental in giving rise to the Latin American church\u0027s \u0027preferential option for the poor\u0027 that Francis has made his own.Francis also has a close personal connection to Romero, and like him lived through  right-wing military dictatorships when Francis was in Argentina. Francis was responsible for eventually declaring Romero a martyr for his fearless denunciations of the military regime at the start of El Salvador\u0027s 1980-1992 civil war.In his homily, Francis called Paul a \u0027prophet of a church turned outwards\u0027 to care for the faraway poor.

The United Nations commemorates the anniversary of his death each year.But his popularity with the left led to a decades-long delay in his saint-making cause at the Vatican, where right-wing cardinals led by Colombian Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo warned that his elevation would embolden Marxist revolutionaries.Eventually Pope Benedict XVI unblocked the cause and Francis saw it through to its conclusion Sunday.

Under his auspices, the church agreed to allow liturgy to be celebrated in the vernacular rather than in Latin and called for greater roles for the laity and improved relations with people of other faiths.Paul is also remembered for his two most important encyclicals, or teaching documents, which have had a profound effect on the church: One denounced the mounting inequality between rich and poor, and the other reaffirmed the Catholic church\u0027s opposition to artificial contraception.   Francis has also adopted the \u0027church of the poor\u0027 ethos that Paul embodied when Paul formally renounced wearing the bejeweled papal tiara.More than 1,000 Hondurans trek to the US border in \u0027March of...Woman has a SWASTIKA carved onto her stomach by supporters...Pope Francis defrocks two bishops caught in Chile\u0027s widening...Pope Francis says having an abortion is like \u0027hiring a...Kim Jong-un invites the POPE to North Korea... as it is...Pope Francis blames the DEVIL for Catholic Church\u0027s sexual...Share this articlePaul is also very important to Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, whom Paul made a cardinal in 1977.

Because he knew they were going to kill him,\u0027 added university professor Julia Lainez.For a long time, efforts to recognise Romero met with heavy opposition from conservative Catholics and the Salvadoran right, who saw veiled Marxism in his sermons.

It was a challenge Francis also took on.Romero is praised for standing up for peasant rights in the face of a right-wing backlash which painted him as a radical supporter of \u0027liberation\u0027 theology in his small, impoverished central American nation.On March 24, 1980, the man dubbed the \u0027voice of those without voice\u0027 was shot in the heart, killed by a single bullet as he prepared communion. His killing came at the start of a bloody civil war which claimed some 75,000 lives.Relics of each new saint were carried to the altar - part of a bone for Romero and the shirt Paul VI was wearing when he was stabbed in an assassination attempt at Manila airport in 1970."},{"url":null,"title":"Aaron Hernandez secret high school gay lover speaks out","story":"Dennis SanSoucie (right), Aaron Hernandez\u0027s secret gay lover from middle school and high school, is speaking out for the first time  Family members have also since revealed that Hernandez was molested as a young child.

After Kavanaugh, #HimToo gains...Share this articleMr Assange has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but believes he will be arrested if he leaves the embassy and extradited to the United States for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks.WikiLeaks said Mr Assange has not entered into any form of agreement with Ecuador to restrict his speech or other rights.His lawyers are considering his legal options and will make a statement in due course.The WikiLeaks statement said the meetings were held in Ecuador between the president and the UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi and UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression David Kaye.          He has been living inside Ecuador\u0027s embassy in London for over six years. The Ecuadorian government said in March it had acted because Mr Assange had breached \u0027a written commitment made to the government at the end of 2017 not to issue messages that might interfere with other states\u0027It said: \u0027Concern over Mr Assange\u0027s situation has also been raised by other UN bodies, as well as Human Rights Watch (who was refused access to him), Amnesty International, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, Ecuador\u0027s Permanent Human Rights Commission, and public protests\u0027Mr Assange was informed of Ecuador\u0027s decision hours after Mr Grandi and Mr Kaye met with President Moreno.\u0027President Moreno ordered Mr Assange\u0027s \u0027isolation\u0027 on March 28 in retaliation for giving \u0027opinions on the politics of friendly nations like Spain or the United States\u0027.The statement continued: \u0027Mr Assange had critically reported on the Trump administration\u0027s involvement in Yemen and Spanish police brutality. High level representations were made by the Trump administration and the Spanish government over Mr Assange, who was given political refugee status by Ecuador in 2012 over US attempts to prosecute him.\u0027The Trump administrations stepped up efforts to prosecute Mr Assange after WikiLeaks published the largest leak in the history of the CIA last year.\u0027The US has announced that it now considers Ecuador a \u0027strategic ally\u0027 and helped it secure a billion dollars in previously withheld loans.\u0027For almost seven months, Ecuador has kept Mr Assange in a regime that has been likened to solitary confinement by Human Rights Watch. Ecuador has prevented Mr Assange from receiving visitors other than his lawyers. It installed three sets of signal jammers in the embassy, to prevent Mr Assange from communicating using mobile phones or internet.\u0027The extrajudicial seven-month isolation of Mr Assange has interfered with his fundamental rights and the rights of his family. It has also prevented Mr Assange from working and giving public talks.\u0027Ecuador has also prevented all journalists from speaking to him during this time.

If you visit in mid-September, you will catch the Unseen photo festival, aimed at first-time collectors, which for many insiders is the best loved of all the fairs, known both for its intimacy and strong curatorial agenda.KrakówIn early summer, the historic Polish town of Kraków becomes the focus for a vibrant biannual photo festival, which pops up in warehouses, museums and heritage sites across the city. Founded in 2000, it combines the best opening parties, challenging exhibitions and the most rigorous talks and events programme.Photo and Offprint, ParisTop of the photo fair pecking order remains Paris Photo, hosted in the magnificent Grand Palais every November. In 48 hours, you can educate your eye and buy your first print. Just a mile away is also Offprint book fair, where serious photography bibliophiles hang out and you can discover the latest new talent.Fotomuseum Winterthur, Zurich, and Festival Images, Vevey, SwitzerlandWith its reputation for well-funded photography institutions (and some of the best photo schools in the world), Switzerland is high on the list for photography must-sees. Celebrating its 25th birthday this year, Fotomuseum Winterthur, outside Zurich, never fails to impress. On the other side of the country, in the picturesque lakeside town of Vevey, the biennial Festival Images is a dynamic open-air fair.Museum Folkwang, Essen, GermanyThe immaculate design of architect David Chipperfield’s new extension to this institution presents a flawless foil for the presentation of both historical and contemporary photographers. Also remarkable is the fact that its permanent collection is vast and has been ahead of the curve in focusing on female artists for the past 40 years.SFMOMA and Pier 24, San FranciscoIn the US, San Fran might arguably be the best place for photography at the moment. With the recent explosion of new or re-energised photo venues such as SFMOMA, where the arrival of Pompidou curator Clément Chéroux has ensured the continuation of a strong programme of shows. There is also a special opportunity to visit Pier 24, a privately funded space located on Embarcadero, which houses the Pilara Foundation’s collection. Be prepared to see shows here that are always curated in a highly original way. (Tickets must be booked ahead online.)Aipad, ICP and Aperture, New YorkOf course, the city where the first photo gallery, Alfred Steiglitz’s 291, was founded in 1905 remains a vibrant hub for photography. From Aipad (the collectors’ fair in April) to the International Center of Photography and the Aperture Foundation, there is so much on offer, with constant education programmes for those who aspire to learn more.FotoFest, HoustonWhere would we all be without FotoFest, the grandaddy of all festivals? Set up in 1983 by Wendy Watriss and Fred Baldwin, this biennial festival in March spreads its wings across the city with a range of events, exhibitions and well-respected portfolio reviews.Organ Vida, Zagreb, and Fotopub, Novo Mesto, SloveniaWith imagination and flair, Organ Vida and Fotopub parallel the recent rise in popularity of music festivals in central Europe – they both have their pulse on current debates and articulate themes in inventive ways.Lianzhou Museum of Photography, ChinaOpened in November 2017, the Lianzhou Photography Museum was designed by a young Guangzhou architectural practice, O-office, and is the first state-funded photography museum in China. Alongside handsome exhibition spaces, a lecture theatre and library, there is a core collection developed over the past decade by Duan Yuting, the organiser of the Lianzhou Foto festival, founded in 2005, which runs every November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6285fd89604b59249a28d123f7364ab458bee1d3/0_5_3059_1836/master/3059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2cc151ac5ce006facc566d3d733f170","title":"future photography in the age of instagram essay sean o hagan","story":"In our image-propelled social media era, some photographers fear for the future of the art, while others are galvanised by it. As technology increasingly shapes how we see and share the world, how is photography changing in response?In 2012, I wrote an essay about the shifting nature of photography in an era of unprecedented image overload. Back then, Facebook users alone were uploading 300m photographs a day, while the number of images posted on Flickr and Instagram had exceeded the 11bn mark. I quoted the American artist and writer Chris Wiley, whose 2011 article, “Depth of focus”, in Frieze magazine, had expressed the anxiety of many practitioners about “a world thoroughly mediatised by and glutted with the photographic image and its digital doppelganger”.Wiley’s conclusion was pessimistic: “As a result, the possibility of making a photograph that can stake a claim to originality or affect has been radically called into question. Ironically, the moment of greatest photographic plentitude has pushed photography to the point of exhaustion.”Since then, the numbers have become even more mind-boggling: 350m photographs a day uploaded on Facebook 95m photographs and videos shared on Instagram daily. The combined number of images shared uploaded on both platforms now exceeds 290bn, while there are 188m daily active users of Snapchat.Leaving aside for a moment anxieties about photography’s meaning in the social media age, one could argue from this evidence that it is the medium of our time, not just defining our globally connected digital image culture, but propelling it. Even a decade ago, no one could have predicted the seismic shift that has occurred in our relationship with – and use of – the photographic image. Back in 2012, the anxieties of many photographers tended to converge around the notion of authenticity: would digital technology undermine the craft of analogue photography and, more worryingly, its veracity? Would the invisible hand of Photoshop render not just the process, but the so-called “truth” of photography, obsolete?The arrival of the smartphone camera made all those concerns seem antiquated. It precipitated a new image culture in which photographs have assumed a fresh importance in our digitally mediated world, particularly the sharing of photographs on platforms like Instagram, where they are measured in likes, comments and repostings, all monitored by algorithms. Photography reflects, records and advertises our lives online. Is it, though, exhausting itself through its very ubiquity, losing its meaning in an age of almost unimaginable image overload?The superficial evidence would suggest otherwise. Over the past decade or so, there has been an attendant rise in interest in what you might call traditional photography culture. Although British art institutions were embarrassingly late in acknowledging the importance of photography curation – Tate appointed their first photography curator in 2009, almost 70 years after the Museum of Modern Art in New York did so – galleries are now finally according the medium the space it deserves as an art form. The new photography wing of the Victoria and Albert museum has just opened and, next spring, the Swedish organisation Fotografiska will open an 8,300 sq metre (89,000 sq ft) space in Whitechapel and another vast gallery in New York, both dedicated to contemporary photography.In the past few years, photography festivals and fairs have sprung up across the globe, challenging the commercial grandstanding of big established events such as Paris Photo and the annual Rencontres d’Arles. In September alone, Unseen Amsterdam and BredaPhoto were held in the Netherlands, Images Vevey in Switzerland, Organ Vida in Croatia and, closer to home, the Guernsey photography festival and the Brighton photo biennial. That’s more photography festivals in a month than there used to be in a year.The past few decades, too, have seen the photobook emerge as perhaps the most vibrant arbiter of photography culture. Small, independent photobook publishers proliferate pop-up events around indie photobooks and zines draw a young and informed audience. Offprint, the photography publishing fair, attracts large, mainly younger crowds annually to its book markets in Paris and London. Flying in the face of the unstoppable flow of digital images online, traditional photography culture endures and proliferates, with both the photobook and the photo archive – material things that can be handled, browsed over, collected, exchanged – assuming a heightened importance.What, though, of the photography itself? Faced with the unprecedented flow of digital images, one has to ask if the traditional status of photography as a way of documenting the world has been altered irrevocably. Whither documentary in the post-truth era? Or portraiture at a time when the selfie has reduced the traditional idea of the self-portrait to a casual narcissistic reflex (282m selfies were posted on Instagram in 2016)? And what role does reportage now play in an age when the smartphone has made us all potential citizen (photo)journalists?The last question is particularly resonant when you consider the following incident and its immediate aftermath: on 20 June 2009, 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan was shot by a pro-government sniper near the scene of a protest against the Iranian government. The Iranian state had declared the protest illegal and barred foreign media from covering it. But the image of Agha-Soltan’s blood-streaked face as she lay dying was captured on the mobile phones of those around her and, within minutes, went viral. Within hours, footage of her death posted anonymously on YouTube was viewed by the American president. In a world where we are all able to fulfil the role of bearing witness that once fell to photojournalists how can traditional reportage compete?The anxieties that Wiley identified converge around not just the status, but the meaning, of photography in a digital world drowning in images. As I noted in 2012, though, “No amount of camera technology will turn a mediocre photographer into a great one, nor, in conceptual terms, will it transform a bad idea into a good one. For that, you would still need to possess a rare set of creative gifts that are to do with seeing, with deep looking.” I wonder now if that is still the case. Perhaps our relationship with the photographic print – for so long the standard of excellence and artistry – is changing in a world where so many images float unmoored from their context.As if to illustrate this, one of the most arresting pieces of work I saw last year was an installation by the Indian photographer Sohrab Hura, The Lost Head and the Bird, shown on a sped-up projection in a darkened, semi-derelict space in Peckham. It was a dramatic merging of the real and the possibly fictional, a stream of visceral images of life on the margins in India that had an almost hallucinatory intensity. Here, all the tired tropes of street photography were upended into a visual stream of almost subliminal images that jolted the viewer – the traditional, reformatted and revitalised.In contrast, another noteworthy series I first saw last year was Ex-Voto by English photographer Alys Tomlinson, which comprises black and white portraits and landscapes of contemporary pilgrims and holy sites in France, Poland and Ireland. (It has since won Tomlinson the 2018 Sony world photography award.) Using film, her work draws on the austere portraiture of August Sander and the human otherness captured by Diane Arbus. In its still, spartan style, it is the perfect merging of form and subject, reaffirming a tradition of craft and attentiveness.Increasingly, though, contemporary photography is all about, to borrow a term beloved by academics and curators, “interrogating the medium”, which often means shifting it away from documentary towards other, more conceptually driven art forms – abstract painting, sculpture, performance, video installation. To this end, younger photographers such as Daisuke Yokota and Maya Rochat, both included in Tate Modern’s recent exhibition, Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art, make work that is, on one level, a dynamic reflection of the dilemma of the contemporary photographer in an age of image overload. Yokota, for instance, has treated images with heat and iron powder, and subjected others to constant rephotographing, rescanning and reprinting. The results are closer to abstraction and make the idea of photography as a medium that simply records the world around us seem positively quaint.A glance at the range of processes that underpin contemporary photography practice attests to the fact that the medium is now performance, sculpture, abstraction, deconstruction and diary as much as it is documentary. None of this is entirely new.It is worth remembering, too, that although our contemporary image culture is without precedent in terms of its scale and its endless flow, there was another moment when technology sparked a surge in vernacular image-making. Back in the early 1960s, advances in analogue photographic technology brought the almost-instant photograph into the hands of millions of amateur American snappers through the Polaroid camera. In 1960, sales had reached 100m a year. By 1964, 5m Polaroid cameras had been produced. The proliferation of Polaroid snapshots marked the first wave of democratic photography, but it did not, as far as I know, induce collective anxiety in a transformative generation of photographers – including Arbus and Garry Winogrand – who were coming of age back then.What the Polaroid did do, though, was inform the image-making of an ensuing generation, underpinning the snapshot aesthetic of both Stephen Shore and William Eggleston, whereby the apparently mundane and casual was actually formally rigorous and deeply observed. Andy Warhol, too, instinctively understood the democratic power of the Polaroid, as his photographic portraits attest. For him, the medium – Polaroids of his celebrity friends or himself – was very much the message, not just elevating and celebrating the wondrous banality of everyday America in all its superficial glamour, but encapsulating it. Perhaps it is worth looking at the smartphone camera – and social media – in this way: how will they influence a generation of image-makers to come?Although certain influential photographers such as Eggleston and Shore had always insisted on the essentially democratic nature of their approach, the smartphone camera has already made photography democratic in a way that no one could have predicted. It placed compact, ultra hi-tech, relatively cheap image-making machinery in the hands of the many, not the few. What they did with it has already revolutionised not just the way we use photography, but the way we see – and share – the world around us.The diaristic nature of Instagram seems crucial here, allowing photographers to try out ideas, document work in progress or simply alert people to what they are up to in terms of book publishing, exhibitions or talks. Interestingly, though, the younger American documentary photographer Alec Soth is less enthusiastic about using Instagram as a platform for his work. “When Instagram started, I was opposed to using it,” he says. “I was a fan of Tumblr – I found it more flexible and open and less prone to the ‘like’ neediness of Instagram. I also disliked the filters which, in the beginning, were the big draw to the platform.”Soth admits that Instagram can be a creative tool – “a place for me to experiment with an audience” – but fears that “a lot of the time it’s not much more than a branding tool”. He is suspicious, too, of its effect on our understanding or appreciation of photography. “I don’t think I have ever been moved the way I have with a great artwork, film or novel. Instead, the platform gives me little pellets of pleasure. I guess that’s what I dislike about it too – the addictive quality of those pellets rarely satisfies.”For all that, I have found Instagram to be a fertile ground for discovery. Among my favourite feeds are Simone White (@simonewhitemusic) who creates beautiful still lifes in natural light, the vernacular photography collection of Billy Parrott (@billyparrott), the extraordinary Japanese photobook collection @solitudeofravens, and @spacearchives, a feed about public art environments.Among more established artists, Cindy Sherman is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a trailblazer, using Instagram brilliantly as an extension of her practice.Joan Didion once declared: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” Instagram is also, of course, a way of telling stories – or creating narrative – about ourselves. Of late, contemporary photography has become a nexus for visual storytelling of an often stylised, metaphorical or semi-fictional nature.In 2014, Argentinian artist Amalia Ulman created an Instagram feed as a work of art in itself, creating a fictional persona as a Los Angeles “it girl”, and living it out for three months by posing for selfies in trendy restaurants, designer shops, international airports and luxury hotel lobbies. Having identified three social media archetypes of privileged femininity – “cute girl”, “sugar babe” and “life goddess” – she photographed herself in lingerie, at pole-dancing classes, and dining out with a tiny, cute designer dog on her lap. Ulman’s project inevitably precipitated a wave of online anger and outrage when she revealed that she was an artist. Her work was not just a critique of social media archetypes of glamour and success, but an exploration of how easily “followers” can be mesmerised and manipulated by the same. At its heart, too, was a complex dynamic: how photography can lie to expose a deeper truth.The following year, life inevitably imitated art, when the media reported that Instagram star Essena O’Neill, an Australian teenager with half a million followers, had deleted her account. She described it as “a contrived perfection made to get attention”. She pointed to posed selfies that helped her make an income from marketing products to her followers, and spoke of the all-consuming nature of a life lived on – and in thrall – to social media. Her posed selfies – so staged as to seem obviously performative – nevertheless mesmerised her followers to the point where even the most blatant product placement seemed invisible, or simply acceptable. Again, she, like Ulman, was castigated by those she had seemingly betrayed. The power of photography as a tool of fantasy andor mass delusion is not new – the advertising industry was built on it – but now seems so powerful and so prevalent as to be disturbing.Next month, the Photographers’ Gallery in London hosts an exhibition titled, All I Know Is What’s on the Internet. It will feature the “contemporary artists seeking to map, visualise and question the cultural dynamics of 21st-century photography” in a social media age. To this end, it will “interrogate” not just the role and agency of the photographer in this new context, but “photography’s cultural value… at a time when the boundaries between truth and fiction, machine and human are being increasingly called into question”.It will include work by the intriguingly named Constant Dullaart, whose 2014 project, High Retention, Slow Delivery, targeted what he called “the contemporary attention economy” of Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the “sharing mechanisms” of which – likes, retweets, followers, friends – stimulate “an appreciation system based on popularity over quality, and social skills over talent”.Dullaart’s work centres on what he calls “the capitalisation of community”. In all of this, Wiley’s anxiety about the creation of a new photograph “that can stake a claim to originality or affect” remains resonant. But it also sparks an attendant question, which is not so much what social media is doing to photography, but what an image-propelled social media culture is doing to us? Where is our agency in a world so dominated and driven by digital technology, so controlled by global corporations and invisible algorithms?In February this year, researchers from Alphabet Inc’s DeepMind ision released thumbnail images of a range of everyday subjects: a dog, a butterfly, a hamburger and an ocean view. All were AI-generated images produced from scratch by an algorithm called BiGAN. All look disturbingly like real photographs. Sooner than we think, it will be impossible for the human eye to tell the difference between an AI-generated image and a real photograph. The future is already here and photography is the medium shaping it – and us – in ways that make all these anxieties about the meaning of photography seem almost irrelevant. And, in another way – against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts, and artificial intelligence – more relevant than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64e3c57d85368a5290e26abbc38b16da0c2ad1f7/0_259_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc113dcac2bd29f2a9c905f4e085c4e4","title":"british brutalist buildings in pictures","story":"The postwar years, says photographer Rob Clayton, were a unique period for architecture in Britain.

I wish I’d done more of that. We all wish we’d had more time,” he said. “I was going to write a play about my parents. I didn’t write that.”One of Curtis’s biggest television hits was Blackadder, which he created with Rowan Atkinson and co-wrote, from series two onwards, with Ben Elton.The prospects of a fifth Blackadder series are zero, he suggested. “Blackadder is a very complicated group of people. So if you’re fond enough of the series to wish that the people involved in it should live to a ripe old age then I think it’s best that we don’t work together,” he said.Curtis will be 64 in two years’ time and he told an audience at the Cheltenham literature festival: “I’m retiring on my birthday in 2020.” He added, presumably joking: “And I’m hoping to take up drugs.”He was being interviewed on stage by his daughter Scarlett Curtis, the feminist activist and editor of the book Feminists Don’t Wear Pink (and other Lies). “I’ve been trying to get Scarlett to take up drugs and drink for so long, but she said she’d only do it if she followed my example.”The event was unusual in that Curtis had no new book to plug. Instead he reflected on his life and dual career in entertainment and charity. He was also unashamed about making feel-good entertainment. That had been a conscious choice, he said.“I did feel that in order to deal with the harsh things that had happened to me, and the things that I see around me, I would do the Comic Relief work for that. There is a job to be done making people joyful, happy and reminding people of the amazing wonder of our world.”He said Love, Actually had been criticised as unrealistic. If he had made a movie about a man kidnapping a woman and chaining her to a radiator for five years it would be judged “searingly realistic”. But more people are in love, not chaining people to radiators, Curtis said.“We are lucky we live in a country and a world where there is enormous amounts of love and happiness and it’s worth writing that.”He said it was interesting to speculate about which fictional romantic couples would stay together. He recalled once reviewing movies to work it out and decided it would be the couple in Brief Encounter, “who were already very unhappy. They would stay unhappy.”“I did once work out that I had written 3,000 pages to reach Notting Hill, which was a 120-page script.”The editing of a movie could also save it, he said, recalling his experience with Bridget Jones’s Diary, which did “not work at all” until they moved the penultimate scene to the beginning, the scene  with Bridget in her red pyjamas in despair drinking and crying. It became the title scene so you felt for the character from the start. “There are miraculous things which can happen in the edit,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22be41e9b61e70a8a9ad755d6b3b359294570eb9/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea1c91896929b6b113be1887f165aca","title":"uk scientists turn coffee waste electricity fuel cell colombia","story":"Fuel cell could help Colombian farmers by using microbes to eat waste and develop energyScientists have turned coffee waste into electricity for the first time, in research that could help farmers and curb pollution in the developing world.The coffee industry generates a huge amount of liquid waste during the process of turning the raw material of the tree – the coffee cherries – into the 9.5m tons of coffee the world produces each year.Wastewater is generated by farms during the washing of coffee seeds, or beans, and during the water-intensive process of making instant coffee. But now a UK-funded programme, working with Colombian researchers, has proven that it can not only remove the contaminants from the water but make electricity in the process.A team led by the University of Surrey developed a fuel cell that uses microbes instead of chemicals like a fuel cell in a hydrogen car, which eat the waste matter and generate a small amount of energy.Dr Claudio Avignone Rossa, a systems microbiologist at the university, said: “You’re not going to light up London with these things, but you’re going to put a light where there was none.“The farmer will be getting a little bit of energy coming from the waste they are throwing away. So the environment will be cleaner. The finances of the farm will be improved.”While coffee waste has been used as biofuel before, and compacted to be sold as “biologs” to be burned, the project is believed to be the first to produce electricity from such waste.Claire Perry, energy minister, hailed the work as an example of the UK’s expertise in the green economy. “Your morning latte could start its life on a remote Colombian coffee farm and now, thanks to UK-government funded research, those farms now have grounds to double up as producers of both coffee beans and electricity,” she said.The microbes that convert the coffee waste were of the sort that occur in sludge from wastewater treatment plants, but Avignone Rossa said they could also be found on Colombian farms. “Supply is not a problem,” he added.The microbial fuel cells made by the researchers are roughly the size of a fizzy drink can. While the lab versions were made of Perspex and stainless steel and cost £300-£500, the team also produced ones for less than £2 using materials like ceramics and disposable plastic boxes.Avignone Rossa said he was waiting on responses from funding agencies for money to build a prototype in the field in Colombia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c4ca5a225119396b5b180fc4918e654b48ee28/0_288_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cccc390eccc69df2bb669f4a71504a5","title":"weaker buy to let market hope first time buyers landlord survey","story":"Price of small properties has fallen and landlord purchases are down, surveys showFurther evidence that the crackdown on buy-to-let investors has had the desired effect, thus giving hope to first-time buyers, has come from two surveys.First-time buyers are now paying an average of £190,000 for their home, compared with £307,000 across the whole market, it saidMarkets in London and the north-east are currently the most sluggish, according to Rightmove.

Talking of China, it’s worth revisiting comments by the country’s central bank governor at the close of the IMF meeting in Bali on Sunday.Yi Gang said China still had plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the face of any negative impact from trade tensions with the United States.He admitted China faced “tremendous uncertainties” but was seeking a “constructive solution” to the current trade tensions. “We still have plenty of monetary policy instruments in terms of interest rate policy, in terms of RRR. We have plenty of room for adjustment, just in case we need it,” Yi said, indicating that Beijing feels it has plenty of ammunition to fire up the economy if needed.Chris Weston of Pepperstone in Melbourne has weighed with some commentary, saying things could quite ugly on stock markets if data out of China – inflation, GDP and retail sales – disappoints later in the week.Here are the latest scores, courtesy of IC Markets (although I think they’ve missed the minus sign off the Hang Seng price):Summing up nicely, Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities says: “We can’t say the shock is over.”The key issue is how to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU wants the North to remain essentially bound by EU customs rules but that is facing pushback from Brexiters. Theresa May is hoping a temporary “backstop” can be put in place where the whole country remains in the customs deal for the time being.(There’s a good explainer here from Daniel Boffey, or Brussels correspondent.)Meanwhile, former foreign secretary and would-be Tory leader, Boris Johnson, has sounded off again in his  column. He says the backstop idea should be rejected completely and says the EU is treating the UK “with contempt”:In presuming to change the constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom, the EU is treating us with naked contempt. Like some chess player triumphantly forking our king and our queen, the EU commission is offering the UK government what appears to be a binary choice. It is a choice between the break-up of this country, or the subjugation of this country, between separation or submission. So seems like a good moment to run this brilliant picture of UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and other foreign ministers in the maze at his country retreat Chevening this weekend. Still with Australia and interesting to note that Shane Oliver, the high-profile chief economist at AMP, has suggested that he might have to revise downwards his forecasts on house prices.The Chinese trading day has kicked off.Another major factor in stock market losses this week has been the prospect of a full-blown US-China trade war. But calls for calm from leaders gathered at the IMF conference in Bali last week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. The Chinese currency fell again against the dollar today. It’s now at 6.92. That is sure to rattle Washington where there is a widespread view that beijing manipulates the currency to benefit exporters.In Sunday’s IMF communique, members agreed to debate ways to improve the World Trade Organization so it can better address trade disputes and that countries would “refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes”. The latter point address concern that China will allow the yuan to depreciate in order to make its exports more competitive to cope with any downside from US tariffs. Hmm ...While the Ssudi government has come out fighting on the prospect of US sanctions in the Khashoggi case, the boss of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network has gone a few steps further.Turki Aldakhil paints an apocalyptic picture of world affairs if the US tries to get tough on the Saudis. He says the kingdom would respond by slashing oil output and would team up with Russia and stop buying US arms. The US would be “stabbing itself to death”.Imposing any type of sanctions on Saudi Arabia by the West will cause the kingdom to resort to other options, US President Donald Trump had said a few days ago, and that Russia and China are ready to fulfill Riyadh’s military needs among others. No one can deny that repercussions of these sanctions will include a Russian military base in Tabuk, northwest of Saudi Arabia, in the heated four corners of Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Iraq.At a time where Hamas and Hezbollah have turned from enemies into friends, getting this close to Russia will lead to a closeness to Iran and maybe even a reconciliation with it.The list of marquee speakers at the Future Investment Intiative conference in Saudi Arabia next week makes interesting reading because a few of them have now said they will not be going.Jamie Dimon has pulled out along with the boss of Uber and the editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton-Beddoes, while US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is under pressure not to go. Watch this space for more. The rise in oil prices is gathering pace too.

People that know a lot about this stuff, is there anything to be potentially optimistic about? I think this week I feel even worse than Nov 2016 and I’m really trying to find some hope here.”A bunch of her friends posted variations on “we’re doomed” and “it’s hopeless,” which perhaps made them feel that they were in charge of one thing in this overwhelming situation, the facts. They weren’t, of course. They were letting understandable grief at the news morph into an assumption that they know just how the future is going to turn out. They don’t.The future hasn’t already been decided. That is, climate change is an inescapable present and future reality, but the point of the IPCC report is that there is still a chance to seize the best-case scenario rather than surrender to the worst. Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in a gulag for his work with Soviet dissident Andrei Sarkovsky, recalls his mentor saying, “They want us to believe there’s no chance of success. But whether or not there’s hope for change is not the question. If you want to be a free person, you don’t stand up for human rights because it will work, but because it is right. We must continue living as decent people.” Right now living as decent people means every one of us with resources taking serious climate action, or stepping up what we’re already doing.Taking action is the best way to live in conditions of crisis and violation, for your spirit and your conscience as well as for society. It’s entirely compatible with grief and horror you can work to elect climate heroes while being sad. There are no guarantees – but just as Sakharov and Sharansky probably didn’t imagine that the Soviet Union would dissolve itself in the early 1990s, so we can anticipate that we don’t exactly know what will happen and how our actions will help shape the future.The histories of change that have made me hopeful are often about small groups that seem at the outset unrealistic in their ambition. Whether they were taking on slavery in antebellum USA or human rights in the Soviet bloc, these movements grew exponentially and changed consciousness and then toppled institutions or regimes. We also don’t know what technological breakthroughs, large-scale social changes, or catastrophic ecological feedback loops will shape the next 20 years. Knowing that we don’t know isn’t grounds for confidence, but it is fuel against despair, which is a form of certainty. This future is as uncertain as it’s ever been.The movement that has taken on pipelines and fuel trains, refineries and shipping terminals, fracking and mountaintop removal, estment and finance, policy and law, and sometimes won is evidence of what can happen in 12 years. Some of what were regarded as climate activists’ wild ideas and unreasonable demands are now policy and conventional common sense. There are so many transformative projects under way from local work to transition off fossil fuels, to the effort to stop pipelines (with some major victories, including the one to stop the Trans-Mountain pipeline, which won in court in late August), to the lawsuit against the US government on behalf of 21 young people, charging it with violating their rights and the public trust. The trial begins on 29 October in Eugene, Oregon.The other thing I find most encouraging and even a little awe-inspiring is how profoundly the global energy landscape has already changed in this century. At the beginning of the 21st century, renewables were expensive, inefficient, infant technologies incapable of meeting our energy needs. In a revolution at least as profound as the industrial revolution, wind and solar engineering and manufacturing have changed everything we now have the technological capacity to largely leave fossil fuel behind. It was not possible then it is now. That is stunning. And encouraging.The IPCC report recommends urgent work on many fronts – from how we produce food and to what use we put land (more forests) to how we generate and use energy (and the unsexy business of energy efficiency also matters). It describes four paths forward, three of which depend on carbon-capturing technologies not yet realized, the fourth includes the most radical reductions in fossil-fuel use and planting a lot of trees.The major obstacles to this withdrawal are political, the fossil fuel and energy corporations and the governments obscenely intertwined with them. I called up Steve Kretzmann, the longtime director of the climate policy-and-action group Oil Change International (on whose board I sit), and he reflected on the two approaches to climate action – changing consumption and changing production.Going after production often gets neglected, and places like Alberta, Canada, like to boast about their virtuous energy consumption projects while their energy production – in Alberta’s case, the tar sands – threatens the future of the planet. Addressing production means going after some of the most powerful and ruthless corporations on earth and the regimes that protect them and are rewarded by them – or, as with Russia and Saudi Arabia and to some extent the US are indistinguishable from them.Five countries – Belize, Ireland, New Zealand, France and Costa Rica – are already working on bans on new exploration and extractionSteve told me, “We have to be real about this: this is the oil industry and wars are fought over it. There’s a lot of political power here and there’s a lot of people defending that power.” But he also noted, “The moment it’s clear it’s inexorably on the wane, it will pop.” You can hasten the popping by cutting the enormous subsidies, and by esting from fossil fuel corporations – to date the once-mocked estment movement has gotten $6tn withdrawn. As Damien Carrington reported for the  last month, “Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited estment as a material risk to its business.”We also need to shut down production directly, with a just transition for workers in those sectors. Five countries – Belize, Ireland, New Zealand, France and Costa Rica – are already working on bans on new exploration and extraction, and the World Bank sent shockwaves around the world last December when it announced that after 2019 it would no longer finance oil and gas extraction.Given that the clean energy comes with lots of jobs – and jobs that don’t give people black lung and don’t poison surrounding communities – there’s a lot of ancillary benefit. Fossil fuel is, even aside from the carbon it pumps into the atmosphere, literally poison, from the mercury that contaminates the air when coal is burned and the mountains of coal ash residue to the toxic emissions and water contamination of fracking and the sinister chemicals emitted by refineries to the smog from cars. “Giving up” is often how fossil fuel is talked about, as though it’s pure loss, but renouncing poison doesn’t have to be framed as sacrifice.Part of the work we need to do is to imagine not only the devastation of climate change, and the immense difference between 2 or 3 degrees of warming and 1.5 degrees, but the benefits of making a transition from fossil fuel. The fading away of the malevolent power of the oil companies would be a profound transformation, politically as well as ecologically.I don’t know exactly if or how we’ll get to where we need to go, but I know that we must set out better options with all the passion, power and intelligence we have. A revolution is what we need, and we can begin by imagining and demanding it and doing what we can to try to realize it. Rather than waiting to see what happens, we can be what happens. And by the way, the comedian I mentioned: she’s already organizing fundraisers for climate groups."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e74a0a8fc515f6b65ca1a55c35281a05d2537db/0_12_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc05e16acc921a7c1d9e827e393fa3eb","title":"sensitive images upsetting photos essential truthful account","story":"Khalid Masood was lawfully shot dead by police after he killed five people at Westminster in March 2017, a coroner’s inquest in London concluded on Friday. Over several days of covering the hearing,  editors had access to a limited range of images of Masood. For one report they used a photo of him taken in the Great Mosque of Mecca, Islam’s holiest site.Some Muslim readers expressed to me concern that the image linked a particularly important aspect of their religion to the awful crimes of this inidual. One of the five pillars of Islam is for Muslims, if physically and financially capable, to make the Hajj, a pilgrimage to the site, at least once in their lifetime.From an editorial standards perspective, there was nothing wrong with the image. Legitimately obtained, it depicted a smiling Masood dressed in the traditional white, and behind him the Kaaba, the great cube, around which pilgrims walk seven times.Conscious that the Muslim community can suffer discrimination when terrorist acts are committed in the name of a political ideology that feigns religiosity, as a gesture of goodwill the editors replaced the photo for another image, a police mugshot. Muslims who had raised the issue were appreciative.It is essential that journalists cover the crimes that constitute terrorism, and the legal processes which follow. Coverage can justifiably include images of perpetrators but should take care not to glorify them. Had the photo related directly to evidence given in the inquest it might have been necessary to retain it.A different case of image sensitivity arose from an online gallery of 29 photographs taken at Tarragona, Spain, where teams compete to form the highest and most complex tower of interlinked humans. A feature of Catalan culture, the “castellers” demonstrate great feats of strength, balance and daring but most of all, it seems to me, of trust and unity. The towers collapse at times, and one image online shows the aftermath. The camera looks down from above at a man lying on his back surrounded by team-mates. The beautifully composed image evokes El Greco. A plea arrived by email in my office. The writer, who seemed close to the event, said the man had been unconscious. The message was ambiguous about whether he had later died. It respectfully requested that the image be deleted in recognition of grief, privacy and “the integrity of the injured person”.Depictions of distressed, seriously injured or dead persons need to be handled with care. The editors checked with the suppliers of the images and learned that the man had regained consciousness and was recovering from a shoulder injury.I agree with the editors’ decision to keep the image online. It is one part of a public cultural event in which danger and injury are elements of a truthful account. The reader took the explanation in good heart.Reasonable people can differ on these kinds of calls, but in my time in this role I have been consistently impressed by the willingness of  editors to consider, reconsider and explain their decisions.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f1fbfbb78a07c0ab23651d0f7652cfb6b4ef1d/0_146_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62759265bfdca10c778c2d3e34e3dc9f","title":"theresa may deal eu dup cabinet","story":"Even if May reaches an agreement with the EU, she faces a backlash from the DUP, and possibly her cabinetNever underestimate David Davis. Dismissed by many socially grander Tories, he remains defiantly at the heart of the action. Often attacked as an incompetent Brexit secretary, he was, for instance, one of the first cabinet ministers to grasp the need for significant exemptions to the new immigration rules if the British economy were to stay afloat.Most tellingly it was Davis, rather than Boris Johnson, who resigned first over the Chequers deal. While the foreign secretary (as Johnson still was) lingered in the dressing room, preparing for his grand stage entrance, his cabinet colleague got on with it and did the deed. You don’t have to share Davis’s views on Brexit (and I don’t) to see that, of the two, he behaved more honourably.Johnson is now reportedly furious that Davis is considering another run at the Conservative leadership (he was defeated by David Cameron in 2005). But – again – it is Davis who, writing in the Sunday Times, has taken the initiative and called on his former cabinet colleagues “to exert their collective authority”. At this week’s EU summit in Brussels, he continues, “the authority of our constitution is on the line”.Three such ministers – Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt – are known to be considering their respective positions. For Mordaunt, in particular, it is a difficult call: the international development secretary’s political stock has soared in recent months. She is that most rare phenomenon – a modernising Brexiteer, as likely to be championing trans rights as defending the result of the 2016 EU referendum. Does she broaden her appeal to pro-Brexit MPs and Tory members by quitting over a prospective deal that is very unlikely to please her (or them)? Or does she, like Michael Gove, stay at the top table and bide her time?There is a gathering rebellion on the Tory backbenches over May’s proposals for EU departure: 63 Conservative MPs have signed a letter to Philip Hammond, complaining about leaked Whitehall forecasts of the adverse impact Brexit will have upon Britain’s GDP. But the principal objection the leavers have to the prime minister’s plan is its provision for a “backstop” mechanism that would keep the UK in the EU customs union until the Irish border question is resolved.Meanwhile, and no less significantly, it has emerged that Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, believes a “no-deal” Brexit is the most probable outcome of the talks. What Foster opposes most vigorously is the proposition that, to avoid a hard border on the island, Northern Ireland should stay in the EU single market as well as the customs union – leading to what she calls its “permanent annexation away from the rest of the UK”.It is powerfully clear that the DUP’s readiness to prop up the Tory minority government is being tested to the limit. Indeed, Hammond’s budget on 29 October may yet be the occasion of the government’s fall. Foster has made it unambiguously clear that May and the chancellor cannot take her party’s support for granted if the contours of Brexit prove to be as “dodgy” as she suspects.Time is one of the most powerful forces in politics: habituation breeds consent, or at least weary acquiescence. And it is time that Brexiteer MPs and the DUP fear. Rebellious Tory backbenchers fret that Brussels will contrive to keep the UK in the customs union, and that a notionally temporary arrangement will become, in reality, a permanent one. Foster’s Unionists see a more elemental danger on the horizon: namely that Northern Ireland, detached from the UK and still in the single market, will slowly become, in practice, part of a mostly unified Ireland. And this much is true: what is agreed in 2018 will look very different in 2028. Time will have its way.Which is why we are entering the most constitutionally tense period in British history since the second world war. In spite of premature reports in the German press, it is unlikely that this week’s European council summit will settle the terms of Brexit. But both sides have higher hopes for the additional meeting pencilled in for mid-November.If May returns brandishing an agreement next month, she will face a moment of profound paradox: having achieved a historic deal, she may be rewarded by political annihilation. Under section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, parliament is entitled to a meaningful vote on the outcome of the negotiations. If MPs reject that deal, the government has 21 days to make a fresh statement to the Commons about its intentions. Next, the prime minister has until 21 January to present an amended agreement. And after that? Well, then things start to get really vague.With each passing day, the shining palace that leave promised us in 2016 looks more and more like a dilapidated Victorian folly. Hectically, crazily, the nation is careering towards the unknown. I’d say it could go either way – if it were remotely clear what those ways might be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f1fac441d768d3fef2caa1f9a13560a8434f3d/0_180_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d93b2483c2adc0de74a0729aa163caf","title":"we can rebuild economy foundations up","story":"The late Prof Mick Moran, who taught politics and government at Manchester University for most of his professional life, had, according to his colleagues, once had “a certain residual respect for our governing elites”. That all changed during the 2008 financial crisis, after which he experienced an epiphany “because it convinced him that the officer class in business and in politics did not know what it was doing”.After his epiphany, Moran formed a collective of academics dedicated to exposing the complacency of finance-worship and to replacing it with an idea of running modern economies focused on maximising social good. They called themselves the Foundational Economy Collective, based on the idea that it’s in the everyday economy where there is most potential for true social regeneration: not top-down cash-splashing, but renewal and replenishment from the ground upwards.Foundational activities are the materials and services without which we cannot live a civilised life: clean, unrationed water affordable electricity and gas without cuts to supply collective transport on smooth roads and rails quality health and social care provided free at the point of use and reliable, sustainable food supply. Then there’s the “overlooked economy” – everyday services such as hairdressing, veterinary care, catering and hospitality and small-scale manufacturing – which employ far more people, across a wider geographical range, than the “high-skill, hi-tech” economy with which recent governments have been obsessed.For the Foundational Economy authors, focusing on the fundamental value of invisible and unglamorous jobs “restores the importance of unappreciated and unacknowledged tacit skills of many citizens”. It’s a way of looking at economics from the point of view of people rather than figures, and doing something revolutionary (yet so blindingly obvious) in the process. What is the point of “growth” if the basic elements of a decent life are denied to a large and growing number?Because everybody has these everyday needs, their provision is not – or ought not to be – specific to one or a few regions, and is comparatively resistant to automation. If applied by government as a central plank of industrial strategy, prioritising the foundational economy could fundamentally transform people’s quality of life outside London and the south-east – which would be the direct opposite of the dire “northern powerhouse” template that has only created even more cynicism.Visions of an economy run for social good, rather than inidual gain, are being developed by Labour through a series of regional workshops on the “new economics”. As the examples of Preston, Enfield and Oldham councils have shown, it hurts nobody to bring services back into local authority control and to est from the outsourcing firms whose own definition of “growth”’ is extracting profit from social misery.A change in thinking is urgently required to bring about a permanent and ongoing renewal of the foundations of a good society.This brings to mind a long-buried yet prescient quote by Raymond Williams. In his 1960 novel Border Country, he describes a character witnessing “a slow and shocking cancellation of the future” in the wake of the 1926 general strike. This quote has been leapt upon in recent years by a reinvigorated and youthful left.It’s as though, nearly 60 years later, we’ve woken up to the idea that a better future can be reinstated, but that we have to get it back ourselves. Restoring decent basic services for everyone, then keeping the bar high for everyone, is a task akin to painting and repainting the Forth Bridge, and this alone is enough to keep millions of people in stable, valuable work.For a future better than the one we’re dreading, we need to start rebuilding the foundations now. • Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6259393982d84513f59f439c232fc01a8b376128/0_0_620_224/master/620.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b90b5ba8d2f3e08115f117f71eedde28 685w","title":"nigel slater drop scones recipes","story":"These easy old-fashioned comfort food classics are guaranteed to make your kitchen cosierThe kitchen roof has been letting in water for some time now, and repairs need to begin before winter sets in. I particularly appreciate the long, thin room – more of a galley, really – when the rain beats down on the skylights or a layer of snow sits on the glass, muffling both sound and light. It is then, with a cake in the oven or a deep pan of thickening polenta on the stove, that the kitchen is at its most cosy.It takes surprisingly little activity to turn a cold, leaky kitchen into a warm and welcoming space. You make a bowl of batter with flour, egg and milk, ladle little pools on to a hot pan, and in 5 minutes you have a batch of warm drop scones. It’s the sort of baking no one does any more but probably should. Traditionally they are spread with deep waves of clotted cream and rivulets of runny jam, but I prefer to add a handful of berries, so their juice stains the doughy cakes with streaks of purple.Making drop scones the other day, it occurred to me that I could tweak the recipe towards something savoury by ditching the sugar and introducing a punchy cheese. We ate the result, as homely as cheese on toast, for Sunday supper alongside a frying pan full of pumpkin hash with onion and rosemary. Suddenly the damp patches on the ceiling seemed a little less urgent. Injured it may be, but the kitchen is still doing what it does best.I use smoked bacon here, but pancetta will be fine, too, as would finer, air-dried prosciutto or even salami, finely chopped.Fry the bacon in a shallow pan until crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. Alternatively grill the bacon in a griddle pan or overhead grill until crisp. Leave to cool. Finely chop the parsley. When the bacon is cool, chop into small pieces, about the size of fine gravel.Put the flour in a large mixing bowl, add the baking powder and combine. (You can sieve the two together if you wish.) Break the egg into a bowl and beat lightly with a fork to combine white and yolks, and mix in the milk, then fold into the flour.Add the grated parmesan to the batter, then stir in the bacon and the parsley.Melt the butter in a small saucepan then remove from the heat. In a small, non-stick or well-used frying pan, pour a couple of tablespoons of the melted butter and let it warm over a moderate heat. Pour in a sixth of the bacon and parmesan batter, making a round approximately the size of a digestive biscuit. Repeat with 2 more then let them cook for 4-5 minutes, checking the undersides regularly for colour. When golden, use a palette knife to carefully turn each one over. Leave for a further 3-4 minutes then lift out and keep warm. A sound test for doneness is to touch the centre of each scone with your finger. It should feel lightly springy. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Serve the scones warm, with the pumpkin below.The endlessly useful and easily transported butternut can be used here if carrying an entire pumpkin home doesn’t appeal.Enough for 6Peel the pumpkin and cut the flesh into cubes roughly 3cm x 3cm. Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm the butter and olive oil in a shallow pan, add the pumpkin and onions and let them cook, with a regular stir, for about 10 minutes. Chop the rosemary, add to the pan with a little salt and black pepper, then cover with a lid and leave to cook over a low to moderate heat for about 15 minutes.Check the mixture occasionally to make sure it isn’t browning too much. It is done when the pumpkin is soft and easy to crush between your fingers. Serve with the bacon drop scones (above).Most berries lend themselves to inclusion in a drop scone. Elderberries and blackcurrants can used from the freezer.self-raising flour 180gbaking powder 1 tspcaster sugar 1 tbspegg 1, large milk 220mlbutter a littleblackcurrants, blackberries or blueberries 100gMix the flour, baking powder and sugar in a large mixing bowl.

Pour in a sixth of the batter, letting it form a round about the size of a digestive biscuit. Repeat with 2 more then leave for 4-5 minutes, checking the undersides as you go. It should never be more than pale gold. When done, turn the scones using a palette knife. Leave for a further 3-4 minutes then remove from the pan, check they are lightly springy to the touch, and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining mixture.

Coming into Sunday’s Concacaf Women’s Tournament semi-final against Jamaica, the players and coach Jill Ellis were keenly aware of what happened in 2010, admitting they talked about it before the tournament started.But this time around, there was no such suspense for the No1-ranked team in the world. On Sunday, the Americans steamrolled their way past Jamaica, 6-0, and clinched their spot at the 2019 Women’s World Cup, giving them the chance to defend their title.“Now, how we’re clicking at this moment, is a special time for us,” said Tobin Heath after the game. “Qualifying is a great feeling and qualifying in this way is even better.”It took the Americans just 103 seconds to score. Lindsey Horan fired a shot that Jamaica goalkeeper Sydney Schneider palmed away, but Heath collected the rebound for the tap-in.It took another 13 minutes for Megan Rapinoe to double the USA’s lead with an emphatic shot. Abby Dahlkemper launched a ball the length of the field and Rapinoe fired into the roof of the net from the corner of the six-yard box. From there, goals from Julie Ertz and Alex Morgan followed.Ellis again fielded what has emerged as her starting line-up, the same 4-3-3 she used in the tournament’s opening match against Mexico. While the tournament itself has lacked the drama of the 2010 edition, it has marked an end to the experimentation that Ellis has undertaken since the Americans crashed out of the 2016 Rio Olympics in the quarter-finals.Asked whether this starting XI from the romp past Jamaica would be Ellis’s first-choice group in France next summer, the coach joked that it was “a big-ass crystal” to make such a prediction, but the group showed their strength.“The players in this group are players that have gone through the gauntlet in terms of being challenged and showing their quality,” Ellis said. “They have a lot of depth and a lot of talent. Right now, it’s about the game that’s in front of you. You can’t make predictions like that.”Morgan further solidified herself as a starter and continued a tear that has her at 23 goals in her last 23 games for the US. The Americans used her acceleration and pace throughout the tournament to stretch defenses and slip in behind back lines. On Sunday, she scored off a Rapinoe free-kick, coolly slotting the ball through the Jamaican defense. She later added a penalty kick.Heath also scored a brace, the fifth player to do so at this tournament. Morgan, Rapinoe and Lavelle all scored twice in earlier games while Carli Lloyd scored a hat-trick against Panama.“This whole tournament we’ve been able to score a lot of different ways and get a lot of players in on goal,” Morgan said. “The ersity and the way we’re scoring – I don’t think we’ve ever had this many different players on the score sheet in a tournament.”Defensively, the Americans weren’t tested by the Reggae Girlz, but Crystal Dunn also showed why she’s become a staple under Ellis. She started the match at left-back, and once Rose Lavelle came off for defender Emily Sonnett, Dunn moved up to the right-wing where she was a constant threat.This Concacaf tournament has very much been one of the haves and have-nots. Jamaica’s women’s team was only reestablished in 2014 after Cedella Marley, Bob Marley’s daughter, provided funding. The Jamaica Football Federation had cut funding to its women’s program in 2010.“They’re another level,” said Jamaica coach Hue Menzies. “They’re not a level for us. It’s something to learn from. Their development and the level they play at, that’s where the rest of the world has to catch up. We got to get our players in those types of environments.”With Sunday’s win, the Americans continued a dominant run through Concacaf. They still only have one loss in a qualifying tournament, the shock 2-1 defeat to Mexico in 2010.Old rivals Canada wait in the final for the Americans after they recorded a dominant 7-0 win over Panama, but the game is academic with both teams having booked their place in France next summer. Now, past qualifying mistakes will no longer haunt the Americans. They will be at the World Cup and any upsets will have to wait for another tournament.“We’re looking forward to playing them,” Heath said of Canada. “It’s always a great rivalry and it will be a good test for us to see where we are against a better opponent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd3bd6432251b96b76d7dcc913adc23998d11a24/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=101b1491822149054765fe3dda0e4797","title":"maximalism","story":"After decades of bland minimalism, people are decorating their homes to the max. Is it a response to our troubled times – or inidual expressionism?Outside, Tania James’s home looks fairly average, a flat in a Victorian conversion on a north London street lined with trees and speed bumps. Inside, it’s a riot of colour.Neon pink, yellow and orange zap across the walls, while dozens of 60s and 70s tea trays line the stairs, each a different pattern. In the living room are green and pink sofas with leopard-print cushions. A pink plastic light-up pigeon and a toy plastic horse sit on a shelf alongside a big yellow plastic bird she found in a charity shop. “I was like, oh my God, £4 – that’ll go with the pigeon!” she says. On another shelf sits her brightly coloured glass-bottle collection, which she has been adding to for the past 20 years – “it’s a one-in, one–out policy now”. There is a fireplace painted highlighter yellow, pink and purple, with a baby-sized blue plastic bear standing to attention in the grate. In the bay window, a jungle of house plants spreads its fronds. “I don’t want to say I’m attached to stuff,” says James. “I’m not materialistic – but it’s important to me to have how I feel inside, out.”She understands that the home she shares with her family is “Marmite” – someone once told her: “It’s like 10 cups of coffee with a migraine.” But she loves it. “I work from home and I literally need it,” she says. And while it may sound chaotic, on a sunny Monday morning it feels surprisingly serene.In 2018, James’s maximalism has found its moment. After decades in which the idea of a stylish home tended towards a minimalist aesthetic of pale walls and bare wood, the past few years have seen a decisive turn, with everywhere from Gucci to John Lewis to River Island bringing out flamboyant homeware ranges. Ikea once urged people to “chuck out your chintz”, but last month it launched an accessories collection by artist Per B Sundberg, who describes his work as “lush, rough and burlesque” it includes skull-shaped vases and candlesticks in the shape of poodles.On Instagram, maximalist interiors abound. James is known as Ms Pink on the site (she and her partner run a company called Quirk and Rescue, selling cushions and prints) and she points out the democratic nature of social media you would have had to buy specialist magazines in the past to access anything approaching this range of ideas. But the move towards maximalism also seems to be about other shifts: a reaction to grim political times, and a rejection of the idea of a house as, primarily, a commodity.In the 00s, as house prices rose swiftly, cultural forces, including TV property shows, encouraged home-owners to keep their house beige and bland, the idea being that this would increase its appeal should they ever need to sell or let it. Now there seems to be a move towards making our living space – big or small, rented or owned – into an expression of our personality. In other words, a home.Maximalism can be read as an escape from a world and culture that at times seems bleak. James sees it in part as a backlash against austerity: “People are like, right, what can we do to make ourselves feel good?” The American interior designer Jonathan Adler suggests it’s because “minimalism is a bummer. When you’re about to kick the bucket, you don’t want to look back and see an endless haze of beige.” He says maximalism is about surrounding yourself with things that make you “feel a little bit more glamorous than you think you are”. Rather than more-is-more, he describes this as “glamour-upon-glamour”.Pati Robins, a full-time carer whose maximalist rented home on the outskirts of Cardiff has attracted more than 50,000 Instagram followers, says maximalism for her is about “a collection of things that I love … I have to feel something for them. If something gives me a great joy or any reaction, I pick it up.” When she and her husband first started renting their home from a housing association in 2006, she says it was a nicotine-stained, “magnolia hell, all Scandi and Ikea, all white and empty”. She had moved from Poland with one suitcase and her husband “was a homeless veteran, so he didn’t have many belongings. When you live like someone else is living because you don’t want to stick out too much,” she says, “you end up feeling like a guest in your own home … it was just awful.”Tomris Tangaz, course director in interior design at Chelsea College of Art, says that during eras when “things get tough, people find ways of negotiating those climates and I think private spaces in particular – your four walls – are the only spaces that are not loaded, that are free of authority and rules”. (There are, of course, often a lot of rules that come with renting a property, which can impinge on tenants’ ability to express themselves, so it’s interesting to see how Robins and many other people on Instagram are finding ways to negotiate that.)Tangaz says there is a sense that our homes represent a rest from the world outside, and while Robins doesn’t want to ascribe too much of her home’s decor to turbulent political times – “I didn’t start maximalism after Brexit,” she says – she does think of it as her “own personal sanctuary. I close the door and I escape the world.” It’s a feeling she says her husband, who suffers from mental health problems, shares. When the house was still empty, “he felt more on edge … it reminded him of hospitals”. Now it is filled with their objects, “he’s a bit calmer”, she says.Her version of the aesthetic feels very different from James’s – her walls are painted dark colours, for instance. In her living room, the head of a donkey juts from a neon pink frame.Maximalism is all about expressing iniduality and personality, and so the cultural reference points are hugely varied. Ben Spriggs, executive editor of Elle Decoration magazine, mentions the colour-saturated worlds of Wes Anderson and the Italian palazzo look of Call Me By Your Name. Both he and James namecheck the 1980s Memphis design movement, with its squiggly patterns and bold colours, especially the aesthetic of its founder, Ettore Sottsass, whose fans included David Bowie and Elio Fiorucci – Sottsass co-designed the latter’s flagship New York store.In Luke Edward Hall’s one-bedroom flat, there are shell-shaped wall lamps, merman candlesticks and so many books that his shelves sag under their weight. He is one of the artists and interior designers most associated with today’s maximalism, and says that at a time when the world can be quite grim, it is about escaping into a fantastical universe.For him, that involves being surrounded by objects that have a story. “It is a way of expressing yourself,” he says, sitting on a mustard yellow sofa. “In the same way I have scrapbooks, it’s a way of having these memories surrounding you.” On a nearby table are small glass anchovies picked up on a trip to the Amalfi coast with his partner on another there are glass chicory and asparagus picked up in Venice. He and his partner “love anything shaped like a fish, vegetable or animal”, he says. His fridge is adorned with magnets of crustaceans, Campari and Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus. In the bedroom, there are palm-print bedsheets and a leopard-print carpet, green wallpaper and pink curtains.For James, one of the most appealing aspects of maximalism is its DIY quality – her living room includes fake cheese plant leaves bought for less than £2 from Ikea and spray-painted neon orange and pink, as well as a customised Mothercare clock from when her children were young. This customisation reminds her of the punk scene she was part of in the 70s: “People are realising that you don’t have to be rich and able to employ an interior designer – you can just get stuff you love and make it look good.”With minimalism there was a clear aesthetic, while maximalism embraces everything from Robins’s dark walls, James’s neon birds, and Hall’s shrimp magnets. “It’s much more personal,” says Tangaz, “much more about what you want to create.” Robins believes people are “getting sick and tired of living like everybody else. I think we just want to be seen as iniduals.” If that means pink walls, orange floors and lamps in the shape of artichokes, so be it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980436e5e9f1eea9c3624d34e54c245db1daf05b/0_1155_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f766009d19687900153f79ae0b11b42d","title":"easy feasting spanish spiced roast rack of pork","story":"Smoked paprika and aromatic fennel add fire and flavour to a roasted rack of pork that’s low on effort, high on impact and perfect for sharingOutdoor late summer gatherings don’t always have to mean firing up the barbecue.

Authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke explain how they got their big idea off the ground with working lunchesIt is often said that there is a book in all of us, but not all of us possess the grit, determination and means required to bring that book to fruition. By pooling their skills and working collaboratively, friends and co-authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke were able to turn their book dream into a reality.Billed as a manual for modern life for a generation of British black women, Slay in Your Lane is an ambitious debut, ning topics from education to work, dating to health, and money to representation. But what sets this guide apart from its rivals is the fact that it’s built on collaboration, combining the experiences of not just Adegoke and Uviebinené but the insights of women in their own networks, as well as interviews with dozens of Britain’s most successful black women.Today, the duo are practising what they preach. It’s a sunny midweek afternoon in August, and journalist Adegoke and marketing specialist Uviebinené are doing what they so often do – thrashing out plans for their next business move over a bite to eat and a glass of wine. The venue is stylish wine bar and eatery Sapling on Dalston’s Kingsland Road and they’re joined by one of the many women they collaborated with for the book – Anne-Marie Imafidon. She’s co-founder of Stemettes, a social enterprise that inspires young women to progress in the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) industries. The hot topic of conversation is the merits of creative collaboration.Uviebinené and Adegoke first met as freshers at Warwick University and bonded after noticing how few other black women there were on campus. Five years later, out of university and straight into the workplace, the issues of representation that first brought them together were more prominent than ever. It was after one particularly frustrating morning that Uviebinené rang Adegoke and suggested she write about their experiences. Adegoke replied with an emphatic “yes” and then an equally emphatic “but let’s do it together”.This signalled the start of a creative collaboration between the best friends, a mode of working that they both believe has been the secret ingredient to the resulting book’s success. For the two first-time authors with no publishing experience or connections to the industry, it was the decision to do it together that gave them the confidence to jump headfirst into the project. “Because there were two of us and we really believed in each other, the book went from being the twinkle of an idea to a physical proposal very easily,” Adegoke explains. “Doing it together meant we could constantly encourage each other.”Living together as they collaborated on the book meant that any time outside of their working schedules could be dedicated to dreaming up ideas for the project. Naturally, shared mealtimes became the optimum place to debrief on anything new. The pair definitely used to bond over food, Adegoke says, describing the “delicious, unusual” dishes Uviebinené would make for her: “Things like jerk salmon, pasta and seafood.” Often, friends would drop by and they’d enjoy a Thai feast and a bottle of wine. “Eating and debriefing is very much a highlight of my week,” Adegoke adds, “no-one’s ever too busy for a good meal, and it’s one of the few times in a week I can properly find out what everyone’s up to.”Beyond their own friendship group, the pair reached out to other women they knew to get involved, for help with everything from focus groups to photo shoots. Ideas were tried and tested over informal social settings, very often over food and wine. “A meeting room would feel too serious,” Uviebinené explains. “You eat, you relax and ultimately you let your guard down,” she says. “Dinner parties are always interesting, because a lot of friends have ‘side-hustles’ that they’re trying to get off the ground alongside their nine-to-five jobs. There are always a lot of ideas being bounced around over food and wine and lots of words of encouragement and advice.”The importance of women encouraging and supporting other women is critical now more than ever and Adegoke is refreshingly straight-talking on the topic. “We live in a world where most things work against women,” she says, “and on another level they work against women of colour, so it’s incredibly important for us to be there for each other.”Imafidon agrees, in her role at Stemettes she’s working to get women interested in fields too often focused towards male students. “There’s this saying: ‘You can’t be what you can’t see,’” she says. “I think it’s really important to set up environments where girls can see all the possibilities, and beyond them.”Between breaking open new industries and breaking bread with your trusted support network, collaborating on ideas and sharing advice is clearly on the menu for an increasingly social group of creative women.Made for sharingFrom delicious food and wine to music, art and words of wisdom, Campo Viejo believes that life’s better shared.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

However, the shift in viewing habits – from the arrival of Netflix and Amazon to the introduction of algorithms to select shows viewers might like and promotion of “top picks” in advanced menus on Sky and Virgin Media – has meant many TV fans bypass the traditional electronic programme guide.The broadcasters fear that commercial players are championing their own shows, while public service broadcasting content and services such as the iPlayer, ITV Hub and All4 are buried. For example, Netflix and Amazon often pay smart TV manufacturers for branded buttons on their remotes to give them top billing with viewers.“There is a global commercial battle going on to shape and influence what we watch, listen to or buy in our homes,” the letter says. “Global players have a growing influence on what UK audiences discover when they turn on their screens. Increasingly they are becoming the gatekeepers to what we watch but they have little interest in reflecting UK culture, investing in the nations and regions, or ensuring the news they provide is accurate and impartial.”This year the number of people signed up to streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon overtook the number of those signed up to pay-TV companies such as Sky, Virgin Media and BT, which themselves have swelled in popularity to be available in almost 17m households.However, the chiefs of ITV, BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5 argue that their programming is still by far the most popular in the UK, with shows such as Bodyguard, X Factor, Bake Off and Dr Who  attracting huge audiences, and public service broadcasting content is “vital” to British culture and democracy.“This is why it is so important that public service content remains easy for audiences to find,” the letter says. “Regardless of where you’re watching, which device you’re watching on, or who provides your television service, you should always be able to easily find PSB services and programmes in the UK.”Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, has just closed a consultation into the issue of due prominence. It is sympathetic to the PSBs’ case but it would require new legislation to broaden the current laws across all services.“To ensure public service channels are easy to find on TV delivered through the internet, parliament would need to introduce new legislation,” an Ofcom spokesman said. “We would support that, and we recently set out some ideas and sought views on how it might be achieved.”A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was “committed to working with PSBs and the sector to ensure our world-class TV industry continues to thrive”.Pay-TV companies, smart TV manufacturers and the Silicon Valley giants areopposed to being forced to give prominence to PSB services and content, arguing that in an on-demand world it is the viewers who decide what they want to watch.Sky argues that it already gives prominence to PSB on-demand content. The issue with raising the billing of public service broadcasters’ streaming players is that they are stacked with content outside the current PSB regulations. For example, ITV2’s Love Island and The Only Way is Essex would benefit from huge promotion but regulations only cover shows on ITV1.“Sky is the best partner PSBs never knew they had, helping to deliver significant reach, revenue and attribution,” said a spokesman for Sky. “But we can’t continue to be a good partner, and innovate as a platform, unless we have access to PSB content in all the ways viewers want. An ‘app or nothing’ approach is not in line with the spirit of industry collaboration that we all need to focus on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84d9da5b805d2a453c37c5fb05c9177c8d9e1d6/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188b775e2497b526085322b5e013e0d6","title":"three quarters of uk workers do not receive same pay each month","story":"Three-quarters of workers do not receive the same pay from one month to the next, according to a report that says sudden plunges in income are putting low-paid people at risk.The Resolution Foundation found pay volatility was particularly acute among the lowest earners and their income was more likely to fall than better-paid people’s.Workers who experienced a wage cut typically lose £290, more than the average monthly grocery bill, the report found. For those who made less than £10,000 a year, the average was £180, which represented a greater decline in income.The thinktank said this was likely to lead to “increased anxiety and stress as well as more debt, and fewer opportunities to save for the future”.It has called on the government to address the problem by reducing the number of zero-hours contracts, in which staff do not have set hours, and reforming the much-criticised universal credit benefit plan.“Much of Britain, from our bills to our welfare state, is built around a steady monthly pay cheque,” said Daniel Tomlinson, a Resolution Foundation research and policy analyst. “But our research shows this is not the reality of working life for many of us.“This volatility is a particular challenge for low-paid workers, who are less likely to have savings to fall back on when their pay packets shrink, and yet are more likely to have big falls in monthly pay.“Government and employers should look to support workers by reducing pay volatility, and mitigating its impact on workers’ living standards.”The report, entitled Irregular Payments and part-funded by social wellbeing charity the Nuffield Foundation, analysed anonymised data from 7m Lloyds Banking Group bank accounts. It concluded that pay volatility was “the norm, not the exception, across Britain’s workforce”.This causes problems for low- to middle-income earners who, the thinktank said, typically cannot save more than £10 a month and have to borrow when their pay falls.One person interviewed, named only as Hamida, said this was often due to the lack of guaranteed work on zero-hours contracts.“Sometimes they might give me three shifts a week, sometimes they might give me five or six shifts,” said Hamida. “On a crap week, I get three shifts and I live off my credit card. On a good week, I can live out of my debit card.”The mechanics of the benefit could put people off seeking additional hours at work because their overall income may fall if they did so, said the report.Struggling homeowners, working single parents and disabled people are already facing cuts of up to £52 a week owing to universal credit, according to analysis by the Policy in Practice consultancy and shared with the Observer.The Resolution Foundation said allowing claimants to have more flexibility over their assessment periods would mean the new system could help those families who experience volatile pay.It said two in five workers experienced “persistent volatility”, with significant changes in monthly pay at least six times a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f50bfe106d395327b7a50eea2e706dd09339f70/0_64_2128_1708/master/2128.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9b8cfede1b824a00bbce67fba39c26f0 1760w","title":"foreign office left disoriented and demoralised by brexit say diplomats","story":"Britain’s allies ‘have checked it into the Priory’, according to on- and off-the-record claimsThe UK’s closest diplomatic allies have “checked the UK into the Priory” recovery clinic, according to a scathing assessment of the declining influence of the UK Foreign Office.In a damning assessment in Prospect magazine, diplomats speaking on and off the record said the Foreign Office had been left disoriented and demoralised by Brexit and the successive establishment of rival departments including the Department for International Development, the trade department and the Brexit department.The UK permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, hit back in a rare public defence, denying he was a “stick in the mud traditionalist”. He said the story of the Foreign Office’s declining influence inside Whitehall had been recycled since the 19th century.In the article, Sir Tom Fletcher, the former UK ambassador to Lebanon and an occasional adviser to the Foreign Office, said “there is a risk that the rest of the world will discount Britain until we have settled our issues with Europe. Sadly some of our key allies have checked us into the Priory. They hope that we will come out renewed and reinvigorated as an international force. But they are not counting on it”.Lord Ricketts, a former Foreign Office permanent secretary, said the Foreign Office had not been able to withstand the changes or spending cuts, and that “its limbs had been amputated”. Separating the Foreign Office from policymaking on the EU is not efficient, he said.Ricketts also bemoans the lack of debate in the UK about foreign policy options post Brexit.Sir Simon Fraser, the Foreign Office permanent secretary until 2015 and a critic of Brexit, says the department has been unable to fight its corner. “Institutionally, the Foreign Office is a bit timid. One of the difficulties of being a diplomat is you tend to be diplomatic and actually government is a brutal world,” he said.Fraser said Britain should become comfortable with being a middling power. “Our voice among those who lean towards a rules-based order can still be powerful,” enabling us to “reacquire some ... agency and sense of purpose,” he said.A succession of anonymous ambassadors are quoted in the article as saying the Foreign Office is “exhausted”, in a “malaise” or suffering a crisis of confidence. They pin the blame largely on the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and his lack of interest in foreign policy, as opposed to the politics surrounding Brexit.Robin Niblett, the head of the British foreign policy thinktank Chatham House, also trains his criticism on Johnson, saying he played “with the populism that took Europe to its darkest period. Most European leaders can’t help but be frightened by the naked appeal to nationalism”. What Britain says and does legitimises what others do, he citing Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and the Hungarian prime minister, Victor Orbán.He argues the UK will need to ease its way back to cooperating with Europe, and questions the value of the slogan “Global Britain”, a phrase still supported by Theresa May but that has been voiced less frequently so far by Johnson’s successor, Jeremy Hunt.McDonald hits back at claims he has not adjusted to the emergence of new Whitehall departments, but reveals little enthusiasm for the creation of the separate department for trade. Asked if the change is a good thing, he simply replies: “It is a thing.”“The Foreign Office remains the key foreign policy player. We have one overseas network and the Foreign office runs that network,” he said. “You have a British mission and there is a Foreign Office person in charge of that mission, directing, supervising the overall British effort.”He accepted policymaking in London has become more ided, but said that was also true for domestic policy. “In the 19th century the Treasury was running everything and now departments have emerged dealing with different aspects of domestic policy. The same has happened with foreign policy. That is an explicable phenomenon,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232a36b6116dc232455fc857882905e8c0f2b75d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d231e6fb28d0b9a7c01532ea52213d","title":"scientists create sperm eggs using skin cells fertility ethical questions","story":"Scientists may soon be able to create human sperm and eggs using ordinary cells – a boon for those with fertility problems that raises troubling ethical questionsForty years ago, couples suffering from infertility were given hope by the birth of Louise Brown, the first “test-tube baby”. But although millions of babies have now been born by IVF, the technique can offer no help to couples eager to have a child that is genetically theirs but who lack the eggs or sperm to make it: men whose testes produce no sperm, say, or women who have undergone surgery for ovarian cancer. Some opt for donor eggs or sperm, but an alternative may be on the way. Scientists are making steady progress towards creating human eggs and sperm – the so-called gametes that combine in fertilisation – artificially in a petri dish.The idea is to make them from the ordinary “somatic” cells of the body, such as skin. The feasibility of such an extraordinary transformation of our flesh has only been recognised for 11 years. But already it is revolutionising medicine and assisted reproductive technologies may eventually feel the benefits too. If gametes grown in vitro prove safe for reproduction, the possibilities are dramatic – but could also be disconcerting, and might go well beyond providing eggs and sperm for those who lack them. Instead of having to undergo a painful egg-production and extraction procedure involving doses of hormones with uncertain long-term effects, a woman could have an almost limitless supply of eggs made from a scrap of skin. Huge numbers of embryos could be created easily and painlessly. What might we do with such a choice?In 2007, Japanese biologists Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi showed that a human somatic cell like a skin cell can be turned into a stem cell, the kind of cell in an early embryo that can grow into every tissue type in the body. These artificially manipulated cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and they are now being studied for growing human organs such as pancreases and kidneys outside the body for surgical transplantation. In principle, they should also be able to form eggs and sperm.This transformation of somatic cells is induced by injecting them with a cocktail of genes that generate proteins called transcription factors. In normal embryo growth, such proteins control gene activity and thereby guide cells towards their “fate” – what kind of specialised cells they become in the body. By adding the right factors artificially, a cell of one type can be tricked into thinking it is a different type. Yamanaka and Takahashi found that just four particular transcription factors were enough to persuade a skin cell to revert to acting like a stem cell. Once converted to an iPSC, a cell can then be directed by other factors towards a different fate.But to make gametes, there’s a catch. While all our other cells contain two copies of all our genes, packaged on to 46 molecular fibres called chromosomes, eggs and sperm have only one copy: 23 chromosomes in all. When an egg and sperm merge in fertilisation, the full complement of 46 is then restored. So to produce viable germ cells from stem cells, the cells have to undergo a special process called meiosis that halves their number of chromosomes.It’s not at all easy to recapitulate that process in a petri dish and until recently researchers have only managed to transform iPSCs into precursors of gametes, called primordial germ cells (PGCs), which haven’t yet undergone chromosome-halving meiosis and can’t be fertilised. But last month, a group at Kyoto University in Japan led by Mitinori Saitou reported a big step forward. They have cajoled human PGCs on to the next stage of development, called oogonia cells. It now remains to advance these further to the form called oocytes, which are ready to begin meiosis and become genuine egg cells.To develop into oogonia, the PGCs need to receive chemical signals from tissues in the ovaries. The Japanese group supplied those signals by culturing the iPSCs alongside cells taken from mouse ovaries. Despite being of a different species, the ovarian cells were able to supply the right prompts. “We did not expect this,” says Saitou, “but tried anyway and were surprised to find it worked.” Making fully functional eggs from iPSCs is already far more advanced in mice. Saitou’s team have made mouse PGCs in vitro, matured them using ovarian tissue and transplanted them back into the ovaries of live mice, where the cells completed their development into mature eggs. And two years ago they showed that they could carry out the entire reproductive cycle in vitro. They used cultures of ovary tissue to mature the “artificial” eggs, which they fertilised by IVF and grew into mouse embryos. They then harvested the embryonic stem cells and turned them into PGCs for a new cycle. Whether all this can work for human cells is another matter. Stem cell biologist Werner Neuhausser of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, doubts that the mouse ovarian cells will be capable of guiding human oogonia cells all the way to bona fide eggs, although he admits that no one really knows. “We think that we need to use human ovarian cells to mature oogonia into oocytes and then to eggs,” agrees Saitou. “We are working on it now.” What about artificial sperm? In 2011, Saitou and his colleagues reported that they had used the same strategy to make artificial mouse sperm from the skin cells of adult mice. They first reprogrammed the cells into iPSCs, induced them to become PGCs and then transplanted them into the testes of mice to complete their development into sperm. The researchers used some of this sperm to fertilise mouse eggs, which developed into apparently healthy mouse pups.Neuhausser thinks that Saitou’s approach might also work for advancing human PGCs towards sperm in vitro, by culturing them among mouse testicular cells. But again, whether fully mature sperm could be produced this way isn’t clear. Neuhausser says that it may not prove necessary, though, as even somewhat immature sperm, lacking the swimming “tail”, might be capable of fertilising an egg if injected into it. In 2016, a Chinese team claimed to have made artificial mouse sperm wholly in vitro and used it to fertilise eggs, transferring them into female mice for gestation. But some other scientists working in the field remain sceptical of those claims, which have not been repeated.“In my view, regeneration of human gametes from somatic cells in the lab is probably just a question of time and effort,” says Neuhausser. “The clinical need for such a technology is of course tremendous, as it would replace donor egg treatments.”He cautions that extensive testing will be necessary to establish the safety of such a method of assisted conception and that embryos made this way would need to be genetically tested before being implanted in the womb to check for abnormalities. “Even with these safeguards in place we would have to accept some residual risk,” he says. “Ultimately, some patients would have to make a leap of faith if this technology enters clinical trials.” All the same, says bioethicist Henry Greely of Stanford University in California, “I don’t see any show stopper that will keep what is feasible in mice from working in humans.”If eggs and thus IVF embryos could be produced easily and in large numbers, says Greely, that could change the landscape of assisted conception when combined with the option of genetic screening. This can be done ever more cheaply and quickly for embryos and is currently permitted in the UK for identifying those carrying certain genetic disease mutations.With such technologies in place, says Greely, “the stage is set for very, very widespread use of embryo selection”.That conjures up scary images of a genetic elite being bred by those who can afford it, as in the film Gattaca. “But,” says Neuhausser, “the feasibility and cost of embryo screening will largely depend on the efficiency of generation of healthy human embryos from in vitro-derived eggs and sperm. If only one in 1,000 embryos is ‘normal’, this may prove to be too difficult and expensive for routine IVF.”Making artificial gametes could introduce new permutations into how we reproduce. The somatic cells of both men and women could in principle be transformed into eggs and sperm. So gay couples of both sexes could have babies that were genetically related to both parents, although male couples would need a surrogate mother. Rather more challenging is the notion of a single inidual conceiving a child from eggs and sperm both made from his or her cells, what Greely calls the “unibaby” of a “uniparent”, which could become some grotesque vanity project. Equally disturbing is the prospect that genetic parents could include, say, the very elderly, children or even foetuses. The ability to make gametes from any bodily residue we leave lying around – “like cells you leave on beer bottles and wine glasses,” says Greely – opens up other alarming scenarios. You can imagine the celebrity paternity suits already.We don’t have to worry about it quite yet, though. “I get lots of emails from people saying, ‘My husband is infertile, he’s desperate to have kids,’” says Azim Surani, a developmental biologist at the University of Cambridge University and leading specialist on artificial gametes. “Well, nothing is impossible, but this is very complex if you’re going to think about clinical applications.” He says that to establish feasibility and safety for human reproduction, there would have to be some work first on non-human primates, which is slow. “It probably won’t happen here, but there are facilities in China and Japan that might do it,” he says, adding: “I don’t think it will happen within 10 years.”But it all comes from a revolution in our understanding of what cells can do. “When I think about it, it is quite astonishing,” says Surani. “Each cell in your body is a potential gamete. This is a profound change in the way we think about cells.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/313f2a0b1a43dd32b31b3ddb989ef153a92fafdf/0_98_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f461314d15d13e17fb20bb1781e8847c","title":"loneliness social prescribing theresa may","story":"Doctors will be encouraged to refer patients to art groups, cookery classes and other activitiesGPs in England will be able to refer people to take part in social activities such as cookery classes, walking clubs and art groups to combat loneliness, the prime minister has said.Instead of offering medication, doctors will be encouraged to use “social prescribing” to refer lonely patients to activities that could help tackle feelings of isolation.Launching the first government loneliness strategy, Theresa May said social prescriptions would reduce demand on the NHS and improve patients’ quality of life. She plans for the new approach to be in place by 2023. In addition, the prime minister announced an extra £1.8m for community projects, such as creating new community cafes, art spaces or gardens.May also paid tribute to the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who campaigned to end loneliness before her death. “Cox was absolutely right to highlight the critical importance of this growing social injustice, which sits alongside childhood obesity and mental wellbeing as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time,” May said.She added: “I was pleased to be able to support the loneliness commission set up in Jo’s name and I am determined to do everything possible to take forward its recommendations.”May described the strategy as the beginning of a long and far-reaching social change in England. “It is a vital first step in a national mission to end loneliness in our lifetimes,” she said.The government finalised its strategy to combat loneliness, which charities, councils and health experts say has increased in recent years as a result of lengthening lifes, cuts to social care services and families becoming more spread out geographically.Loneliness is linked to illnesses including heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.The government’s first loneliness strategy was drawn up after Tracey Crouch, the world’s first minister for loneliness, embraced research set up by Cox, which found that young people can be affected more than older people.Crouch said the strategy aimed to bring together health services, businesses, councils, charities and community groups to help people build connections to lead happier and healthier lives. “Loneliness is a serious issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds and it is right that we tackle it head on,” she said. “Our strategy sets out a powerful vision for addressing this generational challenge.”Speaking on behalf of the Jo Cox Foundation, Cox’s sister Kim Leadbeater said she was delighted by the strategy. “The work on loneliness has been a hugely important part of Jo’s legacy,” she said. “It is excellent to see that loneliness is now firmly on the government’s agenda, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has been involved in getting us to this point.”May also announced the first employer pledge to tackle loneliness in the workplace, which has the support of businesses such as Sainsbury’s and the civil service. Postal workers will be encouraged to check in with lonely people on their delivery rounds in a scheme with Royal Mail in Liverpool, New Malden and Whitby.The new funding builds on £20m announced in June to help charities and community groups expand their programmes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e31a4b335ab7b9a74eaeda707ebf40e43c1b5b/0_110_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215b4019a6f06a284de3e85136c78c0f","title":"bha tim farron equine welfare","story":"Racing’s ruling body has clashed with Tim Farron, the former Liberal Democrats leader, on the eve of a parliamentary debate about racehorse welfare. The debate, to take place in Westminster Hall on Monday afternoon, is the result of an e-petition which gathered more than 100,000 signatures, calling on the government to set up a new regulator for equine welfare, independent of the British Horseracing Authority.The creation of such a body is now Lib Dem policy, following the passing of a motion at the party’s conference last month – the aim being “to prevent abuse of racehorses and reduce avoidable deaths”. Farron, who is the party’s spokesman on rural affairs and farming, hopes to attend the debate.“The job of the BHA is to promote the sport,” he said on Sunday. “Horse welfare is only part of their work. It won’t ever be a priority unless there is a widespread problem among the horses. An independent regulatory body would have horse welfare at the forefront of its thinking without interfering in the authority’s task of hyping the sport.”In response Robin Mounsey, of the BHA, said Farron had “misunderstood” the authority’s role and pointed to Great British Racing as the body responsible for marketing the sport. “The role of the BHA is to be the sport’s governing body and regulator with responsibility for, amongst other things, equine welfare,” Mounsey said.“As regulator, equine welfare is inextricably linked with everything we do, including educating our participants, their licensing, inspections of stables and racecourses, officiating on racedays, veterinary checks, anti‑doping, investigation and prosecution of disciplinary cases, aftercare of racehorses once they retire, a programme of innovation and improvement to reduce injury, and biosecurity plans. We will be writing again to Mr Farron, whose constituency includes Cartmel, to suggest a meeting to discuss our work on equine welfare regulation.”The debate on Monday arises from an e-petition promoted by Animal Aid, an animal rights organisation which is fundamentally opposed to the use of animals in sport and would welcome an end to horse racing. Nevertheless, the BHA says it is glad of the chance to demonstrate the amount of work it does to promote horse welfare.“British racing is amongst the world’s best regulated animal activities,” Mounsey said, “with our horses provided with a level of care and a quality of life that is virtually unsurpassed by any other domesticated animal.”The government has said it sees no need for an independent welfare regulator and, in its response to the e-petition, quoted a BHA statistic that the fatality rate per runner has fallen by a third in 20 years. As recently as Friday the government answered a written question by saying it is “satisfied that the BHA works to make horse racing as safe as possible”.However, the RSPCA is prepared to consider the case for an equine welfare regulator. Its deputy chief executive, Chris Wainwright, said: “We work really closely with the BHA and we think that relationship has resulted in lots of really good improvements, whether it’s the use of the whip, hurdles design or the review of Aintree. Obviously more needs to be done and our view is quite simple: we want whatever is best for animal welfare.“So, if the BHA carry on with really great work, are even more determined to improve animal welfare, a bit more public, perhaps, about some of the issues that need to be addressed, then we’re happy to carry on working with them. But equally we wouldn’t rule out an independent regulator just for the sake of ruling it out.Tips by Chris Cook“If it could be shown through a feasibility study that, actually, that was the smartest way forward, that it would improve public trust and result in fewer horse fatalities and improved welfare, then of course we’d be happy to have that conversation. It’s an interesting debate and I don’t think anyone should be scared to debate what’s the best way to regulate the welfare of horses.”Wainwright said that he will be “extremely interested” in the BHA’s review of fatalities at the Cheltenham Festival this year, due to be published this autumn, and that its conclusions would indicate the BHA’s “direction of travel”. He said: “If we don’t think it’s strong enough, of course we’ll be very open with the BHA and the public about that. We’re a constructive friend to the BHA but ultimately our interest is in the welfare of animals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25d332bc7559619548a1ed39618b0ecee2730023/182_241_2218_1331/master/2218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=398535aaad8a700217d4ed43492e7d3d","title":"the wider earth review natural history museum london","story":"Natural History Museum, LondonCharles Darwin’s adventures aboard the HMS Beagle are told through engrossing puppetry and painterly projectionsThis is an unusual enterprise. The museum’s Jerwood Gallery has been turned into a theatre to house a production by Australia’s Dead Puppet Society, telling the story of Charles Darwin’s five-year-long voyage on HMS Beagle. Written, directed and co-designed by David Morton, it is visually terrific even if the script rarely rises above the level of a schools broadcast.Morton rightly reminds us that Darwin (played with boyish enthusiasm by Bradley Foster) was only 22 when he was plucked out of Cambridge in 1831 to be the resident naturalist on the Beagle’s historic journey. We also get a hint of the arguments between Darwin and the ship’s captain, Robert FitzRoy, over slavery, colonialism and religion. But the script is more concerned with providing information than drama, and perpetuates the idea that Darwin, through his theory of evolution, single-handedly undermined orthodox faith, whereas the debate between science and religion was longstanding.What the show does offer is an engrossing spectacle. Using techniques similar to those of the South African Handspring Puppet Company that inspired War Horse, the seven actors manipulate puppets that bring the natural world to life: we get everything from armadillos, cormorants, fireflies and tortoises to a giant fossilised seashell. There are also beautiful painterly projections, the work of Justin Harrison, which whisk us from the rolling Shropshire hills to the fiery shores of Tierra del Fuego and the teeming abundance of the Galápagos Islands.

With the team’s first trip into outer space, Doctor Who is feeling like Doctor Who again opening titles, a stunning new Tardis, behind-sofa-worthy scares and, most crucially of all, running.The Doctor also feels like the Doctor again. With her unstable-regeneration routine out of the way, Jodie Whittaker has grown almost completely into the role. She nails most of the character’s defining traits with aplomb: disdain for guns, delight in thinking her way out of a problem, and the ability to quickly become ruthless– her takedown of the boorish Epzo was quite something to behold. She is a delight.The cinematic air of this new series was no episode one wonder either. The Ghost Monument has to be one of the most handsome-looking episodes we have witnessed, Planet Desolation’s alien vistas realised with stunning South African locations. True, the studio-bound night sequences cannot help but sag in comparison, but providing that they are not just splurging the budget at the start of the series, things bode well.The new Tardis too is a thing of wonder. Its grand coral and imposing hexagons, dark light and sheer expanse make it a far more intimidating place than previous iterations. Chibnall stubbornly resists having anyone utter “but it’s bigger on the inside!” however that enchanting sequence where the team first enter is a near-perfect end to a tense, taut and satisfying adventure. This is significantly more like it.Plot-wise The Ghost Monument was a relatively straightforward chase through the world’s most brutal assault course, a sort of Hunger Games meets The Running Man. The gang are rather conveniently scooped out from their certain death space-float by two battered spaceships, mistaken for “bonuses” by the respective pilots, bickering competitors Angstrom and Epzo. The final two contestants in The Last Rally of the Five Galaxies, they have out-survived thousands in a messed-up Krypton Factor through space, and are now on the verge of winning untold riches. Because of nebulous reasons, the mythical Ghost Monument that represents the finish line is actually the Tardis. So, chided on by the holographic games master (Art Malik), our reluctant team of six are sent through what is essentially a sequence of spooky and scary set-pieces across a “planet made cruel”, including killer water, mercenary Sniperbots, strangling bedsheets (I think) and fields of acetylene.Susan Lynch and Sean Dooley make for a durable guest cast of fleshed-out characters with disarming backstories and motivations. Angstrom by turns both beautifully warm and utterly tragic Epzo one of the most wilfully unpleasant guests companions Doctor Who has seen. Frankly, he is a dickhead, and the reasons why are obvious.Taken together, the whole thing is good old-fashioned rollicking, albeit with some slightly off-beam messaging as the day is saved by a cigar. The assembly of team Tardis has been curious this season. There have been no inspirational scenes of the characters running away from unfulfilling lives in search of adventures in space and time. Graham, Yaz and Ryan have been taken off quite by accident, and even when we get to that breathtaking arrival in the Tardis, the plan is still to take them home. So that is surely all to come.Thankfully, Grace’s death has not been swiftly moved-on-from Ryan is compartmentalising his grief, while Graham’s attempts to bond with his step-grandson are meeting mixed results. Neither has Ryan’s dyspraxia been forgotten as he struggles climbinga ladder. An impulsive young man alright, his trigger-happy approach to the Sniperbots falls flat, although his Call of Duty battle cry is priceless.For all of this character work, Yaz is feeling something of a spare part, but hopefully that will change. But as the Doctor appeared to be giving up hope towards the end, her new friends started to truly band together.The linear piling up of scares and dangers one by one was effective in keeping everything hurtling along. The Sniperbots were as effective as you could reasonably expect knock-off Stormtroopers to ever be, and the psychological chills of the Doctor’s fears being weaponised really got me. But I must say, the sequence where Epzo is half-suffocated by whatever-those-things-were was the most disturbing Doctor Who moment I have seen in quite some time.The deathly goings-on on Planet Desolation are revealed to be the work of the Stenza. Who, if you remember, was the race of the tooth-faced trophy-hunter T’zim-Sha, or Tim Shaw from last week. With two mentions in a week, was that just a subtle nod or the seeding of a Big Bad for the series? Chibnall said there would be no through-line this year, but as we all know, Doctor Who producers do not mind the odd fib.Team Tardis are clearly going home to the long way round. Their first trip takes them to 1955, the US civil rights struggle, and an encounter with a certain Rosa Parks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/190f88205a51b2958f24c2cbd77727c1d8aaac10/79_135_2384_1430/master/2384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae2aef7e6fe70b835629cf0e45f9d9cb","title":"mondays best tv 50 years of the booker black earth rising","story":"All the bitterness, backbiting and predictably erudite put-downs from the literary world’s premier prize, plus Hugo Blick’s compelling thriller continues9pm, BBC FourAn enjoyably acid-tinged history of Britain’s pre-eminent literary award, full of controversy, backbiting and enjoyably florid put-downs: witness Anthony Burgess dismissing it as “a rather small, parochial prize suitable for rather small, parochial writers” (in fairness, he had just lost).

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States. The Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria supported Germany.Do you have letters, diaries, photographs or even memorabilia from any relatives or friends who remember Armistice Day?

She said the party would urgently consult before a state election in Hesse in two weeks’ time. “We need to address the issues which are burning under people’s fingernails,” she added.The party more or less took for granted its dominant position as the standalone leader in Bavaria, but its power base started to erode with the demise of the mainstream political landscape across Germany and elsewhere in Europe.However, the dramatic slide in the CSU’s fortunes coincided with the arrival of about 1 million refugees to Germany in the summer of 2015 through Bavaria, causing uncertainty and some xenophobia.The CSU leadership under Söder and the party leader, Horst Seehofer – who is also the federal interior minister – did its best to blame the growing sense of instability in Bavaria on Merkel’s refugee policy.In an effort to tackle the backlash against Muslim refugees, it introduced a law requiring classrooms and public buildings to hang the crucifix and ban the full-face Islamic veils.The fallout over the refugee crisis and disputes between Seehofer and Merkel over how to control Germany’s border have almost led to the collapse of her fragile coalition.But in the weeks running up to the election, successive polls showed the CSU’s hardline stance and its near-success in causing the government’s collapse had prompted a haemorrhaging of voters to other parties.The CSU’s dismal result leaves in doubt the political futures of both Söder and Seehofer.Speaking on Sunday evening, Seehofer said the party would “draw the necessary consequences” from the poor result over the following weeks, but did not refer to his or Söder’s futures.The forthcoming makeup of the Bavarian government is unclear, although the Greens have signalled their willingness to enter a coalition with the CSU, which in turn is uneasy about such an alliance. Statistically, the CSU could also form a government with the Free Voters, with whom they have considerably more in common.Reacting to the vote, Thomas Steinleitner, a 50-year-old baker from the town of Deggendorf who abandoned the CSU for the first time, said the party had lost touch with its supporters.“They just repeated what the AfD said, and I don’t identify with them any more. The CSU and CDU – all the big parties – it feels like they work together with industry, but us normal people are not important to them,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e31aca7cc8e5b30833508fc6b3468379af6ae4/629_688_3576_2145/master/3576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c460bbfd1b26dbe8c97a105a7ca066a","title":"jamal khashoggi turkey looks to uk to persuade saudi arabia to cooperate","story":"JP Morgan and Ford join ranks of companies pulling out of Saudi conference as UK, Germany and France call for credible investigationSaudi Arabia has said it will retaliate against any sanctions imposed over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, as JP Morgan and Ford swelled the ranks of western companies pulling out of a high-profile conference in Riyadh next week.The diplomatic standoff over the fate of Khashoggi, who has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October and is presumed to have been murdered, threatens Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s to reform efforts to reform the kingdom’s economy. The Riyadh stock market had its biggest fall in years on Sunday.Donald Trump has threatened the US ally with “severe punishment” if Khashoggi, who has been critical of Bin Salman, has been killed.The French, German and UK foreign secretaries ratcheted up the pressure by releasing a joint statement calling on the Saudi government to give a complete and detailed account of Khashoggi’s disappearance, adding that those found to be responsible must be held to account.Riyadh vowed to hit back against any action. “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations,” it said.The country’s foreign ministry issued a series of tweets rejecting the accusations as “attempts to undermine” Saudi Arabia, writing in one post “demise is the outcome of these weak endeavors”.Business leaders as well as media companies including Bloomberg and CNN have pulled out of an investment conference next week in Riyadh, dubbed “Davos in the desert”.Jamie Dimon, the powerful boss of JP Morgan, on Sunday became the latest to say he would not be attending. Ford chief executive Bill Ford also announced he would not be going. Neither gave a reason for the cancellations.The belligerence of the Saudi statement is likely to anger US senators pressing for the Trump administration to take tough economic action against Riyadh, including sanctions.It showed no sign of contrition or clarification of the promise last week to conduct an inquiry into Khashoggi’s disappearance. Instead, Riyadh condemned a “campaign of false allegations and falsehoods”. In what is likely to be a reference to Turkey, and possibly its Gulf rival Qatar, Saudi Arabia claimed some were “rushing and seeking to exploit rumours and accusations to achieve goals and agendas unrelated to the search for truth”.Saudi Arabia’s vast oil reserves, said to be about 260bn barrels, give it enormous clout in the global economy. It has significant power to drive up prices, which would hurt every major developed economy.Turki Aldhakhil, the general manager of Al Arabiya, the official Saudi news channel, claimed in an opinion piece that Riyadh was ready to implement 30 measures “without flinching” the moment US sanctions were imposed, including cuts to oil production that could lead to prices rising to $100 a barrel.“The truth is that if Washington imposes sanctions on Riyadh, it will stab its own economy to death, even though it thinks that it is stabbing only Riyadh,” he wrote.Aldhakhil warned the repercussions of US sanctions could include a military alliance between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and an end to intelligence sharing.In the firmest joint language to appear from Europe since the crisis broke, the European foreign ministers said “light must be shed on Khashoggi’s disappearance”.They said they shared the “grave concerns” expressed by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and “are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness. There needs to be a credible investigation to establish the truth about what happened, and – if relevant – to identify those bearing responsibility for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi and ensure that they are held to account.”The statement added: “We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response. We have conveyed this message directly to the Saudi authorities.”Over the weekend, Turkey pressed the UK to use its influence to ensure Saudi Arabia abides by its commitment to launch a joint investigation into Khashoggi’s disappearance.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, is due to meet his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, in London on Monday afternoon. He complained that Saudi Arabia was not allowing Turkish investigators to enter the consulate.Speaking on Sunday, Hunt said: “What they need to do is cooperate fully with the investigations … and to get to the bottom of this.“If, as they say, this terrible murder didn’t happen then where is Jamal Khashoggi? If they have got nothing to hide then they will, and should, cooperate.” The UK also suggested the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, may withdraw from the investment conference if it is shown the Saudi government was involved in the suspected murder.The official UK position is that Fox’s diary for that week is yet to be finalised. Any British action is likely to be coordinated with the US.Speaking at the weekend, Trump said – without being specific – there were “very powerful” things the west could do to hurt the Saudis, but stopping arms sales would in the end be America punishing itself.Democratic senators on the US foreign relations committee said classified intelligence briefings suggested Khashoggi had been murdered by the Saudis or rendered back to Saudi Arabia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a1ec1706a458a8db15c6cb50a1fa8e49960112/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18a10d6a20417d79de3fe95554db5efd","title":"macedonia mps to vote on name change in key moment for balkans","story":"Stakes are high with Nato and EU membership and prime minister’s future in balanceIn a vote with repercussions for the stability of one of Europe’s most conflict-prone regions, MPs in Macedonia are poised to decide on Monday whether to accept changing the Balkan country’s name.The country’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, is locked in battle to secure the requisite support, and the MPs’ ballot will be knife-edge. “It is going to be decisive for him,” said Branko Geroski, a prominent political commentator speaking from Skopje, the former Yugoslav republic’s capital. “Either he wins the two-thirds majority needed to ratify the Prespa agreement with Greece or he calls early elections.”The stakes could not be higher. If MPs agree to the strategic state being rechristened North Macedonia, membership of Nato and EU beckon. Both are seen as vital for a country where conflict between Macedonian Slavs and a restive Albanian minority was only narrowly averted in 2001.Zaev has staked his future on the name-change deal reached with Athens earlier this year. Since the republic proclaimed independence 27 years ago, Greece had argued that its name concealed territorial ambitions against its own adjacent province of Macedonia.The social democrat leader faces formidable opposition from a strong nationalist front and needs 80 votes in the 120-seat parliament, but his two-party coalition only has the backing of 72 MPs.Parliamentarians will be asked on Monday if it agrees with a proposal to rewrite the republic’s constitution to reflect its new name.“Even if enough do that, there is no guarantee they will then vote in support of the amendments that will follow,” Geroski said. “It will be a complicated and very risky process.”The prospect of the tiny country being plunged into political turmoil rose as rightwing opposition politicians downplayed the likelihood of Zaev winning MPs’ backing. “There will be no two-thirds majority, do not hope for it,” the VMRO MP Trajko Veljanovski said last week.The vote in Skopje is being watched nervously in Athens, where the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has also faced protests over the deal, most notably from his own junior partner in office, the nationalist Anel party. Greece must also ratify the agreement if passed by its neighbour.Ahead of the ballot, Zaev said the vote marked a historic opportunity for the former communist country to be embraced by the west. Russian meddling in the region has increased dramatically and Moscow has been accused of masterminding a well-orchestrated disinformation campaign through social media before the referendum.“This chance will not be repeated,” Zaev said as he urged opposition MPs to vote responsibly.Tsipras and Zaev were hailed by the EU’s foreign affairs commissioner at the weekend for the courage they had shown in ending the dispute and agreeing to the name deal. “This is a unique opportunity for reconciliation in south-east Europe … an opportunity that might not come again any time soon,” Federica Mogherini said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c69f7a6f449c2b6420e6039ce5e310188f1c790/142_478_2484_1491/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=709bf272292f8cdc2ab252b135a91353","title":"teens tiaras quinceanera celebrations cuba havana diana markosian in pictures","story":"The quinceañera, the 15th birthday rite of passage into womanhood, is widely celebrated in Latino culture.

Don’t you just love them? Barely a week goes past without some people losing the run of themselves at the sight of the next big thing that promises to make them thinner or more beautiful or happier. But how does a food turn into a fad? And is there any merit in any of them? Pricewatch went in search of some answers.They look like doughnuts and flake like croissants and for a brief spell five years ago the world – or at least that part of the world that was wealthy enough to care about such things – went nuts for cronuts. New York city pastry chef Dominique Ansel was the man who invented the tasty morsel and, within days of him rolling it out in his Big Apple bakery in May 2013, hundreds of people were queuing outside the bakery (proving we are not the only ones who should hang our heads in shame when it comes to mindless queuing). Within two months they were here – thanks to the Marker Hotel’s excellent executive chef Gareth Mullins. They can still be bought here – and they are as nice as they were at the outset – but the world quickly moved on and you could probably get through a whole year without hearing the word cronut mentioned once, except for now obviously.“When you mix high-quality coffee beans with the right fats, you get an amazing drink that stomps on hunger and cravings, banishes brain fog and helps you lose weight, build muscle, and increase focus and performance,” so said Dave Asprey, the man who decided putting coffee and butter together was a good idea. As his notion of adding butter to coffee gained traction, he told the world that he ate 4,500 calories a day and had not exercised in more than two years but still his “world-class anti-ageing physician” put him in “the lowest percentile” for all manner of illnesses. Medics were sceptical of his claims and so was Pricewatch having tried it on more than one occasion and not turned into svelte Adonis. While the butter coffee hasn’t gone away, like the cronut it has stopped making headlines.Have you ever wondered how kale got cool? How was it that something that was a cheap staple of Irish mammies for hundreds of years suddenly started appearing on menus in exotic locations all over the world with a sometimes ludicrous price attached to it? Well, according to a story we have seen reproduced multiple times, it wasn’t an accident. The American Kale Association (yes, that IS a thing) sought out super-cool New York PR man Oberon Sinclair to work his magic on its product and suddenly kale was the next big thing.It first appeared on the menu of New York’s hip restaurant The Fat Radish – which happened to be a Sinclair client too – in 2010. Then Beyonce wore the word on a T-shirt and Gwyneth Paltrow made kale crisps on the Ellen de Generes Show. By 2012 Time Magazine was declaring kale one of the top food trends of the year. Today no self-respecting hipster cafe will countenance a menu without at least some kale on it.There was time – and it wasn’t that long ago – when you couldn’t swing a cat without hitting a cupcake. They were on every street corner and at every wedding, going away do and birthday party in this part of the world. Sex and the City is to blame. In an episode broadcast on May 10th, 1998, Carrie and Miranda spent just over a minute sitting outside the Magnolia Bakery on Bleecker Street eating vanilla cupcakes. They spent that minute talking – on the off chance that you can’t remember – about Carrie’s crush on Aidan and Miranda’s thing with Steve. But the watching world cared less about what was coming out of their mouths and a whole lot more about what was going into them.Within hours of the broadcast, people were queuing up to be like Carrie (and to a lesser degree Miranda) and apparently happy to spend $4 on a single cupcake. Quickly the cupcake craze spread across the world and we were all at it. But not any more. There are no queues outside cupcake shops today and people no longer bring cupcakes to work to lift colleagues’ spirits.Instead people bring doughnuts. There are dozens of doughnut shops across the State, and Portland and Instagram are to blame. The Hipster capital of the US is where the trend for the tarted-up doughnut first emerged seven years ago and Instagram is the social media platform that made Homer Simpson’s favourite treats cool because, it turns out, the sugary greasy lumps are actually very photogenic. In fact, there are now over 10 million separate photographs of doughnuts on the social media platform. It’s hard to imagine what the puritanical Dutch who first introduced the doughnut to New Amsterdam – as it was then known – under the less than appetising name olykoeks (or oily cakes) would make of it all.If you have ever asked yourself why we can’t have nice things you need look no further than the breakfast roll. In the late 1990s we got a lovely thing – freshly baked French baguettes – and we almost instantly stuffed it with rashers, sausages, eggs, hash browns, butter and ketchup turning it into a waist-widening heart attack to go. There was a time – a time before the economic unpleasantness of a decade ago – when queues formed outside of convenience stores and petrol station forecourts every morning. The queues were made up of builders and hungover students and office workers looking to get some stodgy artery-clogging grease into themselves as fast as possible. There were even number one songs written about it while celebrated economists created characters based around the breakfast roll.To find out where it came from we looked through The  archive. The phenomena first appeared in print in this paper in a piece about female drunkenness in 2000. A decade ago, sociologist Dr Perry Share, of Sligo Institute of Technology, published a study of the jumbo breakfast roll in which he said it was “perhaps the ultimate symbol of our contemporary Celtic Tigerland”. He traced the breakfast roll back to Victorian England when roadside vendors would sell soft rolls containing ham, sausage or egg to the workers heading to the factories. It took off in Ireland when Cuisine de France and fancier fuel forecourts became a thing.In 2015 sales of courgettes soared as people tried out their new spiralising machines and retailers raced to cash in on a new fad. Courgetti became a thing and influential food writers, including well-regarded millennial bloggers Hemsley \u0026amp Hemsley, told us we could eat long thin strings of courgette with Bolognese or pesto instead of pasta. Suddenly spiralising machines were everywhere as frantic people looked to get in on a trend. We can’t be certain but the number of spiralising machines now gathering dust in kitchen cabinets across Ireland must be in the hundreds of thousands.The first mention of spiralising in this paper was a mere four years ago in a piece written by Róisín Ingle. “Life is just better when you can, at a whim, whip out a courgette and turn it into stunning looking spirals of green goodness that look not unlike spaghetti. And then you start calling it courghetti and you aren’t even embarrassed,” she wrote. We checked in with her last week see if she was still spiralising. “No,” she admitted. “I did for a while and I loved it, I really did but I don’t even know where it is any more. I think I might have broken it.” She is not alone.For thousands of years – going all the way back to the Incas – the people of Peru, Chile and Bolivia happily grew and ate quinoa and they had plenty of it to go around. It started being exported to the US only in the 1980s. Fast forward 20 years to when it was discovered by foodies who decreed the ancient seed to be a better option than wheat, couscous or rice. Suddenly the newly classified superfood (a ridiculous word if ever there was one) was everywhere.It is probably more healthy than many other options and it tastes grand but the heightened global demand has put pressure on many South American farmers to keep up with demand.In 2010 few people in Ireland – save for those who have spent time in the barbecuing parts of the US – had even heard of pulled pork but within five years it was virtually everywhere. High-end restaurants and low-rent delis were all selling versions of the slow cooked mushy pork mess. It actually comes from a western part of North Carolina and is typically made using the shoulder of a pig cooked slowly over barbecue coals until it is soft enough to be “pulled” into shreds and doused in barbecue sauce. That is not how most Irish food outlets prepared pulled pork which made its very existence here questionable. While you might still be able to get a pulled pork sandwich in some places in Ireland today it is nowhere near as faddy as it was even two years ago.A decade ago getting a burrito in Dublin would have proved beyond most people. There was a place in the Epicurean Food Hall which has since – sadly – become a Dealz and that was mostly it. Today there are more than 30 such burrito bars across the city and the size of the queues outside any one of the many Boojum’s that have opened in recent years suggest there is a whole lot of life in the fad yet. It is not hard to see the appeal. The food is lovely, moderately healthy and reasonably priced and it is a decent alternative to more traditional fast food options. The little donkeys can be messy to eat mind you.If you tried to open a hipster restaurant without putting this on your menu you’d be laughed out of it. And heaven forbid you’d call your avocado anything other than smashed. “Mashed avocado? Yuk . . . Smashed avo? Amazing.” The brunch favourite was invented in Australia and started to get cool in the 1990s when Sydney chef and restaurateur and brunch king pin Bill Granger added lime, salt and chilli flakes to the mix. The notion then travelled to the US and there was no holding it back once Instagram came along in 2010.Gwyneth Paltrow helped to popularise it in her cookbook It’s All Good. Typically avocado on toast costs around a tenner in an Irish restaurant today but you can buy an avocado – sorry, an avo – in a supermarket for not much more than a euro while the lime juice, chilli, salt and bread will cost around the same again. Money for jam, it is.They just keep rearing their ugly, pointless and utterly useless heads. All detox diets are nonsense. Foods do not help you detox. Your organs do. If you ever see anything that promises to detoxify you simple walk away you will be doing yourself a favour.By accident, Pricewatch found itself in a super cool new restaurant in Dublin last week that ticked all the hipster boxes – there was smashed avo, overnight oats, spiralised things, kale, cauliflower and all the rest. But our eye was caught by one thing in particular. Charcoal lemonade. Is that a thing now, we wondered. Turns out it is.It is a brand new – to us – fad and the charcoal is said to brighten skin and teeth and cleanse organs. We spent €4 on a small cup of the stuff. It was black and lemony and perfectly pleasant. But did we feel cleansed or bright? No, no we did not."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663475.1539548386!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no change to public access at luggala estate say owners","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew signage at Luggala. Boleyhorrigan Bridge, overlooking Lough Tay with Luggala Mountain on the right. Photograph: The The trust which owns the large Luggala Estate in Co Wicklow has insisted there is no change regarding public access to certain areas within its grounds.The trust has also defended erection of signs on the property in recent months.Luggala is a private estate owned by the trustees of a Guinness family trust for many years and was the former home of Guinness heir and co-founder of Claddagh Records, Garech Browne, who died earlier this year. It is up for sale.The estate is controlled by the trustees of Barbican International Corporation, based in Guernsey.“There are no public rights of way or rights of access to any of the estate. However, successive owners over recent years permitted public access to certain parts of the estate via the present pedestrian access gate,” said the trust.The number of visitors to the area since Browne’s death has “increased considerably”, according to the trust.It said the owners had a duty of care regarding the estate. Consequently, a decision was taken to erect signage confirming that Luggala is private property and that the pedestrian access gate beside the public road would be closed from 5.30pm each day. This was a common practice in similar settings over privately owned land, the trust added.“The terrain at Luggala is mountainous and there are many exceptionally steep and unsafe sections,” it noted. “The present signage represents a guide to the public to those areas of the estate which continue to be accessible at the permission of the current owners of the estate. They also mark points of exceptionally steep and dangerous fells immediately adjoining the public road above.”There were, however, specific sections of the estate that have never been accessible to the public, it noted. “It is around these sections that the current signage has been erected as a clear indication of these private areas of the estate.”But former Green Party TD and environmental activist Roger Garland has taken exception to the latest signage. He believes it could only damage relations between the owners and people in the local and hill walking community.He said the “anti-walker” signs had serious health and safety implications because the walking route, as well as accessing Lough Dan, “provides access to two mountains, Fancy Mountain and Knocknacloghoge”.Mountaineering Ireland has called on the Government to acquire 4,000 acres of the estate, overlooking Lough Tay, for public recreational use. This land is adjacent to Wicklow National Park and has significant scientific and bioersity value.The National Parks and Wildlife Service has recommended the State buy that portion of the property because of its “strategic importance” and tourism potential. But the quoted price for the entire 5,000-acre estate, including Luggala Hunting Lodge , is €28 million.Browne famously entertained celebrated musicians, actors and writers at the lodge, a Regency Gothic house restored inside and out by its long-time custodian .“Luggala has been viewed by a number of interested parties,” said a spokesman for the trust. “The estate is on the open market for purchase by any interested parties, including the State.”Browne’s mother Oonagh first turned the valley and its one-time shooting lodge – built by the La Touche family who founded Bank of Ireland – into a cultural haven for artists. The biggest loss she suffered was Tara, her younger son, who was killed while speeding through London in a car at the age of 21.The Beatles, who knew him as a bright young thing around town, immortalised him in A Day in the Life, at the heart of their Sgt Pepper’s album.The remains of Tara Browne and other members of the family are buried at a Doric temple in Luggala."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663425.1539543651!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minute s silence marks launch of smear test support group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan, Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh at the formal launch of the 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group in Farmleigh, Phoenix Park, Dublin on Sunday. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Farmleigh on a beautiful autumn day, the trees turning brown under a clear blue sky the kind of place you bring the family for a tramp along leaf-strewn paths on a Sunday afternoon.You could hear those families enjoying themselves outside while a minute’s silence was being observed in a meeting room for other families who have been sundered by cancer, and who were attending the launch of the support group for the women at the centre of the CervicalCheck controversy.The silence was for Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who died last Wednesday leaving five children behind for a woman identified only as Julie, who died a week ago leaving behind four children and two grandchildren and for the 18 other women who have died.“Silence,” as Stephen Teap, whose wife Irene died of cervical cancer two years ago, noted, “is the most deafening sound” for many of the women and families affected.“I don’t know what was worse – the day Irene died or the day I found out she could have lived,” Mr Teap told the meeting, referring to the day he learned her cervical cancer had been missed by two smear tests. “None of us wants to be part of this scandal.”Six months on since Vicky Phelan’s court settlement blew the lid on the botched audit of the CervicalCheck programme, it is clear that for many of the women involved, the hurt is undiminished.Galway woman Lorraine Walsh says she has drawn comfort in dealing with her cancer diagnosis from the support she has received from her fellow women and families involved in this “disaster”.“The day I found out I had cancer was what I thought was the worst day of my life. I was wrong the day I found out that I shouldn’t have got cancer had my smear been read properly was the worst day of my life.“I am now riddled every day with the awful thoughts of ‘what if?’ which has shaken me to my very core and challenged me mentally and emotionally beyond any physical or emotional challenges that I ever experienced before.”“It has been traumatic for all of us,” Ms Phelan remarked, though the women involved have been affected in “221 different ways”.“There was harm done to women. We all have been harmed and traumatised by the failure of the CervicalCheck programme.“Often people ask me, ‘You’re terminally ill, how come you are not crying and sad? How are you doing what you’re doing?’ I can only explain it by saying I have a new sense of purpose. This gives me purpose, that’s what I’m put here for.”A patently optimistic and analytical woman, Ms Phelan has attempted to process the enormity of her fate by following best practice for coping with trauma. With the shock of the original revelation of her cancer and her misread tests behind her, she has moved on to action and “meaning-making”.“I never saw myself as a campaigner. If you told me six months ago, I would have said ‘no feckin’ way’, but your heart takes over and you’re so passionate about what you’re doing that your head gets out of the way and you start talking. I haven’t stopped talking since.”Six months on, it is also clear that the full extent of the controversy may never become apparent. How many women’s slides were misread? How much negligence was involved? What difference would a different smear result have made to their health? We may never know.Even the name of the “221-plus” support group acknowledges that the exact number of women affected is not known. And may never be known, as only a minority of the group have consented to their slides being re-tested in a further review of smear tests to be carried out shortly in the UK."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663271.1539539243!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only one quarter of cervicalcheck women give consent for new review","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephen Teap, Lorraine Walsh and Vicky Phelan at the launch of 221+ in Dublin on Sunday.A support group for the 221-plus women and their families affected by the CervicalCheck controversy has held its first meeting.The 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group is funded by the Department of Health but will operate independently of the Health Service Executive.The group has been set up to represent the “known and unknown” women and families impacted by the CervicalCheck controversy by providing information, advice and support.The launch on Sunday heard presentations from some of those most prominently involved in advocating for the women, including Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap, husband of Irene Teap, who died of cervical cancer in 2017.The intiative is supported by the Irish Cancer Society, Marie Keating Foundation and Irish Patients Association. The launch in Farmleigh in Dublin was attended by about 50 women andor family members.A High Court action by Ms Phelan, from Limerick, over her cervical cancer diagnosis brought the controversy to light. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and told of the false negative in the smear test in September 2017. It later emerged that the smear tests of more than 200 women who were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer had been re-categorised after an audit but most of the women were not informed about the audit.Twenty of the women have died, including Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who was buried last Wednesday just months after making a €7.5 million court settlement for her five children with the HSE and US laboratory Quest Diagnostics. Quest admitted misreading her slides and the admission of liability by the HSE related to failing to disclose the findings of cervical cancer. The new group aims to provide practical support for women with cervical cancer and the families of women who have died from the disease. Only about 50 of the 221 women at the centre of the controversy have consented to their smear tests being re-audited in a further review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , Ms Walsh told the meeting.The RCOG report will therefore be reflective of less than one-quarter of the women, she said, adding: “I’m not sure what kind of answer we will get from RCOG”.The RCOG review, which is unlikely to be completed until spring 2019, is looking at the slides of 1,850 women in total - the 221 women who were previously audited by the HSE and a further 1,630 whose cases were reported to the National Cancer Registry after they were diagnosed with cancer. Little is known about these Registry cases but Ms Walsh said 1,060 of these cases had had no previous cytology. She said it number of these women who had not had screening was “frightening”.Ms Walsh said she had drawn comfort in dealing with her cancer diagnosis from the support she has received from her fellow women and families involved this disaster. “The day I found out I had cancer was what I thought was the worst day of my life! I was wrong the day I found out that I shouldn’t have got cancer had my smear been read properly was the worst day of my life!”“I am now riddled every day with the awful thoughts of `what if?’ which has shaken me to my very core and challenged me mentally and emotionally beyond any physical or emotional challenges that I ever experienced before.” A scoping inquiry into the controversy by public health doctor Dr Gabriel Scally last month made a number of recommendations on how the Minister for Health and his officials should interact with the affected women and their families.Dr Scally said the Minister should give consideration to how women’s health issues can be give more consistent attention within the health system. He also said the Department of Health should examine current arrangements for patients to have access to their hospital medical records. Dr Scally has also called for compensation to be paid to the women."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663509.1539551125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vicky phelan calls for laws making health managers accountable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCampaigner Vicky Phelan:  ‘We’re living in a country where people think they can get away with it at a management level and not be sanctioned.’ Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireWomen impacted by the CervicalCheck controversy have called for the introduction of new laws making managers in the public service accountable for the errors they make.Unless the law is changed, “we are going to keep having scandals of this nature again and again and people will not be held accountable,” Vicky Phelan, the Limerick woman whose court settlement last April brought the controversy to light, warned.Ms Phelan was speaking at the launch on Sunday of a new support group for the 221-plus women affected by the controversy. The 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group, funded by the Department of Health for three years, will provide expertise and advice to the women, all of whom have been diagnosed with cervical cancer, and their families.Only about 50 of the 221-plus women have consented to their smear tests being re-audited in a Government-ordered review being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) in the UK, the meeting heard.Some of the women have been advised not to give consent because their lawyers fear it may prove difficult to retrieve their slides afterwards for use in future litigation. The low consent rate means the review will struggle to establish how many women had their slides misread and what difference this made to their medical outcomes.Ms Phelan said she still felt it was correct that HSE director general Tony O’Brien and CervicalCheck clinical director Dr Grainne Flannelly stood down as a result of the controversy. However, she accepted that there wasn’t a cover-up “as such”.Group member Lorraine Walsh said the group would wait and see what came out of the further investigations being carried out by Dr Gabriel Scally, the public health doctor who carried out a scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck controversy, before deciding whether further investigations were needed.“There are a lot of answers still to be answered. We’re pressing a pause button on deciding on a commission until we see what we get” from Dr Scally’s further work and the RCOG review,said Ms Walsh.Ms Phelan was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and told of the false negative in the smear test in September 2017. It later emerged that the smear tests of more than 200 women who were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer had been re-categorised after an audit, but most of the women were not informed about the audit.Twenty of these women have died of their cancer, and Sunday’s meeting observed a minute’s silence in memory of them.Meanwhile, the State is set to take over the operation of a large part of the smear test examination services for the CervicalCheck programme.All-night talks on Friday between the HSE and two laboratories currently providing the service resulted in agreement that about 15 staff of MedLab Pathology would be offered positions in the Irish public service.

She says her work provides an “opportunity to explore the Border without entering into Brexit politics” .From California close to the Mexican border where US president Donald Trump is intent on having a wall built, she does not like such firm separations.“The Border is a huge concern. For me personally the idea of a hard border and a wall is an anathema. I don’t want to go into politics here but I think it is ridiculous,” she says.The people who participated in the film donned yellow jackets, flew yellow kites, paddled in yellow kayaks and had horses tracing a yellow track along the Border to demonstrate the special nature of the 500km boundary.In one scene, dozens of people, again dressed in yellow, walked to and danced at the bridge between Pettigo in Co Donegal and Tullyhommon in Co Fermanagh.So, what is it all about and why the yellow motif? “It represents the yellow gorse than runs through the fields and through the countryside. We are looking at the idea of a border without assigning politics to it. There is no orange, no green, no red, no blue,” she explains.Ms Lacy also was trying to reflect how border people are somehow different. “They are used to navigating a border whether it is hard or soft. If you have ever driven around there you will know you can go almost imperceptibly from one country to another. You only know where you are by your mobile phone service changing,” she says.“People carry purses with two kinds of money – sterling and euro. They have different lifestyles. I don’t know if they are a distinct people but they have distinct characteristics,” adds Ms Lacy.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":null,"title":"backing telegraphs campaign capitalism","story":"We must celebrate the achievements of entrepreneursRisk-taking is vital to Britain\u0027s economy At the heart of the capitalist system is a simple piece of human psychology.

But when her Boko Haram handler escorted her to the target, she recognised faces in the crowd as former neighbours. She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. Here I can at least meet other people who\u0027ve had the same problems.A \u0026#34conflict resolution\u0026#34 class at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Bakassi refugee camp in MaiduguriTo date, the Neem Foundation has helped more than 7,000 people affected by Boko Haram, some via a special counselling on wheels service that sends staff out to remoter areas. How successful it will be, only time will tell, although Dr Akilu does already have an endorsement from one important source.During her time working with Boko Haram\u0027s jailed commanders, she persuaded one of the group\u0027s chief imams to back her program, after months of fiery debate about different interpretations of Islam.  He was one of the main leaders who opposed Western education, but halfway through the program, he changed his mind and decided he\u0027d been misleading people. she said. He asked if we could get his children into school, which we did, and now that he\u0027s been freed from prison, he\u0027s gone back to school too.The names of some interviewees have been changed.Newsletter promotion -

the biggest targets.”The new school, Scholar 6, aims to charge parents around £13,000-a-year and will cut down on costs by partnering with clubs and societies in the local area rather than building its own state-of-the-art facilities.It will also make full use of technology, for example, by using online, interactive textbooks and by having a virtual library rather than incur the cost of building, running and staffing a bricks and mortar library.Mr Francis, a former headmaster at Hampton Court House School, said he believes there has been  “lack of imagination” among private schools about affordability.“We are just a bit sceptical about that whole money hungry process of development funds, selling brands abroad - these schools seem to be living beyond their means,” he said.Can\u0026#039t afford private school? Here\u0026#039s how one family got £330,000 of education for freeSchools with huge administrative, finance and HR departments are “at odds with 21st century business practice”, he said, since many of these can be outsourced at a low cost.Mr Francis and his colleagues aim to set up a new school for 250 sixth-form students in London by 2020. If successful, they hope to open a handful more in the capital, followed other Scholar 6 sixth forms in major cities around the country including Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham and Manchester.Neil Croally, a Classics teacher and head of scholarship at Dulwich College who has been involved with the Scholar 6 project for the past year, said the new school would have a strongly academic ethos and would focus on delivering “high quality education”.A book published earlier this year by the former High Master of St Paul’s Boys’ School claimed that private schools’ “corporate greed” is pricing out middle-class families.Dr Martin Stephen suggested that charging ever-rising school fees is short sighted, as it poses a threat to the existence of public schools.His book, titled The English Public School, Dr Stephen warned that while public schools are “highly resilient, they are not immortal”.Please review our commenting policyLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowComment: The EU are treating us with naked contempt - we must abandon this surrender of our countryComment: If only we still had a leader like Churchill, who actually talked to Britain Former Police Scotland chief \u0026#39handed new role\u0026#39 after misconduct claimsThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendDonald Trump says climate change not hoax, but takes aim at \u0026#39political agenda\u0026#39 of scientistsFree bus pass funding becoming \u0026#39nearly impossible\u0026#39 for councils, warns the LGA as journeys fall to 12 year lowTobacco sales reps using \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 tactics to sell their wares in pubsComment: We are not bluffing - we would never gamble with the UnionDuke and Duchess of Sussex follow in Queen\u0026#39s footsteps on tour Down UnderMedicinal cannabis should be available for all NHS patients, campaigners sayCookery classes and a call from the postman to stop lonelinessEx-ministers should be held to account for failed policies, says think tankRemains of British Korean War dead may never be foundCaroline Flint says Labour could back Theresa May in the Commons in order to avoid a no-deal BrexitNo 10 turns on the charm to clinch MPs\u0026#39 backing for Brexit Folic acid will be added to flour to prevent birth defectsTheresa May puts brakes on customs union deal with Brussels amid Cabinet oppositionEuropean Commission is putting paedophiles\u0026#39 privacy ahead of fighting online child abuse, charity heads sayComment: Thankfully, Strictly\u0026#39s viewers keep it about the dancingRichard Curtis wanted to cast Alan Rickman in Four Weddings because he thought Hugh Grant was \u0026#39annoying, too good-looking and a bit posh\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000177799053_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"thankfully strictlys viewers keep dancing","story":"Katya Jones and Seann Walsh on Strictly Come Dancing as the programme scored its highest ratings of the series so far as more than 10 million viewers tuned in to watch them perform their \u0026#34Dance of Shame\u0026#34Well that was a rumba do and no mistake.

- Which? says: “Our latest consumer research shows that most people are unprepared for what \u0027no deal\u0027 would mean in practice - and many do not understand how it would have multiple impacts across so many aspects of their daily lives.“When the everyday repercussions and government\u0027s plans on issues such as food and medical supplies were explained to people in our research, many people were shocked and questioned why they had not been made aware of the implications sooner.”A survey for the watchdog found three quarters of people thought it was likely a no-deal Brexit would lead to higher prices for food and other items (76 per cent) and delays at the border for travellers and holidaymakers (75 per cent).McVey refuses to back May\u0027s Brexit plan ahead of crunch cabinet talksBrexit running on ‘naivety’, says former UK ambassador to EUTheresa May faces ministers as DUP threaten alliance over BrexitThree quarters (75 per cent) also thought no deal would make it harder to resolve an issue with a faulty product bought online from an EU-based business, while 70 per cent believed it would be more difficult to rely on protections in a European country if travel companies collapse.Which? director of policy Caroline Normand said: “Consumers want a Brexit that protects and enhances their rights and gives them access to a wider range of high-quality, affordable goods and services.“But it\u0027s clear that many are deeply concerned about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for families and businesses across Britain.“From grounded flights and delays at borders and airports, to food shortages and soaring energy prices, the impact could be immediate and catastrophic for millions of people, with disruption on a scale not seen since the consumer chaos of the 1970s.“The Government must agree a deal with the European Union to prevent a disaster scenario for consumers that hits them in the pocket and sees valuable rights effectively snatched away from them.”Populus surveyed 2,056 UK adults online between August 3-5 and 2,100 UK adults online between 19-20 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.Burrington Combe, Mendips\u0026nbsp(Archie Miles)It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit. The Ash Project was conceived and is managed by the unit.

Andrew Grice\u0026nbspasks whether the dominance of big tech is now imperilling our democratic system and considers what can be done about itClick to followThe IndependentAllegations of state-sponsored interference in foreign elections have changed the gameWhen Theresa May called a surprise election last year Labour rushed out a manifesto which proved remarkably popular. There was, however, a hole at its heart. Plans to renationalise the rail, water and parts of the energy industry had a backward-looking feel, and Labour had nothing to say about the new oligopolies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.That is one reason why Jeremy Corbyn was keen to take on the digital giants in his speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival in August, proposing that the BBC receive a “digital licence fee” funded by a tax on tech companies or internet service providers. The Labour leader, who said his party faces “greater hostility from\u0026nbspthe mainstream media than we’ve probably ever had before”, inevitably faced media criticism for some of his ideas – not least in respect of a proposed expansion of\u0026nbsp“public service journalism”, funded by tech firms, which sceptics doubted would be free from political interference.But Corbyn’s proposals on the tech multinationals were well timed and reflect a changing public and political mood. In July, Facebook was fined the maximum £500,000 by the UK Information Commissioner after its data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Vote Leave was fined £61,000 and referred to the police after the Electoral Commission ruled that it exceeded its £7m spending limit by channelling £675,000 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. It must be added that it denies the claim.I’m leaving Facebook – and it’s not because of Cambridge AnalyticaIn the same month, the cross-party Digital,\u0026nbspCulture, Media and Sport Select Committee produced a devastating critique of the new media landscape. Damian Collins, its Tory chair, warned that democracy itself is at risk. The committee proposed that social media sites be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors and recommended a “clear legal liability” for tech companies which failed to act against harmful and illegal content.For the past 36 years, I’ve had a ringside seat at the often bruising battles between politicians and the media\u0026nbspthe last 20 of them while working for The Independent. When I became a Westminster-based journalist in 1982, the remnants of a much more deferential age were still evident. The questions we asked were a little more probing than the “is there anything you’d like to say today, prime minister?” style of interrogation that was evident in the 1950s, when television news was launched. But the male-dominated club of parliamentary lobby journalists I joined was unnecessarily secretive. “Maintain the mystique,” one veteran political editor told me.It was an open secret that the Downing Street press secretary – then Bernard Ingham for Margaret Thatcher – briefed the lobby daily. But we were not allowed to quote Number 10 such briefings had to be attributed to “Whitehall sources”. The archaic system would eventually change, with The Independent among those championing reform after its launch in 1986.The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always thereThe lobby has many critics. Yet if it was scrapped today, it would re-emerge in a different guise tomorrow politicians and the media need each other, and they need to talk, however strained the relationship. The lobby is not perfect, and still too dominated by men. But some criticism is overdone. Conspiracy theorists on the left recently claimed the existence of a Press Gallery WhatsApp group showed how the lobby pack agrees the line to take on stories. At the time, the group was discussing smelly towels left in the showers and the price of crisps in our canteen.Much is also made of anonymous briefings by politicians and their advisers. But if these were abolished and all statements were on the record, many would be so bland as to be worthless. It is the journalist’s job to find out what’s going on people are more willing to talk without having their names attached to a quote: such discussions will always take place. Jeremy Corbyn’s team often relies on such briefings. Do spin doctors abuse this system and lie? Occasionally, but less than you might think journalists have long memories and won’t believe them next time if they get caught.The inevitable “poacher versus gamekeeper” relationship between media and politicians has changed markedly during my time at Westminster – and it’s changed for the worse, with both sides being to blame. The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there. When I joined the lobby, old hands told me: “Right-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to the Conservative Party. And left-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to… the Conservative Party as well!”What’s shifted is that some national newspapers have crossed a line, becoming players on the political stage rather than impartial analysts. The iding line between news and comment has become blurred, and in some cases invisible. It was as if the papers, hit by declining circulations – which fell from a combined 14.8 million in 1983 to 5.9 million last year – decided to shout louder to grab people’s attention. The launch from 1989 of the 24-hour television news channels – first Sky, then a BBC offering – meant the papers were no longer first with the news, and sometimes became more focused on infotainment than information.The growing influence of TV and the decline of newspapers was made clear when the UK belatedly held its first televised election debates between party leaders at the 2010 general election. The debates dominated press coverage as soon as one debate ended, the papers previewed the next. Nevertheless, the political spin doctors continue to fret 247 about what the papers say, because they often still set the broadcasters’ agenda.Some elements of the press, particularly on the right, have given news an opinionated twist, and has become less reliable as a result. There’s no doubt that hostile, often inaccurate, coverage of the European Union – and underreporting about the benefits of membership – played a critical role in the decision to hold the 2016 referendum and in the result.By then (if not before), some papers had crossed a line between healthy scepticism about politics and its practitioners to unhealthy cynicism. In 2009, The Daily  was absolutely right to expose abuses of the MPs’ expenses system but there has been a feeding frenzy ever since: a misleading presumption that MPs are in it for themselves. In my view, this has gone too far, fuelling in turn public cynicism and a lack of trust in politicians – though it’s also true to say they contributed to this by trying to spin their way out of troubles they had made themselves.MPs’ expenses claims, including for Peter Viggers’ infamous duck house, had a huge impact on public trust\u0026nbsp(AP)At the 1992 election, Neil Kinnock, a modernising Labour leader, faced a barrage of highly personal abuse and criticism in the Tory tabloids. The Sun’s front page on polling day declared that if Kinnock won, “will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” The Sun claimed to have “won it” when the Conservatives were re-elected but the truth was that Rupert Murdoch liked to back the winner (and be seen to have done so) to maximise his influence.Scarred by Kinnock’s treatment, Tony Blair made a sea change when he became Labour leader two years later. He told me: “I’m not going to let them do to me what they did to Neil. Never again.” In Blair’s view, that meant supping with the devil. He flew halfway round the world to address a conference held by Murdoch in Australia. Blair once said: “It is better to ride the back of a tiger than let it rip your throat out.”The cosying up was accompanied by a much more aggressive response to negative media reports about Labour – there would be a “rapid rebuttal” or even “pre-buttal” when the party got wind of a potentially damaging story. New Labour spin doctors put pressure on journalists, with threats such as “you’ll never get another interview or exclusive if you write this” they complained behind reporters’ backs to their editor, occasionally even demanding their removal.\u0026nbspThey doled out exclusive stories to favoured journalists or papers, though there was nothing new in that.Blair’s “hug them close” strategy worked, at least in opposition. The Sun, the country’s biggest selling paper, came out for Labour at the 1997 election (which it was bound to win in any event). In government though, New Labour became too eager to please its media enemies-turned-friends. Lance Price, who was deputy to Alastair Campbell, Blair’s communications director, said “no major decision could be taken by the government without first assessing the reaction of three people”:\u0026nbspGordon Brown, the chancellor John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and Murdoch.Spin had its limitations of course. Headline-grabbing works in opposition, when the media is your main weapon but in power, New Labour discovered that headlines were no substitute for policy or action. Spin would also, in the end, contribute to Blair’s demise and help to tarnish his legacy. In 2003, he discovered that you cannot spin the case for war, when it is based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.As papers like The Sun tired of Blair and reverted to type, he launched an attack on the “feral beasts” of the media in one of his last speeches as prime minister. I sat in the front row, appalled that he bizarrely singled out The Independent for criticism when his real target was the Daily Mail he was still too frightened of its power to say so.David Cameron copied the New Labour playbook when he began modernising the Conservatives on becoming their leader in 2005. Mirroring Blair’s trip to Australia, Cameron flew to the Google Zeitgeist conference in San Francisco in 2007, symbolically paying homage to the new power in the media world.\u0026nbspCameron, who called Blair “the master”, faithfully adopted his top-down, centralised approach to media management, and imported it into government in 2010. The cosy relationship between leading figures in the government and media was highlighted again during the Leveson inquiry after the phone-hacking scandal.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known...When Theresa May succeeded Cameron after his ill-fated EU referendum in 2016 she set out to do everything differently. That included moving away from a rigid day-to-day “grid” of centrally controlled initiatives designed to allow the government to set the agenda. May tried to curb headline-grabbing stunts, and focus on fewer, bigger statements. It was an honest attempt to combat spin, but didn’t work in a digital age when the battle between government and media (and between parties, and even between factions within parties) had become ever faster and more frenetic. However, it is doubtful whether any administration could dictate the agenda while Brexit eclipses everything.May’s disastrous snap election last year would prove a watershed for the press. Right-wing papers reprised their 1992 treatment of Kinnock to target Corbyn, but this time – refreshingly – it didn’t work. In the age of the insurgent, already exploited by Trump and the Brexiteers, social media helped Corbyn bypass the mainstream media (the hated “MSM” in Corbynland). Friends sharing pro-Labour stories on Facebook and other social platforms proved a powerful weapon. Labour’s machine outgunned the Tories, diluting the impact of the right-leaning press.AFPGetty)However, it remains to be seen whether the old media has really been replaced by new media which, despite the early optimism about “digital democracy” during Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, seems actually to undermine rather than enhance democracy. In those days of hope, I didn’t imagine Trump tweeting from the White House at 5am about the “fake news media” and journalists who are “the enemy of the people”.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known – no coincidence when filter bubbles create echo chambers that reinforce our own views. The abuse hurled around on Twitter, between fellow party members as well as opponents, is nasty, often misogynistic and sometimes racist. It scars our politics.At the 2017 election, parties spent more than 40 per cent of their advertising budgets online. During the EU referendum, Vote Leave devoted 98 per cent of its ad spend to digital, much on highly targeted “dark” ads which no one but the recipients could see. It ran a last-minute blitz claiming falsely: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Our schools and hospitals already can’t cope!”The social media ads used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever inventedThe tech giants have been slow to put their house in order, and politicians slow to force them. While claiming to be platforms rather than publishers, they have often paid little tax in countries where they made vast profits. They have demolished the economic model of newspapers by gobbling up much of their advertising revenue. Some 300 local papers have closed in the UK in the past 10 years, undermining democracy at local levePoliticians want to sound modern and offer a vision of the future. But Tom Baldwin, a former political journalist who was Ed Miliband’s communications director, believes they do not understand the new technology and are afraid to regulate the new giants roaming the media landscape. In a revealing and thoughtful new book covering politics on both sides of the Atlantic, Ctrl Alt Delete, published by Hurst, Baldwin argues that the new information age “has unpicked truth and hollowed out space for a virulent new strain of populism to spread like a contagion across all forms of media”. He says: “The social media ads that were used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented.”What, then, needs to be done? The government plans to require an imprint showing the identity of those running digital ads, and a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners. But it will need to go much further to ensure a system of\u0026nbspelectoral law brought in for an analogue era is fit for a fast-evolving digital age.Created with Sketch.11 useful Facebook features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Clean up your News FeedMost of us are Facebook friends with some people we don’t actually care about, and there are several ways to keep their updates off your News Feed.

They could be funded by a levy on the tech giants. There should be a statutory code of practice covering the use of personal data by political campaigns. All political ads should be published in some sort of central register so that everyone can see them. In election periods, ads should be limited to registered campaigns, following evidence of Russian interference in the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.There is rising political support for a ban on online political ads, to bring the internet into line with broadcast media. It extends from Baldwin on the left to William Hague, the former Tory leader, on the right. This would help to stop those with the deepest pockets enjoying an unfair advantage, but would not prevent videos being shared.For a government consumed by Brexit, such reforms might not look like a priority. But with growing evidence that our democracy is under threat, the task is urgent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The worst thing we have to worry about is repetitive strain syndrome and drinking too much coffee. But there is a heroic hardcore who are willing to put themselves in the way of harm to tell the story.Writing about certain presidents and princes can be bad for your health. In Michael Scott Moore’s case, it was pirates. He was doing research into pirates, so like any decent reporter worth his salt he thought he should go and interview one. What happened next you can read about in his new book, The Desert and the Sea. The clue is in the subtitle: 977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast.What image springs to mind when you think of pirates? Johnny Depp? An eye-patch? A cutlass? For me, it’s more an adjective – “swashbuckling”. Criminals of the high seas, of course, but romantic daredevils, skilled swordsmen, daring nomadic outsiders, surely. Michael Scott Moore has finally put paid to any lingering remnants of the myth by way of being kidnapped by them and held hostage for nearly three years, driven to the brink of madness, malaria and suicide by “a stupid and self-aggrandising pirate society, a suicidal culture in which gunshots rang in the street and gunmen were winners”.UK investigates reports of looting of sunken WW2 shipsMoore was a surfer – and author of Sweetness and Blood, a history of American expansionism after the Second World War, seen through the turquoise lens of surfing –\u0026nbspwho naturally felt a certain rapport with the men who make their living off the sea. And he felt that piracy was not exactly unknown in American history. “North America,” Moore writes, “had evolved from an underdeveloped haven for pirates to an antipirate world power within three generations.”Hobyo (Courtesy of Michael Scott Moore)I saw him before he left for Somalia – hale and hearty – and I went to see him again recently, in a cafe in West Village, New York, several years later, after he got back, now 49, looking like a war veteran, wounded, skinnier, traumatised, but a survivor. Older and wiser. He had planned to write a book about Somali pirates that would be pure reportage, “but,” he says, “it became more personal from the moment I got kidnapped”.\u0026nbspWhen you’re held hostage your entire life up to that moment keeps replaying itself in your head. His father, Bert Moore, was an aerospace engineer and alcoholic who committed suicide when Michael was aged 12. His mother told him it was a heart attack. He only found out what really happened 30 years later when he asked for a copy of the death certificate that read: “Gunshot\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspleft chest”. He had been kicked out of the family home in the suburbs of Los Angeles by Mrs Moore. After a year of trying to get sober he shot himself. Mother and son went to live in Redondo Beach, where he started surfing.abc)When his first marriage fell apart, Mike left his old southern Californian life behind and set up in Berlin. Somehow he ended up writing about pirate activities for Spiegel Online International and attended the trial of 10 pirates in Hamburg, in 2011. It was the first trial of pirates on German soil for 400 years. They had been arrested after a gun battle with Dutch commandos while trying to hijack a German ship.“I was as full of pirate romance as the next American kid” says Moore. He knew that\u0026nbspPirates of the Caribbean was pure Hollywood. But still he wanted to find out what they were really like. Moore had been to the Horn of Africa before –\u0026nbspon a counter-piracy vessel, a Turkish warship.But in January 2012, supported by a couple of magazines and a grant from the Pulitzer Centre\u0026nbspon Crisis Reporting, he set off again, without a warship this time. To be on the safe side he had tried to get kidnap insurance and been turned down. But he wasn’t naive. He knew he was in “a country where no one could save me if things went wrong”. He had security. “Good security”, as he describes it. The problem was that at the crucial moment they “disappeared”. They sold him out. He was paying them well, but the pirates were paying them more. And they were part of the same clan. “That particular clan was supposed to be hosting and protecting me,” he says with an ironic grin.He interviewed a pirate called Mustaf in a flyblown restaurant in Hobyo where he had to pay $620 for lunch.

On 22 August, 27 unaccompanied minors were let off from the ship, assisted by Red Cross, UNHCR and Save the ChildrenOne of the pirates had the cheek to say to him, as if it was all his fault, “You have made a mistake.”\u0026nbspIt is a phrase that haunts him even to this day. For a long while in captivity, he felt the pirates were right about that: “I was a tall, white man hoping to make friends with pirates. Crazy.”\u0026nbspBeing a writer meant that he was worth something. “I have seen you on the internet,” said one of his captors. “You are famous.”\u0026nbspHe denied it. Then they fished out a picture of him that had appeared in the New York Times. I had even contributed in a small way to adding to the price on his head by writing an enthusiastic review of his surfing book in that newspaper. The asking price was $20m. If only I’d slated his book it might have brought the price down by a few million. His friends soon learned he had been kidnapped but we were warned not to write anything. Every time his name was mentioned on the BBC his price went up again.He was regularly beaten, and threatened with torture, or being handed over to al-Shabaab, but one of the worst things about being held in captivity is not having anything to read. One of the highlights of his first few months was piecing together fragments of The Gulf News\u0026nbspwhich had been wrapping up samosas. Taken to a ship a mile offshore, the Naham 3 – a highjacked fishing vessel – he was given a Bible by one of his fellow hostages. A lapsed Catholic, he read it twice from cover to cover, having to squint all the while, but finding consolation in “the gritty survival ethic” of the Old Testament. He decided he was not so keen on crucifixion as such.There were a lot of guards on the ship, and a fair few sharks in the water too. And without glasses he could barely make out where he was going. But in the end he leapt off the ship in a bid for freedom. He didn’t make it and spent the next three\u0026nbspweeks chained up in solitary confinement. I read a story online about how he had been shot while trying to escape. This turned out to be a myth put about by the pirates themselves, with a notion of speeding up delivery of the ransom.Around this time Moore devoutly wished he had become an astronaut – or anything – rather than a writer. As a kid, his bedroom had been decorated with astronaut wallpaper, peppered with rockets and moons and stars. Now marooned on board a very terrestrial ship, he was tormented by dreams and rumours of a rescue that never came. But there was still one option available to him. He could try and shoot his way out. It would be the heroic thing to do. But it would also be stupid. The guards had a habit of leaving their Kalashnikovs lying about. There was zero chance of getting away but he could go out in a blaze of glory and bullets, and maybe take a pirate or two down with him. “I was angry enough to pick up a Kalashnikov,” he says.Rolly Tambara, who were held in captivity together (Seychelles Nation)The thing that stopped him was the memory of his father’s suicide. His logic was that he didn’t want his mother to have to bear witness to both the men in her life self-destructing. His mother becomes one of the heroes of the book. German in origin, Marlis was still playing tennis and golf, and was due to have lunch at a Mexican restaurant when five men in suits (unheard of in Redondo Beach) turned up at her door. Schooled by the FBI, she had to conduct ransom negotiations herself over the phone, driving the price down from $20m\u0026nbspto $8m, then down to $5m, and finally $1.5m. In the end she recruited a mercenary to deliver $700,000, which she\u0026nbspmanaged to cobble together from different sources, friends, family and Der Spiegel.“I’m still angry,” Michael says, “about losing more than two years of my life.” But he had to rein in his anger if he wanted to live. When he explained he needed a doctor for his broken wrist the trigger-happy guard said to him, “You mean it was broken in this operation.” He was tempted to reply, “No motherf***er, I’m in the habit of walking around Somalia with a broken wrist.” “Yes” is how he chooses – rather carefully – to phrase it.He developed friendships with the other hostages – Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Filipinos –and he came around to liking some of the guards. But he was never tempted by Stockholm syndrome: “I went through a long period of wanting to kill them.” Notably one guy by the name of Ali.Werne)Sometimes your reading can save your life. In Moore’s case it was Epictetus, the great stoic philosopher. Stoicism says that you can’t do a lot about your fate, but you can control your attitude towards it. Epictetus asks the question, what do you do if your servant drops your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces? Do you lash out and whip the servant, or do you say – which is what he recommends – “the vase has been restored”. Moore grits his teeth and develops a sense of humour about his predicament. “Not that I laughed every day.”\u0026nbspWhen he was staring down the barrel of a gun, quite literally, he learned to sit and accept the prospect of a sudden death. “I had to train my mind for actual non-existence.”As well as ancient Greek philosophers, a collection of Tom and Jerry cartoons definitely helps. As does news, on a short-wave radio, of the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, when Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final.\u0026nbspThere is an ironic twist in Moore’s story, when most of the people who tormented him for so long are annihilated, in a way he could never have anticipated, but which reflects what he writes about the rise of “factionalism and violent opportunism”. One further irony:\u0026nbspwhen he gets free he even has one of his former captors becoming a Facebook “friend”.Disney removes bride auction scene on ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ ride‘Porch pirates’ steal 4-year-old boy’s supply of life-saving medicineMaybe he could have made it as an astronaut, but he is the most persistent and unstoppable of writers. He simply stole a pen and paper from the pirates and wrote about his experiences, like a Solzhenitsyn of the Somali gulag. But these samizdats never see the light of day. When his guards read their own names they confiscate his notebooks, again and again. Finally he realises his only way out is fiction. He sets his novel in southern California, not in Somalia. About a quixotic innocent who is kidnapped by bad guys. It was partly allegory, to remind him of what happened, but now it’s in danger of becoming his next book.For Michael Scott Moore, writing is therapy, a way of retaining sanity. “To put painful events into a certain order, I had to find a way through it. The easiest thing was to set down what happened.”I asked him what he missed most during his 977 days. “I’m not sure there was any one thing. Beer? Fresh fruit? Above all my family and friends.

has said.The consumer group said the government\u0027s preparations for a no-deal exit suggested a reduction in consumer rights and choice as well as price hikes that would have a “direct and hard” impact in areas ranging from travel to food and energy.The watchdog, which based its conclusions on its assessment of the government\u0027s technical notices in preparation for the event of a no-deal Brexit, online forums and surveys, said two in five people did not understand the potential implications of a no-deal scenario.Health department cannot guarantee \u0027supply of medicines\u0027 after BrexitIn its report - Brexit no deal: a consumer catastrophe? - Which? says: “Our latest consumer research shows that most people are unprepared for what \u0027no deal\u0027 would mean in practice - and many do not understand how it would have multiple impacts across so many aspects of their daily lives.“When the everyday repercussions and government\u0027s plans on issues such as food and medical supplies were explained to people in our research, many people were shocked and questioned why they had not been made aware of the implications sooner.”A survey for the watchdog found three quarters of people thought it was likely a no-deal Brexit would lead to higher prices for food and other items (76 per cent) and delays at the border for travellers and holidaymakers (75 per cent).McVey refuses to back May\u0027s Brexit plan ahead of crunch cabinet talksBrexit running on ‘naivety’, says former UK ambassador to EUTheresa May faces ministers as DUP threaten alliance over BrexitThree quarters (75 per cent) also thought no deal would make it harder to resolve an issue with a faulty product bought online from an EU-based business, while 70 per cent believed it would be more difficult to rely on protections in a European country if travel companies collapse.Which? director of policy Caroline Normand said: “Consumers want a Brexit that protects and enhances their rights and gives them access to a wider range of high-quality, affordable goods and services.“But it\u0027s clear that many are deeply concerned about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for families and businesses across Britain.“From grounded flights and delays at borders and airports, to food shortages and soaring energy prices, the impact could be immediate and catastrophic for millions of people, with disruption on a scale not seen since the consumer chaos of the 1970s.“The Government must agree a deal with the European Union to prevent a disaster scenario for consumers that hits them in the pocket and sees valuable rights effectively snatched away from them.”Populus surveyed 2,056 UK adults online between August 3-5 and 2,100 UK adults online between 19-20 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But when they do so they will most likely see the library of the country they are in, as happens if Britons travel outside of the European Union now.“UK Netflix subscribers are able to access Netflix everywhere in the world Netflix is available and will continue to do so once the UK leaves the EU,” a Netflix spokesperson said. The company said that “local catalogues vary due to licensing and local tastes”, but pointed out its original shows are available everywhere.The new papers also make clear that the same regulations would apply to geo-blocking regulation. That ensures that people can buy from online services across the continent, without being punished for doing so from another country.“Following repeal of the Geo-Blocking Regulation in the UK, traders from the UK, EU and third countries would not be prohibited from discriminating between EU customers and UK customers,” the papers say.“For instance a UK trader would be able to offer different terms to a UK customer compared to a French customer.”Companies based in the UK and selling products and services in the EU\u0026nbspwill still have to comply with the regulation, to ensure that they don’t discriminate between people in different countries within Europe.The new geo-blocking rules go into effect in December 2018, meaning that they will apply to UK citizens for about\u0026nbspthree months before a possible no-deal Brexit in March 2019.The paper covering ‘Geo-blocking of online content if there’s no Brexit deal’ and another covering portability of content\u0026nbspis one of a range of papers released in the latest set of documents from the UK government. They also include new documents showing Britain could no longer benefit from deals that represent a significant portion of UK trade and that train journeys into and out of the EU could be disrupted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But, as part of ongoing austerity measures, they have been frozen since April 2016, resulting in a decline in\u0026nbsptheir real term value while inflation rises.Now, if this year’s inflation reaches the predicted 2.7 per cent when revealed on Wednesday, it will mean the worth of working age benefits has fallen by an astonishing 6.4 per cent over the last four years.The foundation says some 10 million people will be affected, and called on the government to use the upcoming budget to cancel the freeze.Adam Corlett, its senior economic analyst, said: While the prime minister this week repeated her claim that austerity is over, significant cuts in support for millions of low-income families are set to continue next year as a result of the ongoing freeze in working age benefits.The budget represents a last chance to cut short the benefit freeze. Scrapping it would send a strong signal that, from the perspective of low-income families, the government is committed to ending austerity.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jeremy Hunt hosting eastern European Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Secretary\u0027s official country residence ahead of tomorrow\u0027s meetings at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg where chemical weapons sanctions will be formally adoptedPolice stop a breakaway from the main Football Lads alliance march, as they attempt to get close to a rival anti-facist demonstration in LondonWaves hit Cawsand, Cornwall as Storm Callum arrives to the UKFormer Prime Minister John Major has spoken out against the launch of Universal Credit (the Government\u0027s new benefit model).

Work and pensions secretary Esther McVey has reportedly told cabinet colleagues the changes would effect two-thirds of working age couples with children.A Government spokesman said: We\u0027re committed to providing families with the support they need, which is why we spend £90 billion a year on working age benefits, and we will be spending £28 billion more on all welfare by 2022 than we do now.The reality is that there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010, including 300,000 fewer children.At the same time, we have supported more people into work, introduced the national living wage, doubled free childcare and helped workers keep more of the money they earn at the end of every month by cutting taxes for 31 million people.But Margaret Greenwood, Labour\u0027s shadow work and pension secretary, said: This is yet more shocking evidence that Theresa May is failing to keep her promise to end austerity.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open, including the backstop for IENI to avoid a hard border.”Mr Barnier said he would debrief the 27 remaining EU states and the European Parliament on the state of the negotiations.No further negotiations are planned before European leaders including Theresa May meet for a further summit in Brussels\u0026nbspon Wednesday, according to a senior EU diplomat.“Despite constructive and intensive negotiations, several key issues remain unresolved,” one senior EU diplomat said. “No further negotiations are planned ahead of the European Council. The EU negotiator will brief the leaders who will then assess the progress so far.”Mr Barnier’s announcement immediately deflated\u0026nbspspeculation of a breakthrough in the difficult negotiations, following Mr Raab’s surprise trip to Brussels and the summoning\u0026nbspof ambassadors to a meeting at EU headquarters.Both sides had indicated they want to sign off on a draft withdrawal agreement to set out the terms of Britain’s orce from the EU.One of the most pressing issues is the Northern Irish backstop,\u0026nbspa mechanism to avoid a hard border.The EU’s version of the backstop, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels’ rules, has been called unacceptable by Ms May and is loathed by her DUP allies.Ms May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole of the UK, but Tory Brexiteers fear this could become an open-ended position which would prevent free trade deals with countries around the world.Created with Sketch.

There are still some big issues to settle. We are putting everything into trying to resolve these issues.\u0026nbspHe said Brexit secretary Dominic Raab was taking part in last-minute talks to try to see if progress could be made on outstanding issues and this was a sign of how much effort we are putting in.\u0026nbspMr Hunt said he spoke with eight European counterparts about Brexit during a reception at the house in the afternoon and there was a huge desire to resolve these issues, adding: People want to end up with a relationship where Britain and Europe are friends and that\u0027s really what we are all working very hard to try to achieve.\u0026nbspAsked if it was now time for the Prime Minister to rethink her strategy, particularly involving discussions on the Irish border, Mr Hunt said: Theresa May has been absolutely clear that she would not sign up to indefinite membership of a customs union so what we need to do is find a backstop solution that respects her commitment to be leaving the customs union but also satisfies Irish concerns that we would never return to the Troubles.\u0026nbspWhen asked for his response to comments from David Davis calling for an open revolt against the Prime Minister, Mr Hunt said: I would say that\u0027s wrong and the reason that\u0027s wrong is there is no-one who is going to be able to negotiate the right deal for Britain better than Theresa May. She is battling for Britain.\u0026nbspThis is the crucial stage of the negotiations. We can get there, I believe we will get there. But this is the time to stand rock solid behind Theresa May, to back our Prime Minister to get the best deal for Britain.\u0026nbspPAThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

those of us who want to get a deal - are sometimes stuck between a rock and a hard place between hardline Brexiteers who think we can waltz off without a deal and some hardline Remainers who, for their own reasons don\u0027t want a deal because they want to overturn the referendum results.Asked about speculation around 30 Labour MPs would be prepared to vote for a deal if it meant defying the whip, she said: I\u0027m really not sure, but I think if a reasonable deal is on the table the question for some of my Labour colleagues is \u0027why wouldn\u0027t you support a deal, why would you stand along (with) Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg who want us to crash out without a deal?If 15 Labour MPs\u0026nbspput their support behind the deal, the prime minister could afford a Tory rebellion of more than 20, presuming she is able to keep the Democratic Unionist Party on her\u0026nbspside.Eurosceptic Tories claim they have at least 40 MPs ready to vote down the deal, although the government hopes to whittle down that\u0026nbspnumber when pressure is applied.Many Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies feel they cannot both vote against Ms May’s deal while convincingly opposing a no-deal exit.They are torn between, on\u0026nbspthe one hand, party members who will be furious if they help prop up a Tory prime minister and, on the other, constituents who will not forgive them if they vote in a way that could appear to be frustrating Britain’s exit from the EU.“We can’t vote against the deal but also oppose no-deal without it looking very much like we’re voting against Brexit,” another said. “That isn’t an option.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Snell added: “I’m quite clear that no-deal would be an absolute disaster and therefore to avoid a no-deal outcome we’ve got to be open to supporting a deal that’s presented.“I’m not wedded to opposing a deal just because it comes from the government. If the deal is as May has been suggesting then it would be difficult for me to justify to myself not strongly considering supporting it, if the alternative is crashing out without a deal.Labour is expected to instruct its MPs to vote against Ms May’s deal, which it will say does not meet the six strict tests the party has set out.However, one MP said: “Everyone knows the six tests were designed to never be met.”Mr Corbyn and his team are likely to warn MPs how members will react if they vote with the government and help the Conservatives stay in power.They will tell MPs that voting down Ms May’s deal would either force her to return to Brussels to renegotiate a softer Brexit, or trigger a general election – a suggestion some MPs have already dismissed.“The suggestion that parliament could somehow force her to go crawling back to Brussels, or that Labour could force a general election, is nonsense,” one said.Another said Labour could not credibly oppose a deal that had the support of all 27 other EU countries. “The idea the Labour Party should block a deal that is backed by the likes of Merkel, Macron and the rest of the 27 is ludicrous.”The Labour leadership is understood to believe the fact that hardline Tory Eurosceptics will join them in the ision lobby to vote against the deal will invalidate accusations the party is frustrating Brexit – a confidence not shared by many of the party’s MPs.Potential rebels have increasingly found an unlikely ally in John McDonnell, who, MPs said, appears to be increasingly concerned about the risks of Labour being seen to vote against Brexit.MPs dismissed reports that up to 30 Labour MPs could vote with the government and suggested the number of potential rebels has been intentionally inflated by Conservative whips in an attempt to convince Tory Eurosceptics that Ms May is not reliant on their support.And despite reports that Downing Street is actively lobbying Labour rebels with a view to cobbling together a majority for Ms May’s deal, none of the Labour MPs spoken to by The Independent\u0026nbspsaid they had been approached by Tory whips.Several Labour frontbenchers are understood to\u0026nbspbe considering abstaining from the vote, effectively boosting Ms May’s chances of securing a parliamentary majority. They believe they could do this without having to resign from their positions.Labour facing fresh row after Jewish activists banned from eventMay’s pitch for centre-ground voters branded ‘desperate’ by LabourLabour ‘will be forced to keep UK in single market’, unions claimOne said: “I’m definitely not going to vote against the deal.

If it’s something like Chequers I could support that. Several of us would likely abstain.”Some MPs\u0026nbspin Leave areas are banking on a constitutional get-out clause that would give them the cover to vote for a deal. While the Labour leadership and pro-EU Tory MPs are united in insisting the choice before parliament cannot be between Ms May’s deal and no deal, some Labour MPs believe that is exactly the decision they face.Some have even sought the advice of constitutional experts in the hope of seeking credible confirmation that there would be no parliamentary mechanism for avoiding a no-deal outcome if Ms May’s deal is rejected. That would give them the justification they need to allow them to vote with the government.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They will put the 48 letters in calling for a leadership election.”Back home, the prime minister’s troubles deepened as:* Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, and Scottish secretary David Mundell, hinted they would resign if the Brexit deal gives Northern Ireland special trading terms with the EU* Up to nine cabinet ministers, including Mr Mundell, prepared to challenge the prime minister’s backstop plan at a meeting on Tuesday* The number of letters calling for the vote of confidence, sent to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, was reported to have reached 44 – just four short of the total needed* A cabinet minister admitted Ms May will not insist on an “end date” for the UK staying in the EU customs territory – increasing the risk of resignations on Tuesday* The EU said it would stage a no-deal Brexit summit in November, to prepare for the UK crashing out of the bloc, unless the UK delivered decisive progress this weekCreated with Sketch.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ide Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

It comes amid that Ms May’s former aides drew up a dossier on Mr Johnson’s sexual encounters with the aim of undermining his leadership prospects.Mr Johnson confirmed that his 25-year marriage to wife Marina had endedThe growing Brexiteer revolt appeared to have succeeded in preventing Ms May signing off on a weekend agreement that could lock the UK into the EU’s customs territory indefinitely.Cabinet ministers fear that, without a legal end date, the EU will be left to decide whether as-yet-unproven technology has produced an alternative solution to avoid the need for border checks in Ireland.And that\u0026nbspin turn\u0026nbspwould leave the UK unable to sign its own trade deals for years to come – to Leave supporters, a key prize of Brexit.Until now, Mr Davis has insisted he is campaigning to “change the plan, rather the prime minister”, heaping praise on Ms May when he resigned in July.However, a switch to seeking a Canada-style trade deal – unless accompanied by an Irish backstop – would be rejected immediately by EU and would almost certainly collapse the talks altogether.Brexit secretary makes surprise trip to Brussels for crunch talksLabour MPs say they are ready to rescue May’s Brexit dealCorbyn under fresh pressure to back a Final Say Brexit referendumMay clash with Raab over customs ‘time limit’ threatens deal hopesThe 69-year-old Mr Davis is not interested in being a caretaker prime minister who would finalise a deal with the EU and then stand down,\u0026nbspThe Independent understands.He has told friends: “I have had five people this week contacting me and trying to get me to run. Some are saying they want an interim prime minister, but nobody wants to be an interim prime minister.“It wouldn’t work. You would be a lame duck from day one. We need a powerful prime minister to lead the negotiations.”However, Mr Davis is also confident he could beat Boris Johnson in a leadership contest. “Boris is easy,” he joked to friends. “The battle is never between favourites.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Talk will increase ever more about the end of the Merkel era,” said Fred Kempe, president of the Washington-based Atlantic Council thinktank.SPD leader Andrea Nahles\u0026nbspblamed\u0026nbspher party’s loss of support on the “poor performance” of the federal government in Berlin, although she did not name Ms Merkel.“It’s clear that something has to change,” she said.Turnout increased from 64 per cent to more than 72 per cent.The CSU had been predicted to suffer heavy losses in the election, with analysts suggesting the result could pile further pressure on Chancellor Merkel, the leader of the centre-right CDU.Before the vote in Bavaria, Merkel had urged her CSU and CDU allies to end their infighting.CSU leader, interior minister Horst\u0026nbspSeehofer, has repeatedly clashed with Ms Merkel over immigration policy since 2015.Divisions between the two parties had widened further since an inconclusive national election forced them into a coalition with the\u0026nbspSPD\u0026nbspin March.The\u0026nbspCDU is also expected to lose votes in a regional election\u0026nbspin the western state of Hesse, home to the financial centre of Frankfurt, on 28 October.Ms Merkel is then\u0026nbspdue to seek re-election as CDU party chairwoman in December.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Serbia\u0027s Novak Djokovic kisses the trophy after winning his men\u0027s final singles match against Croatia\u0027s Borna Coric at the Shanghai Masters.

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The story at this time of year for the last five years has been an average autumn bounce of 1.6 per cent in the price of property coming to market.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWhilst all regions have seen a monthly rise, this year has a more subdued narrative with only a one per cent uplift. \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWhile the backdrop of political uncertainty and stretched buyer affordability remains the same, this month has price drops at the bottom of the market dragging down the national average.Property market (Image: JOHN MACDOUGALLAFPGetty Images)Miles added: \u0026ldquoWhile landlords were hit with a three per cent stamp duty surcharge on property purchases back in April 2016, in contrast most first time buyers were effectively awarded stamp duty-free status in November 2017.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe fall in prices at the bottom of the market during what is, traditionally, a busier time means that those keen to sell need to price accordingly, which gives an opportunity for those stamp duty-free first time buyers to negotiate harder.At the coal face, Robert Lazarus, MD of Paramount Properties in North West London, observed: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a better opportunity for first time buyers coming in to the market at the minute compared to a couple of years ago, especially if they\u0026rsquore looking for a one bed flat.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoBefore the additional stamp duty on second homes came in we were selling 20 per cent of these flats to landlords which was driving prices up, and now we\u0026rsquore selling less than five per cent of them to landlords, giving first time buyers the first pick of new stock that comes on.Another layer to this complex picture would be the rumoured introduction in the Autumn Budget of capital gains tax relief for landlords who sell to long-term tenants. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf true, this could generate a unique opportunity for those who want to exit the sector to work with those who want to buy, thus creating a win-win scenario for both parties.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, with latest research from the National Landlords Association suggesting that as many as a fifth of all landlords may leave the sector over the next two years, potentially removing up to 980,000 privately rented properties from the UK\u0026rsquos housing stock, the upwards pressure on rents that this shift in the market might create is not to be under-estimated.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGood news for landlords with a long-term investment view, but not so positive for those who, out of necessity, have to rent their home rather than buy.\u0026nbsp            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/1031196_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news update Iain Duncan Smith Theresa May EU summit Irish border backstop","story":"Speaking to Sky\u0027s Sophy Ridge, the leading eurosceptic claimed it was time Theresa May put the ball back into the EU\u0027s court and scrapped the Brexit backstop clause agreed in the December 2016 white paper.\u0026nbspMr Duncan Smith also urged Cabinet ministers to make their concerns very clear to the Prime Minister and avoid a little cabal outside government making their\u0026nbspdecisions.\u0026nbspHe said: \u0026ldquoI do say to anyone who is in Cabinet and has concerns about this, you have to make them very clear to the Prime Minister.\u0026ldquoWe mustn\u0026rsquot have a little cabal outside cabinet running this.

A483 traffic update: A483 CLOSED after lorry and tractor crash                 Traffic lights could soon be removed from UK roads, this is whyThe Rest and Be Thankful Woodland Creation Project was approved in August after a public consultation and the planting of up to 250,000 trees is scheduled to start in 2020.However, work cannot begin until the land is purchased from the current owner, who uses the barren slopes for rough sheep grazing.Even then, it will be at least 15 years before the new forest starts to reduce landslides in the steep-sided mountain pass between Tarbert and Arrochar.The project was first put forward in 2012 in a report for FCS by Bill Raynor and Bruce Nicoll of Forest Research in Edinburgh.They said it would not be possible to plant quick-growing conifers in such a windy location and suggested reintroducing a mix of native species that would have covered the slopes before they were cleared for sheep grazing.The species included ash, aspen, bird cherry, blackthorn, common alder, downy birch, eared willow, hawthorn, hazel, holly, rowan and sessile oak, with blaeberry and wood sorrel ground vegetation.In the same year, a report by Transport Scotland concluded that low-height broadleaf trees and shrubs should be planted alongside other measures such as deer fences and engineering work.As well as the land ownership issue, the impact on golden eagles, black grouse and badgers and concerns from hikers and mountaineers have also complicated matters since then.The SNP Government has focused instead on opening the relief route and has spent \u0026pound10million on measures such as netting, drainage and road safety works.Despite this massive outlay, the road has been closed on dozens of occasions causing long delays for motorists and the emergency services and damaging the rural economy of Argyll.Jamie Greene, Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, said the landslips caused enormous disruption and inconvenience for everyone in the local area and added: While clearly a previous attempt has been made to prevent this kind of landslip, it has not worked.

Transport Scotland has been working closely with the existing landowner and partner agencies and it is hoped these will be finalised in the near future, allowing preparatory works to begin in the new year.Work has already begun on a further \u0026pound2m worth of additional mitigation measures, including the construction of road side catch pits.\u0026ldquoThese measures, which were agreed with the A83 Taskforce, will help improve the resilience of the A83 and help keep Argyll open for business.

And try out the windbag oratory on the .million decent British democrats who voted to leave the European Union, and who have been told ever since that they are racist, ignorant ­bigots who should never be allowed near a polling booth.I like Bono. In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away. He says: “The war was a colour war. You’re seeing it as they saw it. And they saw it in colour.”World War One never felt closer. And the humour, humanity and courage of the men who fought it has never been more heartbreaking.BEST wishes for the future to Trevor Engelson and his bride Tracey Kurland, who were married in a low-key ceremony in Calornia last weekend.Andyou don’t recognise the names, that is because Mr Engelson has chosen to keep a discreet silence on the subject of his two-year marriage to Meghan Markle.And in an age where every broken relationship is ­dissected on social media, isn’t it refreshing to see a man who can keep a dignied silence “WE lost the match but won the battle,” claimed Conor McGregor after his beating in last weekend’s UFC .  What planet was that victory on then, Conor To the casual fan it looked like McGregor  followed up months of denigrating Khabib Nurmagomedov with a feeble performance in the octagon and a lack of grace in defeat.True, Khabib spoilt his victory by jumping into the crowd to continue the punch-up with McGregor’s corner.  But for the le of me I can’t see how Conor McGregor can claim anything other than unconditional surrender. Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor.

But what we call the Strictly curse is really just an office romance that spirals out of control.People get thrown together at work all the time.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Avery will know all about her big sister but we will always be sad that they never got to meet each other and grow up with one another, forming the bonds and friendships sisters should.Louise said previously: Our babyhad little nails and hair and she was fully formed, fully developed, ready to be born the next day.But now, we know that without I might not be alive had it not been for the accident- and little Avery wouldnt have been born, and I wouldnt be here to have more children in the future.Because of the extra blood I had in me due to my pregnancy, and because Layla cushioned the bump, I wouldnt have lived had it not been for her.I will never forget those words, Im sorry, your baby has died.The mum has joined their legal team at Irwin Mitchell in using Baby Loss Awareness Week to speak out about the support available to other families who have experienced the heartbreak of losing a child.Tracey Storey, Partner and specialist serious injury lawyer at the firm, said: It may have been two years since Layla’s death but the pain and loss that Louise and Laurence continue to experience is still understandably extremely raw.While no amount of money will ever make up for what has happened, we are pleased that Louise has been able to access the support she needs so she, Laurence and their family can try and look to the future the best they can while never forgetting Layla."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000160567226.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the who roger daltry eu bosses brexit jeremy corbyn","story":"The rocknroll legend lashed out at f***ing Jean-Claude Juncker for not following the blocs own rules.And he said the EUs structure is completely flawed and will collapse one day and he was sure it would bring Europe to its knees.Why would we stay in a ship with a hole in it  he told the Sunday Times Magazine today.He went on: What I’m against is Brussels, those nightmare, shadowy people in Brussels.It’s like being governed by Fa.

However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop.“The UK is still committed to making progress at the October European Council.”Representatives from the  other EU nations were told there wasnt yet a deal over the UKs exit from the bloc, and further meetings were needed to get a deal.Mr Raabs last-minute trip was announced after it was reported last night in German press that a deal was set to be sealed today.It came just three days before Theresa May is set to travel to Brussels to give her final pitch to other EU leaders over dinner, in the hopes of securing a deal.One source told the Press Association: It’s very much in the EU’s interests to make it look like there is a deal, as it would look like we are the ones being intransigent.Mr Barnier said last month he needed to see maximum progress by this weeks European Council meeting to make sure a hard border in Northern Ireland would be avoided.And the EUs Donald Tusk branded this week the moment of truth for a Brexit deal.But another summit has already been pencilled in for Novembera deal cant be reached by then.The Northern Irish border is a sticking point for both sides - Mrs May needs to keep her DUP allies happy by making sure theres no extra checks in the Irish sea, but also ensure that her Brexiteers are kept on side too, who want to ensure a clean break with the bloc.However, it was reported yesterday that the DUP boss thinks No Deal is the most likely outcome - after she had hostile talks with Mr Barnier in Brussels last week.The talks are stalled over what should happen with trade and Northern Irelandno Brexit deal is reached.Earlier today Health Secretary Matt Hancock raised the option thata definitive end-date for the Brexit backstop isnt stated, then there could be another get-out clause that Britain could trigger which would mean we would not stay in a customs union with the EU indefinitely.He told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show: The proposal is that is it temporary and time-limited. There are dferent ways to make sure it is time-limited.You can set conditions under which the arrangements come to an end.Previously Brexiteers had been unhappy that the Northern Ireland backstop would have no specied end-date.But another form of break clause could be an alternative option that could keep Leave-backing members of the Cabinet onside.Four ministers could be on the verge of quitting, it was revealed today.The news came as:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441648288.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ben nevis litter tampons toilets","story":"Nearly lbsof litter was removed by volunteers on the UK’s highest peak at the weekend.Thousands of bottles, tissues, clothes, and even a live flare and a sleeping bag were left by some of the , walkers who climb it every year.Mountain guide Rich Pyne said: “We spent an hour there, and ended up with approximately three bin bags each.

It has to come back to le,” he added.In August this year Plymouth Live reported that the development of a “stunning waterfront location entertaining the rich and famous” could finally begin after a marine licence was granted to enable the repair of the ageing jetty.It said this work would clear the way for “experts to gain access and begin transforming the maritime jewel into a world-class spa complete with a high-end hotel, conference facilities and a posh restaurant with commanding views of Plymouth Sound.”Formerly known as St Nicholas Island, after a chapel there, it was used during the Tudor period, having been fortied from “at least the th century”, according to Plymouth City Council.The first fortication was commissioned as part of the country’s maritime line of defence during the war with France, and strengthened in the late s by the installation of guns and garrisons during the war with Spain.It was named after Sir Francis Drake as he set sail from the island in  to famously circumnavigate the globe.Interestingly, two centuries later, Royal Museums Greenwich says, “the first recorded submarine fatality occurred north of Drake’s Island just two years after Captain Cook’s departure [from Plymouth in ], when a carpenter named John Day died while testing a wooden ing chamber.”Although regarded as a heritage site of national importance, with signicant wildle, the council last year gave the green light for a major resort complex.This includes conversion of the existing Grade II buildings and the Scheduled Ancient Monument casemated battery.Drake’s Island’s website explains its plans include reusing the former Governor’s island house, barrack block and ablutions building “as the core for the hotel development”.The barracks will be turned into a -room hotel, while the casemates will become luxury suites.An extensive network of underground tunnel, originally intended for the store of ammunitions and safe passage to the Casemates, will provide access and points of interest for visitors to the island.They will also “serve as cellars and wine stores for the hotel,” the website said.John Kinsey, a director at JLL in Exeter, which is marketing the property, said: Drakes Island is a remarkable piece of British history and a much-loved landmark that the Plymouth community holds close to its heart."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441636939.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cops let thief go 9k tools","story":"Cops were called when neighbours spotted shty men breaking into Slawek Zarebas vehicle overnight on Saturday.Officers arrived and found a man loading nearly  boxes of gear from Mr Zarebas van into another car in Morden, South London.But instead of nicking the thief on the spot, blundering cops had a chat with him and allowed the chancer to drive off with a car full of loot.Tradesman Mr Zareba , woke the next morning to find his whole van emptied.He now has no tools to work with and has slammed cops for letting the theft unfold in front of them. He said: Its absolutely ridiculous what happened.I cant understand what the police are playing at.It was am at the time and I was inside my house, completely unaware of what was happening.Instead of quizzing the thief, checking the car registration details or even knocking my door to double-check, they had a talk with him and watched as they let him waltz off into the night.The police havent even apologised or been back to get fingerprints from my van or look at the CCTV.I havent been able to work since and am losing money.CCTV footage shows the moment police arrive and speak to the thief - who has his own car boot open and a collection of Mr Zarebas tools hanging out the back.Cops bizarrely then get back in their patrol car and drive off behind his car - only for the man tosome  minutes later and continue raiding the van.The gaffe follows reports that cops are not properly investigating nearly a million reported crimes a year.Home Office data shows police abandoned nearly three quarters of car theft probes without identying a suspect.And figures show four fths of house burglaries and nearly half of shoplting cases go unsolved.A Met Police spokesman said: Police were called to reports of a vehicle being broken into in Morden, South London.Officers attended and found a man loading tools from a van into another vehicle.The man gave an explanation for his actions and no arrests were made.Police later established the tools had been stolen.

Cutting air passenger duty is exactly the kind of policy that Brexit Britain should embrace.”Cutting it will make holidays cheaper for families who have been hit by pricier trips because of the weaker Pound.On long haul flights, there is a £ tax on an economy ticket. This is a huge leap from  when it was just £.There is no environmental justication, it is simply used to fill the Treasury’s coffers. Slashing it will also boost businesses hoping to sell products outside of the EU. It will show BrexitBritain is an outward-looking, global nation.We hope you’re listening, Mr Hammond.“It would make saving for hard-earned holidays easier, and it would also make the UK a more attractive place to come to.The Chancellor this March launched a review into APD in Northern Ireland as promised in the confidence and supply deal Theresa May struck with the DUP after last year’s Election disaster.Belfast Airport claims that nearly a million passengers have switched to Dublin in the past year, where the tax was axed in  by Ireland’s then transport minister, current Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Ms Patel and Mr Wilson said a cut would prove Northern Ireland was “open for business” as well as other regional UK airports.The total contribution from APD for the Treasury has ballooned from £ million in  to £. billion – a rise of  per cent.But campaigners claim there is little evidence the money is being used to tackle environmental issues.Frontier Economics last month claimed more than  new airline routes may be added at UK airportsthe Government abolished APD altogether.The think tank claimed an extra  routes would become viable, including eight new destinations from Aberdeen, nine from Belfast and seven from Southampton.James Roberts, political director of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: “Air Passenger Duty manages to fly under most people’s radar, but it has to be one of the most pointless taxes out there.“There’s no real environmental justication – it’s just a straight up levy on both family holidays and air trade links.”The summer holidays are a distant memory and families across the country will be starting to save up for next year’s trip. Yet a big chunk of that cost doesn’t pay for your holiday - it goes straight into the government’s coffers.Buying a ticket for a long-haul flight out of the UK will set you back at least £ in air passenger duty, a tax levied on all adult flyers from UK airports. So for a family of four flying in economy class, you’d have to fork out £, on top of whatever the airline is charging as their fare and airport charges.This is quite the increase from when two rates of either £ or £ was introduced in .Research released last year by A Fair Tax On Flying, which campaigns for a reduction in air passenger duty, shows that this tax makes up  per cent of the average cost of a European short-haul ticket.Looking around, you quickly realise our tax on flying is giving Brits a raw deal. The UK has the highest short and long-haul aviation tax anywhere in Europe. Countries nearby, like Ireland, have abolished their air taxes after seeing the bad effects it had for their economies. Northern Ireland gets hit particularly bad, as holidaymakers head to Dublin to dodge the unnecessary costs.Flying does have consequences, like emissions and noise for people who live right near airports, but the £. billion it raises pays for those many times over.Cutting air passenger duty is exactly the kind of policy that Brexit Britain should embrace. It would make saving for those hard-earned holidays easier, and it would also make the UK a more attractive place to come to. It would be a massive boon for Northern Ireland. Tourists and exporters would see that the country is open for business.Committing to cut air passenger duty in half would be a great message and save flyers millions. That’s why MPs from dferent parties are supporting this campaign from the TaxPayers’ Alliance and A Fair Tax On Flying. The Chancellor should commit to this in next week’s budget and make saving for holidays that bit easier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick has threatened to ban fundraising sites like JustGiving from slapping the five per cent fee on Gt Aid.Peter Lewis, head of the Institute of Fundraising said: “We welcome today’s announcement from JustGiving.“We are pleased to see JustGiving continuing to develop its model and responding proactively to enable donors’ money to go even further, especially at times of major incidents.JustGiving boss Jerry Needel said: “We are very proud to announce that from today, people using JustGiving can crowdfund for free.”He added: “Following feedback from our amazing community of fundraisers, we are also announcing that JustGiving will now be free to use following major incidents including acts of terrorism, catastrophes or natural disasters.“We know people want to help those affected as quickly as possible after these events and we want to do everything we can to support that.”“We are excited about the signicant changes we are making and look forward to continuing our work supporting thousands of charities and millions of iniduals raising funds for the causes that matter to them the most.”Labour MP Neil Coyle, who has lobbied the government to ban sites from charging fees on donations, demanded JustGiving pay back the half a million pounds it took from Grenfell and terror attack funds last year.He said: It is reassuring that no company will again profit when disasters or terrorists strike in our country.But JustGiving must acknowledge the damage theyve done by picking the pockets of all the people affected by Grenfell or last years terror atrocities. Its payback timethey want to rebuild trust completely.John Coventry from the GoFundMe site, which doesnt charge a penny for fundraising, said: The vast majority of campaigns on JustGiving are people raising money for charity, and the companys whopping % fees will still apply to all those running marathons and doing their sponsored walks.When it comes to gt aid - JustGiving will keep pocketing % of taxpayers cash under the cover of a consultation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexiteer Cabinet ministers will on Monday night plot over pizza how to kill it off, which could lead to her being toppled. In a second equally lethal threat,  letters demanding a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister had by Sunday evening been submitted by Tory MPs to the Conservative  Committee. That is just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot, which could see Mrs May being dumped from No. The “pizza club” has reportedly met secretly during times of crisis in Brexit negotiations.  Its latest meeting comes ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders on Wednesday. And at least nine Ministers want Mrs May to drop her current EU plan when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis today urged a full-scale rebellion against her. He wrote in a newspaper: “It is time for the Cabinet to exert their collective authority. This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.” His successor Dominic Raab ed empty-handed from last-minute talks in Brussels on Sunday night - despite speculation Britain had stitched up a secret deal with EU chiefs.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the talks were a bid to seeprogress could be made on outstanding issues and a sign of “how much effort we are putting in”. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted: “Despite intense efforts, some key issues are still open, including the backstop for IE NI to avoid a hard border. I will debrief the EU.” A joint statement by the Brexit Department and  Downing Street did not even commit to the issue being resolved on Wednesday - it only said there would be progress. The statement said: In the last few days UK and EU negotiators have made real progress in a number of key areas.However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop.“The UK is still committed to making progress at the October European Council.” The backstop – a mechanism to avoid a hard border – poses a threat to Mrs May’s leadership. The EU’s version would keep just Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels’ rules. Mrs May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole of the UK. But Tory Brexiteers fear it could become an open-ended position which would prevent free trade deals around the world. Mr Hunt insisted only Mrs May could get the right deal for Britain, adding: “She is battling for Britain”. But Tory MP Nadine Dorries suggesting installing Mr Davis as interim leader, adding: “Getting May out and him becoming an interim leader may be the only way to deliver Brexit and FTA.” Allies of Mr Davis said he has been contacted by several Tory MPs urging him to run for the leadership. He is understood to be prepared to runthere is a contest.  Critics of Mrs May believe the no confidence vote threshold could be passed by Wednesdayshe refuses to change her position. At least four Cabinet Minister are rumoured to be seriously considering quitting over her Brexit plan. Speculation has centred on Andrea Leadsom , Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey . But Scottish Secretary David Mundell, and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, could also quit. In a letter to the PM, the pair said the integrity of the UK “remains the single most important issue for us”. They indicated they will not tolerate a situation in which Northern Ireland is treated dferently from the rest of Britain over the EU customs issues. A source close to Ms Davidson said the issue was a “red line” for her, while a source close to Mr Mundell said resigning was a “logical outcome” for those who do not agree with Government policy. Mrs May, pictured today at her local church with husband Philip, depends on the votes of the Democratic Unionist Party , who prop up her minority administration. According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated her party was “ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one”. But Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the Labour party wanted a “meaningful vote”, adding: “If she comes back with something that’s just a fudge she’s cooked up with Brussels... we’re not voting for something that’s essentially a bridge to nowhere.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire tories eyes wrong","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Tories all have eyes on theprize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membershipMirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UKShare prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" prize - best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership\" data-social-headline\"Kevin Maguire - The Tories all have their eyes on theprize\" data-url\"https:www.mirror news politics kevin-maguire-tories-eyes-wrong-\" data-leadtext\"Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire says the national interest is largely being forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals agonising over what’s best for them and not the UK\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Theresa-May-Brexits.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  OCT NewsopinionNobody wants to admit the truth, writes Kevin Maguire\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPersonal ambition driving both a Theresa May desperate to survive and treacherous Cabinet Ministers equally desperate to replace her is an unprecedented British disaster. The national interest is largely forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals, bloodlust opponents agonising over what’s best for them rather than the country. When the post of Prime Minister’s the goal of wavering Ministers calculating whether it’s better to back or sack May, the jobs of millions who voted to Leave and Remain are collateral damage for Tories obsessed with their own futures. I’ve never witnessed a Government disintegrate with the poisonous animosity of May’s collapsing regime. The reigns of Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown and particularly Cameron finished in acrimony – an iron law of politics the tenure of all PMs end in failure. Yet this Conservative uncivil war’s unmatched in bile, squabbling Tories too busy scoring points against each other to champion Britain in negotiations with  united European neighbours.  At such a crucial juncture for the country, revolting Conservative MPs coming close to submitting the  letters triggering a self-indulgent leadership contest is proof Brexit is all about them, not you. Plastic patriots, right-wing nationalists blindly waving flags to hide their cluelessness, call the shots in a misgoverning party’s increasing Ukipisation that is symbolised by the membership of a purple Colonel Blimp former MEP, offensive reactionary Godfrey Bloom. So Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey fret over staying or going, boosting or ruining their chances of the Premiership. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid fuss over supporting or opposing May’s Brexit plan for the same reasons.  And David Davis and Boris Johnson compete to be the most aggressive quitter. Whatever Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, another with his eye on the personal prize, agrees with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is irrelevantMay loses the Tory Party, never mind Parliament.

The country is ready to hit back against any punitive action “with a bigger one”, a source quoted by state news agency SPA warned. Washington Post journalist Mr Khashoggi vanished on October  after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US President Donald Trump has threatened to “punish” Saudi Arabiait were found responsible for killing him. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned Saudi Arabia would suffer “serious consequences”evidence showed the country murdered Mr Khashoggi. But the source quoted by SPA said: “The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats or attempts to undermine it whether through threats to impose economic sanctions or the use of political pressure. “The kingdom also affirms that it will respond to any action with a bigger one. The Saudi economy has vital and influential roles for the global economy.”  The war of words came as a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany called for a credible investigation to ensure those responsible for Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance were held to account. “We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response,” said Jeremy Hunt, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas. Britain and the US are considering boycotting a major international conference in Saudi Arabia this month. Turkey believes Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate by Saudi agents. Saudi Arabia says this is “lies”. Reports say Mr Khashoggi may have recorded his own murder on his Apple Watch. They claim the device was logging his interrogation by a -strong hit squad. A copy of the audio then synced with his iPhone, which he had handed to his fianceacutee before entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. It is claimed the recording automatically uploaded to his iCloud account.  Fianceacutee Hatice Cengiz would have had to have been in bluetooth range outside the embassy to receive the audio on the phone. It was also alleged Saudi officials tried to delete the watch recording - first by incorrectly guessing Mr Khashoggi’s PIN, then later using the journalist’s finger. Apple Watches do not have a fingerprint ID unlock , unlike iPhones. The reports remain unconfirmed.. Washington Post journalist Khashoggi, a staunch critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been missing since visiting the consulate on October . Turkish officials believe he was executed by an assassination squad. They also alleged that they have video of the murder, but have yet to explain how they have it. Saudi Interior Minister Prince Abdu-laziz bin Saud said: “What has been circulating about orders to kill are lies and baseless allegations against the government of the kingdom.” Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu urged Saudi Arabia to start co-operating with the investigation and to let Turkish officials into the consulate.  UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has demanded “the truth” over Mr Khashoggi. He said he feared such disappearances would become a “new normal”. Meanwhile, Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry has vowed that Britain would stop selling weapons to Saudi ArabiaLabour were elected into government. She also slammed the UK government response to Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, saying the Tories had failed to hold the Saudis to account in the face of mounting evidence.  Ms Thornberry said the alleged murder was “yet more evidence of how the Saudi prince in particular appears to be out of control” and “this country has had enough”. A critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the US and writing opinion pieces for the Washington Post before he vanished. He visited the consulate on October  to obtain a document confirming he had orced his ex-we, in order to allow him to remarry. Turkish officials have said he was killed on the premises and his body removed. Saudi officials have denied the allegations as baseless.

Joanne Sansom, , wrote to Matt Hancock on Thursday complaining she had lost pound a week while caring for her autistic nine-year-old son Joshua.But today the Health Secretary - who has even set up an app to talk to constituents - claimed: Ive seen Universal Credit in operation in my own constituency, where I’ve had no letters on it at all.Joanne said she was left in anger and disbelief by Mr Hancocks performance on the BBCs Andrew Marr Show - which she branded a bare-faced lie. She told the Mirror: Ive never personally experienced a politician lying. You obviously hear that they do and you know they spin things to suit their agenda.Are you a West Suffolk constituent who has written to Matt Hancock about Universal Credit  If so contact ususing the form at the bottom of this article. I just couldnt believe it. I can pretty much guarantee Im not the only person [who wrote to him] - I would put every single penny in my bank account on that. Universal Credit, which combines six legacy benefits into one monthly payment, first rolled out to Mr Hancocks rural West Suffolk seat in October . Joanne, from Stanton, said she moved onto UC around two months ago when her seasonal warehouse job ended - triggering a change in circumstances. She told the Mirror she receives around pound a month in UC, plus carers allowance and a Disability Living Allowance award for her son.  Joanne claimed she first wrote to Mr Hancock in September, but had since deleted the e-mail account she used so could provide no proof. Mr Hancocks office found no record of that correspondence today. However, the Mirror has confirmed she sent a second e-mail, dated October , in which she told the MP: The amount UC pays me is pound a week less than what I was receiving on tax credits and income support. I was completely unaware that this was going to happen and not told by anyone in the process that I would actually be paid less than I was before. I am now in a financial crisis whilst trying to care and provide for a disabled child. I am of working age, but cannot have a full-time job because of my caring responsibilities.A food bank in the next-door seat to Mr Hancocks warned in July its stocks were at critical levels amid record demand due to benefit changes.Days later a letter to the Bury Free Press urged locals to write to Mr Hancock to stop UC leaving people without free NHS prescriptions.Mr Hancock has previously been accused of failing to reply to constituents.Jacqui McKay wrote to the Bury Free Press in July: I had cause to write to him last year but did not receive a reply or even an acknowledgement. I also know of a charity that contacted him and, like me, had no response. She did not say what the letters were about. Mr Hancock was also accused of failing to respond to a local parish council on a separate issue in . He defended the delay at the time saying I receive hundreds of letters and e-mails a week.A source close to the minister admitted the e-mail had been received but staff had not had time to update Mr Hancock on it. The source said it took up to a fortnight to respond to correspondence. A spokesman for Mr Hancock’s office said: We have recently received an email from a constituent that Matt wasnt aware of and he will respond in the usual way.  UC has already rolled out to .million people, % of whom have a job, and .million existing claimants will move onto it from July. Labour and Tory backbenchers have urged the rollout to be stopped, while its Tory architect Iain Duncan Smith has demanded poundbillion is put back into the system. This week Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey admitted some claimants will be worse off. Mr Hancock insisted that for people who are migrated onto the new benefit, there is a poundbn package to ensure people aren’t worse off. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition.

This is fundamentally wrong.” Even Iain Duncan Smith – the architect of the system – called on the PM to back poundbillion of extra funding for welfare in this month’s Budget. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show universal credit was working as he had received “no letters on it at all” – only to immediately be blasted by constituents who claimed their letters had simply been ignored.  By NICOLA STURGEON, First Minister of Scotland Universal Credit is causing misery. Increases in rent arrears and the use of foodbanks in areas where Universal Credit is already implemented paint a clear picture of the damaging impact it is having on our people and communities. Our Welfare Reform Report showed that by the end of this decade Scottish people will have lost pound.billion through UK Government cuts to welfare spending. That’s money out of the pockets of the lowest income families in our country and, importantly, out of local communities. That will have an impact on people on low pay, or low hours and those in fluctuating or seasonal work. People already struggling will have their situation made worse by a policy not fit for purpose. The benefits freeze is the largest of the cuts and the UK Government should show its commitment to ending austerity by immediately lting this freeze and uprating benefits in line with inflation. But it’s not the only part of Universal Credit that is causing issues. Our report also estimates that by   the Two Child Limit will cost Scottish families poundmillion in reduced payments, so the policy that led to the abhorrent “rape clause” will cause further damage. I can tell the UK Government just a few changes they could make right now to minimise the impact on people:Lt the benefits freeze Stop sanctions End the two child limit Reinstate work allowances so work actually pays And no one should have to wait five weeks to get money to feed their children or heat their homes.Quite simply, the rollout of Universal Credit needs to be halted and that is why I support this campaign by the Daily Mirror.

The pair said they were delighted by portrait photographer Alex Bramalls images which display their joy at tying the knot. Heres some of the things you may have missed on first glance:Prince Philip is seated next to the Duchess of YorkSarah Ferguson is not the most popular person in the Royal Family and rumour has it that Prince Philip particularly dislikes his former daughter-in-law. Despite remaining firm friends, the wedding is also believed to be the first time Andrew and Fergie have been photographed together since their orce was finalised in . Placing Fergie so close to the royals may be a conscious effort to ease the long-standing animosity between the feuding family members. But while this is clearly a happy occassion for both Philip and the Duchess of York, the Duke of Edinburghs lean to the right may be telling. Queen does something we dont often see Weddings are happy occasions but its not often that the ever-professional Queen is pictured with a beaming smile. The proud grandparent looked particularly chuffed in the officially released photo. Dressed in blue, she is sat to the left of the newlyweds and looks very happy in what must have been an incredibly proud moment for her.  One of the photos clearly displays the affection that the royal newlyweds have for each other as they made their way to a private evening dinner on Friday night. Eugenie, who opted for a gorgeous blush-coloured silk Zac Posen design, is staring affectionately at her new husband as they walk hand-in-hand. The pair would have be forgiven for showing some wedding day nerves ahead of the speeches - but not for this contented couple. Princess Eugenie wore hair slide belonging to Queen  Princess Eugenie also wore a hair slide belonging to Her Majesty The Queen. Queen Victoria’s Wheat-Ear Brooches were originally commissioned by William IV in  for Queen Adelaide, according to the royal familys website. They were passed down to Queen Victoria in , and eventually to The Queen in . Her Majesty has worn them as both hair slides and brooches. A royal jewellery blogger notes that six exist, but the Queen wears them infrequently. In , on a visit to the US, she was seen wearing one in her hair, while in  she had one pinned to her chest. Eugenie also wore diamond and emerald drop earrings which were a wedding gt from the groom.Robbie Williams daughter appeared to be on her best behaviourRobbie Williams and Ayda Fields daughter revealed her cheeky side by asking Sarah Fergusonshe was the Queen while they waited outside St Georges Chapel in Westminster.No, Fergie replied, before Teddy pressed, Youre a princess  But an image of the bridal party shows the six-year-old standing right next to Mr Brooksbank, who rests his hand on her shoulder as she beams happily.Its extremely hard to get kids to smile for wedding photos - but Prince George and Charlotte are naturals Prince George and Princess Charlotte appeared delighted as they posed with their fellow young guests. Even at their tender age, the pair have had lots of practice smiling for cameras. In the main family picture, however, the page boys and bridesmaids appeared to be under a bit of strain. Lets hope they were able to find their energy for the rest of the festivities. Mia Tindall wasnt impressed with getting her picture taken  Zara and Mike Tindalls little girl and great-granddaughter of the Queen did not look at all amused in the pictures. Little Mia failed to raise even a hint of a smile as she sits on a footstool in front of Prince George. The photographer also appeared to struggle to get the four-year-old to look into the camera.

Chris Taylor, prosecuting, said: “After arresting him and askinghe had any other material he responded ‘come on then, I’ll show you, so you don’t make a mess’.” Gilbert, a retired plumber, led them to a front bedroom and from the bottom drawer of a chest and a cavity within a wardrobe he produced a number of folders which contained indecent photographs of children and a laptop. He told them: I know it’s getting out of control. When you live on your own you need someone to give you a kick up the arse. I’ve been telling myself for years, I’ve got kids and grandkids, just get rid, but I never did. If my son and daughter ever find out I don’t know what I’ll do.” A full analysis of his computer, an SD card and the folders revealed he had , indecent images of children, including girls ranging in age from six to  and boys aged  to  years.

Seven sickening images of bestiality were also found,” said Mr Taylor. Gilbert, of Lowe Drive, pleaded guilty to five offences involving downloading and possessing the indecent images. Defence barrister Gareth Roberts said Gilbert was relieved when the police arrived at his home “as it started the process of him bringing to an end what he knew was a bad thing and started his rehabilitation”. He has no previous convictions and is regarded by the probation service as a low risk of re-offending. Mr Roberts said his client had an unhappy le and although he was married for  years, his we suffered mental health problems when their children were young and was sectioned. He added: “Since his we’s death and possibly before he became increasingly isolated living alone.”  Mr Roberts said Gilbert had not had a good relationship with his children and is now estranged from them since the offences came to light. He said: “He had become increasingly obsessed with pursuing pornographic images of children, it became it was what he did most days and he knew that he was doing wrong and accepted that behind every image there was an abused child.” Mr Roberts said Gilbert no longer had any equipment enabling him to get onto the internet and wants to avoid any potential for re-offending. Sentencing him to a three-year community order, Judge Stephen Everett said Gilbert had had more than , indecent images of children.He said: “We will never know what happened to those children. You and people like you encourage this behaviour. They may have been disposed of by these terrible people to stop them talking.“Potentially the last moments of le was that sexual abuse and then their lives ended. You will never know.” The judge told him he was making a community order as there was a genuine prospect of his rehabilitation and he will be under supervision for three years.He imposed a five year Sexual Harm Prevention Order and ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the same period of time.

An ambulance with paramedics Amy and Lloyd arrived very soon after. Leanne described the team as beyond amazing. But she was worried something would go horribly wrong.  We were so lucky there were no complications as it was just us, she said. I feel great now. I was induced with my first. I had a very strong and long labour, and this was the exact opposite. Im on an adrenaline high at the moment. The midwives at Gloucester were amazing and gave us all a quick check-over and a cup of tea. I had some stitches, and then they said we were free to go home, so was home by am. I cant thank the paramedics enough. I bloody love the NHS and emergency services.

The Foreign Office has put out an urgent warning over Putin’s spooks’ tactics. A memo states: “Russian services regard them as high-priority targets.” Putin’s ruthless shycampaign to recruit traitors from Britain comes as he tries to appear strong at home, experts say. The Russian President is under growing pressure amid a flagging economy and recent blunders by his GRU intelligence agency – including the botched novichok attack in Salisbury. A former British intelligence officer told the Mirror: “The perceived threat Putin wants to portray to Russians is that the West is surrounding them and that his motherland is a victim.  “Whilst all the time he can smirk at the suggestion the GRU has been trying to disrupt Western democracies, the blunders his men have made are becoming embarrassing. His intelligence agencies are desperate to claw back credibility by making inroads into shyBritain’s intelligence operations by recruiting insiders.” Such is the escalating campaign by Moscow’s spooks that Foreign Office officials have sent out an urgent warning to ex-MI staff and diplomats. The memo, leaked to the Mirror, states loved ones could be threatened.  It says: “Russian services regard both current and former retired members of the service as high-priority targets. Russian services have a tradition of using pressure in their operations. This may be used against both former members of staff and close relations.” Russian spies use a iety of techniques to coerce people into becoming agents or disclosing secrets, ranging from blatant threats of violence to subtle persuasion. Behind the scenes for years, Moscow’s spooks have become increasingly aggressive towards Western diplomats, sometimes resorting to violence. The Mirror understands several US staff have been beaten up by Russian thugs on the intelligence agency payroll. Some have also had their homes burgled.  One security source said: “This is an intimidation tactic, it breeds insecurity, builds up tension and is considered a breach in the professional standards of the intelligence community.” The Foreign Office declined to comment on the memo. Tensions between Russia and Britain escalated in March with the novichok nerve agent attack by GRU operatives Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin on former Kremlin intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia. Twelve GRU men have also been indicted with hacking the US election. There are few known examples of Britons becoming Russian spies. However, one is still alive. George Blake, , turned on being captured during the Korean War. In  he was jailed for being a KGB double agent. He escaped in  and fled to the Soviet Union. In  he was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin.Spies involved in novichok-style attacks will face EU sanctions including asset-freezing and travel bans, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will say today.Ex-spooks are vulnerable and there are plenty of targetsANALYSIS By Chris HughesBritish intelligence agencies have doubled in size in the past  years and many officers serve for under  years. This means there is a huge pool of Brits with sensitive information. Ex-spies will know operational details of MI missions against Russia, names of spies and double agents and new spying techniques. Diplomats may have data on ex-colleagues, Government plans and commercially sensitive projects. All of this can be used to give Russia the upper hand – making former staff vulnerable. Particularly at risk are new businesses set up by former Government workers, needing cash to get started. The really dficult area is security, where many ex-spooks go to earn decent money. Russians throwing cash at these companies to perform due diligence checks on employees or other small projects can mask their real intentions. Gradually, people can be sucked in until they are compromised and find it hard to turn down lucrative contracts or refuse to work with someone they suddenly suspect is on the payroll of the Kremlin. It is in this area that Russia has been particularly aggressive – trying to employ British intelligence firms to find out information about iniduals. There are many ways Russia can subtly recruit someone. Sometimes they can do it and the target does not realise until it is too late. Other times a more direct approach is used – or even blackmail.

She says: “At the beginning, he was still pushing away from me, it was hard. But soon he understood that I was there to care for him. I was there to feed him, bathe him, give him all he needs. “Then he slowly understood I was there to care, not to harm him. “He started to open up very quickly and would then latch on to me. No one  could carry him!” When I arrive, Jay, who is eating a snack at the kitchen table, flashes a cheeky smile and gives a little wave – a sign of how far he has come. In the last two years, he has blossomed into a happy, confident little boy, but he desperately needs a permanent family to adopt him. Jay is one of thousands of children across the UK waiting to find their forever home and the authorities are appealing for prospective families to come forward in the hope they will find someone to adopt him. As Bukky recalls his first month at her home in London, Jay is playing happily with his toy police car at our feet. It is hard to imagine him as a timid little boy as he happily shows off his favourite toys. He takes me up into his bedroom, where his toy cars are neatly in a row. His favourite is his police car, which has blue flashing lights and a siren. Ask Jay what he wants to be when he grows up and elements of that shy personality are still apparent, but it is adorable. He runs up to Bukky, whispers in her ear, “a policeman” and runs back to his toy car. “He also says he wants to be a fireman and a doctor”, Bukky laughs. Jay is in reception class at school and is settling in well, especially with reading and writing.  Bukky says: “His teachers adore him and he gets on well with the other children. He’s very sociable, quiet at times, very caring. Above all, Jay loves to read. We read every day. “Before school, I’d take him to the library every week.” But Jay also enjoys making the most of the outdoors as well as being in the classroom. Bukky adds: “Jay just loves to dance, he loves to run, and I take him to the park as much as I can.” And one of the other things Jay prides himself on is his appearance. Laughing, Bukky says: “He loves getting his hair done. He used to have long hair. “We cut it about three months ago and he loves it. It was the funniest thing though, the first time we had his hair cut, we went to a specic barber. But when we took him the second time, my husband took him to his own barber’s. “But Jay said, ‘No! I already have my own barber!’ We all laughed a lot. He’s very sure of himself when it comes to his presentation and he knows what he wants.”  One of the most noticeable things about Jay – evident from meeting him just once – is his kind and loving nature, the way he keeps running up to his foster mum and gently giving her a cuddle, how polite he is when meeting new people. Bukky says: “When we got rid of his buggy because he was too big for it, he’d say, ‘Can we give it to another mummy with a baby ’ That’s the kind of thoughtful boy he is and that’s all him. He is naturally caring. “He just has the loveliest nature.” Even though Jay has matured into a positive little boy, he still has moments where he will keep to himself. Bukky says: “Because of everything he’s gone through, Jay needs a lot of love, someone that has time for him that really, really loves him. “He can be a child who sometimes keeps to himself, he will go back into his cocoon sometimes. He needs someone who will draw him out. “Jay needs that attention and love, someone who will speak to him when he wants to talk. He’s a deep thinker and very, very thoughtful.” Bukky says Jay has brought her so much joy and her family will miss him. She says: “From the day he stepped in, it has been an absolute joy. I will always think of him as a blessing. All you have to do is look at that smile.” * If you are interested in adopting Jay, call    or visit www.firstadoption.org.uk There are THREE TIMES more children than adopters Children who are desperate for “forever families” face a crisis, with almost three times as many of them as there are adopters. There are , children in England with an adoption order and just  families approved to adopt, research by national adoption information service FirstAdoption found. Some % of the children are under five, % are boys, % are black and minority ethnic and % are in sibling groups, Adoption Register for England data reveals. The Mirror has partnered with FirstAdoption for National Adoption Week to help find them new homes. FirstAdoption’s Gemma Gordon-Johnson said: “These figures show an urgent need to find the right families for vulnerable children. “Many experience neglect or abuse, struggle to trust adults, have complex health needs or are slow to meet developmental milestones. “There are also children born into violent homes who witness things no child should see. “Adoption is a lelong commitment and it takes a special kind of person. “But being placed into a safe and loving family can dramatically transform these children’s lives. “If you think you have what it takes visit HERE.” "},{"url":null,"title":"storm callum mcdonalds worker 21","story":"NewsStorm Callum: McDonalds worker, , was killed by landslide as he watched rescue operationCorey Sharpling was on his way to work when he was struck by rocks in the storm in Carmarthen, west WalesShareCommentsByTom BedfordBradley Jolly:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsCoreys family said he had a great wit and sense of humour \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA tragic boyfriend killed in a landslide during Storm Callum was his heartbroken partners love of her le.

Inspector Chris Neve, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: Officers attended the A near Cwmduad on Saturday, October , following reports a tree had fallen on to the road. While officers were dealing with the obstruction a large scale landslide occurred, which tragically resulted in Corey losing his le at the scene.

One in four have also been subjected to ‘do you worry about them going back to their real family one day ’ This was voted the most hurtful to adoptive parents, who are legally the ‘real family’ of their child. More than one third have also had people say, ‘you’re so cute, how could anyone have given you up ’ or ‘I cant believe they abandoned you ...’ to an adopted child. Shockingly,  per cent of families have even been asked ‘what type of abuse did the child go through ’ Others were grilled by people asking ‘wheres his or her real parents ’ while  per cent were told ‘youre a saint for adopting, I couldnt’.

Thirty-five per cent have had people say ‘oh just watch, now youll get pregnant’ – suggesting a biological child is more important.Siobhan Freegard, founder of ChannelMum , said: “How you become a parent doesn’t matter – it’s the job that you do when you are a parent which is crucial.“Parents by adoption simply want the same treatment as everyone . “Although the questions are well-meaning, it’s unlikely any other parents would face that level of personal intrusion, so there’s simply no need to ask them to parents by adoption.” The poll also revealed strangers are most likely to make inappropriate comments, with  per cent of adoptive families targeted by people they don’t know.  One third of adoptive families have had inappropriate questions from workmates, and  per cent have fielded them from medical staff, such as health visitors and GPs. However, another one in three of the , mums and dads polled have said something which they didn’t realise would hurt an adoptive parent. The study also found  per cent of UK families have considered adoption with the top reason being ‘to give a child a good home.’ However, just five per cent went ahead with the adoption process. One in seven were worried about being judged by social workers and adoption agencies, while  per cent said their partner was not fully supportive. To boost falling UK adoption rate, three quarters of parents think the Government must do more to publicise the positives of adoption, so it is viewed as equal to parenting a biological child or having IVF. Three in five also want adoption to be offered alongside IVF while almost half would like to see more positive adoption storylines in soaps and the media.

Sally Nowell, , tripped on her dog Kyra and tumbled into the pit. The stable jockey told Somerset Live she suffered horrendous injuries and was unconscious for some time.But brave Sally dragged herself along on her elbows to clamber out of the quarry  hours later. Speaking of her ordeal for the first time today, Sally said: Ive been up there with my husband lots of times. But this time I decided to take a path I hadnt ever been down before.  I wanted to see so I wandered off the path and peered over the edge – it was a big drop with a lot of rocks and undergrowth. I got a bit scared and I turned back around to make sure the dog hadnt got too close the edge. But I was a bit disoriented, I took a step back and tripped over a dog. Despite crashing into rocks at the bottom of the clf and suffering a shattered pelvis, Sally somehow crawled through the chambers near Midsomer Norton, Somerset. She added: I remember falling through the air. Everything slows down. I remember thinking to myself this is going to hurt. I remember it was getting dark when I woke up.  I didnt know where I was – I was severely concussed. It took me a while to figure out but it started coming back to me. The pain wasnt too bad at first. It must have been the adrenaline. I knew my arm was broken because it was at a funny angle. I tried to walk but the pain in my pelvis wouldnt let me use my legs. Sally said she heard a rescue helicopter hovering above the quarry as she scurried to find safety.  But her husband Paul, , wasnt due home from his job as a self-employed mechanical engineer until much later. I was crawling along on my elbows. It was further than I thought, I kept having to rest. I couldnt very get far with the pain and the concussion. I managed to get about half way but I had to stop.  At one point it [the police helicopter] flew straight over with its searchlight but it didnt see me. Thats when I started to panic. When they flew away again, I think I started to give up hope. Sally spent the rest of the night in August this year drting in and out of consciousness.  She continued: As the morning came the I started to panic, I thought maybe nobody would find me.But then one of the dogs barked – I thought they might have heard someone so I called out – and one of the search and rescuers called back Weve got you. Were coming.Sally was overcome with relief and exhaustion when her rescuers arrived.  The jockey was given painkillers and airlted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where she was found to have three broken vertebrae, a broken wrist, three or four broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a shattered pelvis and a lacerated spleen. Her heat stopped on the operating table while surgeons were trying to save her. They had to resuscitate me and they had to put a chest drain in. They said I was very lucky I didnt bleed to death from the injury to my spleen, said Sally.  She was out of intensive care in a week and ing home in another week. However she still is receiving hospital treatment for her injuries. Pre-existing conditions, such as anorexia, have been worsened as a result of the ordeal. I really wanted to say thank you to the search and rescue team and the air ambulance and everyone at the hospital.

They know that after the moment frozen in time in the photograph the British troops went back to an uncertain fate on the frontline. Saint-Vaast church meanwhile was pummelled by further intense shelling in attacks that ultimately failed to shatter Allied resistance. Accompanied by the current priest, Abbe Luc Lesage, the faithful were pleased to recreate such a symbolic event for one of McLellan’s successors - Daily Mirror photographer Phil Coburn - as they finished mass. Sylvie Duclercq, , said: “It’s incredible that these statues survived after what happened at the time, just extraordinary. The church itself was completely ruined. The roof was blown off completely, making the building unusable. “For us it is amazing that this picture exists which shows how the statues were saved. Thanks to the photographer from the Daily Mirror the people of Armentieres will always have this memory of what took place in .” Today Saint-Vaast is a magnicent edice that stands proud in the heart of Armentieres, which was right on the frontline when the photograph was taken in February . By the time German forces took it during their Spring Offensive, aimed at pushing British isions back and cutting off supply lines to the English Channel, it was mostly rubble. There are reminders of the First World War wherever you go, on giant posters throughout the town, and in a copy of McLellan’s photograph pinned to the church noticeboard.  In the last  months of the First World War no other photographer depicted the most signicant events so thoroughly as David McLellan. After a transfer from the Royal Flying Corps, he was appointed as an official war photographer in December  along with another Daily Mirror snapper, Tom Aitken. One of only five official photographers working on the Western Front, his work was noted for the way it captured the immense scale of operations as Allied forces engaged in vital rearguard actions and offensives that eventually led to the Armistice of November . What makes the images remarkable is that all of them had to be submitted to Army generals for censorship before publication as part of his photographer’s permit. When the Allies broke through the German defensive lines in the autumn of  in what became the final big push, McLellan made sure he was there. He travelled with the troops as they breached the Canal de Saint-Quentin, one of the most heavily fortied stretches of the Hindenberg Line. The assault had been preceded by the greatest British artillery bombardment of the war, in which more than one million shells were fired in a short period of time.  Such was the ferocity of the onslaught that the enemy soldiers were pinned in their dugouts. In early October  the troops of the North Staffordshire Regiment seized the strategically vital Riqueval Bridge before the Germans had a chance to fire their explosive charges. Thousands of prisoners were taken by British, American and Australian soldiers. They also managed to gain control of a key tunnel on the canal, a short walk from Riqueval, which had been turned into a fortress complete with kitchens and field hospitals. The triumph at Saint-Quentin became one of the most signicant victories of the war, and a moment to be captured on camera. Several thousand British soldiers sat on what had, until the day before, been the German-controlled eastern bank opposite as Brigadier General JV Campbell addressed them from the bridge. They were like tiny ants on the high earth bank, which had been raised by the Germans for deep trenches dug behind. Such a gathering of so many infantrymen in the same place at the same time was a rare spectacle.  Many of the them were smiling and wore le jackets having swam or got across the canal in the flotation devices. Once again McLellan recognised such a striking image. The photograph resonated with the generals as brilliant propaganda to show the public back home. It proved that after four appalling years, progress was slowly being made. Having broken through at Riqueval, the Allied forces were able to advance, eventually bringing about the Armistice ceasefire. Thousands more men came over the bridge, including poet Wilfred Owen with the Manchester Regiment. Conditions at Riqueval when I visited last week could not have been more dferent. There was birdsong instead of gunfire, shards of sunlight hitting the still water and where there were once soldiers there are now trees. But the evidence of what once happened here was all around. On the bridge I met three local young men with metal detectors and a bag containing their haul from the morning – shrapnel, shell casings and even the remnants of a German soldier’s identity tag. Raphael Plancot, , said: “The ground here is full of First World War ordnance. We come here all the time and find things. Millions of bombs landed here. When the sun is shining you can see the shells glinting on the bed of the canal.” After Riqueval McLellan stayed with the Allied armies as they surged forwards. His work now forms an important part of the archives kept for future generations, including those at the Imperial War Museum and the National Library of Scotland. Not only did he show British soldiers in battle, he also showed what was going on behind the lines – the men, women and children whose lives were forever changed. He portrayed the daily lives of soldiers in the trenches, the first use of tanks across no man’s land, gas attacks and even the brief of interludes of peace when the guns fell silent. McLellan’s legacy is an unparalleled set of photographs, now digitised, which are a permanent reminder of the horrors of the bloodiest conflict in history.

There should be some kind of shuttle bus service to take people directly to the car park from the hospital entrance.“You have to stop in the dark and look for money to get a parking ticket – that is a safety concern.”Steven McDonald, , a construction worker from Perth, said: “If it’s dark it should be lit up, especiallyyou’re paying for it. People could trip and fall.”Louise Davidson, , from Menzieshill, said: “If there’s no light, anyone could be creeping around.”Bob McGlashan, senior officer for the Royal College of Nursing, stressed that safety is paramount and called for anyone experiencing any issues to come forward.Indigo, which operates the car park, declined to comment on the issue.The concerns raised come as support continues to flood in for the Tele’s petition calling for Indigo to freeze parking fees.Indigo is locked in a -year contract with NHS Tayside to run all the Ninewells Hospital car parks.Fees have been rising constantly in recent years, meaning people who attend the hospital through necessity are having to fork out more and more.The firm plans to raise the costs again, so day tickets will go up to

McLean being put in charge of Saturday’s controversial clash with Kilmarnock despite having strong family connections with the Ayrshire club.McLean blundered by awarding the second-half penalty that

Fleming, to question the sense behind having McLean taking games involving Kilmarnock.“Several of our members have contacted me to express their concerns over this and we think it’s only right to pass them on to the authorities,” said DSA chairman Kenny Ross.“And I do think there is reason to question the validity of this appointment when the referee so clearly has family connections to Kilmarnock.“If nothing  it puts him in a dficult position when you get a decision like Saturday’s.“I know that Steven McLean’s brother Brian played for Dundee United, Ross County and a few other clubs and he was not allowed to take charge of games involving teams he was at.“You think the same common sense approach could have been applied to his dad’s old team.”The fans also pointed out should the Killie player who ed to win the kick, Jordan Jones, be handed a two-game ban, that in itself could damage Dundee.The games he would miss would be against St Mirren and Hamilton, the two sides

eight-year engagement, it took just five weeks for Dundee bus drivers Kevin Lowden and Dawn Brownlie to plan their big day.Kevin, , and Dawn, , met in  through their work with bus company

he eventually decided to chat to me I thought to myself, ‘oh, I quite like him’.”Kevin, originally from St Mary’s, added: “I had noticed Dawn before and was definitely interested in her. That is probably why I never talked as I was nervous.”When a colleague found out about the mutual interest, she channelled her inner Cilla Black and set them up.After their first date, Kevin and Dawn were inseparable and within six months they were engaged and living together.Kevin said: “We had been shopping one day and Dawn pointed out an engagement ring that she loved as it was so unique.“I waited until she went into another shop and went back to the jewellers and bought it.“That was in August and it was meant to be her Christmas present but I couldn’t keep it a secret so I got down on one knee in the house.“Dawn said yes straight away, despite being a bit shocked.”After the y engagement, a barbecue and a few drinks this summer led to the frequently asked question from the couple’s pals: “When are you two going to get married ”.With a holiday booked for September, the bride-to-be joked: “Who knows, maybe we will just do it while we are off.”Kevin decided to move things on and booked the registrar’s office for September  – just five weeks later.Dawn said: “Once the date was confirmed, it was mayhem.“We were offered a vintage bus as our transport by Tay Bus Vintage Vehicle Society and I was really up for it but Kevin point-blank refused. We then realised that our wedding day coincided with the opening of the VA so the only way we were getting to our wedding was on the bus driven by our good friend Stevie Reid. He was amazing all day and acted like our taxi driver.“I am so glad now that we had the bus as it was such a laugh.“We got some funny looks driving down the dual carriageway in it.“Everyone on the streets was waving and my bridesmaid Jenner Turner started a confetti fight.“I had my bus driver head on and told her she couldn’t do it but when she asked Stevie he just laughed and it turned into confetti chaos. It was amazing.”Kevin added: “Although I didn’t want the bus to begin with, I was so happy with it on the day. It was very cool and a great laugh.”Kevin was joined by pal Paul Turner as best man, admitting he has too many male family members to have had to choose from them.The couple said “I do” in the registrar’s office in the city centre before having a meal with close family and friends and hitting the Fairmuir clubbie at night for an unofficial reception.Dawn said: “One of Kevin’s sons lives in Australia and couldn’t make it to the wedding so we decided we would wait until he is home next year before having a reception.“Instead we went to the Fairmuir clubbie, where we go every week, and they made it so special. Even the band, Scotland Rocks, pulled us up on to the dancefloor and gave us a first dance. I can’t thank the club enough for making it an even more special day.”The happy couple would also like to thank good friend and former colleague Gordon Baird for his photography skills, David Murdoch who created the wedding cake and Flowers by Dawn who made the bouquets.Dawn added: “I may have only had five weeks to organise the day but I wouldn’t change a thing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people walk in memory of laura","story":"The NHS Tayside Continence Advisory and Treatment Service took part in a team sponsored walk around Fe to raise funds in memory of nursing colleague Laura Balfour, who died of septicaemia.The charity FEAT was founded in memory of Falkirk based GP Dr Fiona Agnew and her baby daughter Isla, who both died after contracting sepsis in August .FEAT aims to stop sepsis through funding research into the early detection of the condition and raising awareness of the illness.Lisa Henry, specialist nurse at Wallacetown Health Centre in Dundee, said: “Laura’s colleagues past and present attended the walk and wore bright colours to remember her by.“The sun was shining on the day and everyone who participated was glad to support Laura’s family in raising awareness and funds for septicaemia in her memory.”The team, pictured, raised £, in total.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on

He went into self-imposed exile in the United States following the ascension of Prince Mohammed, now next in line to succeed his father, the -year-old King Salman.Mr Khashoggi was known for his interviews and travels with Osama bin Laden between  and , including in Afghanistan, where he wrote about the battle against the Soviet occupation. In the early s, he tried to persuade bin Laden to reconcile with the Saudi royal family andhome from his base in Sudan, but the al-Qaida leader refused.Mr Khashoggi maintained ties with Saudi elites and was viewed as a link between the West and the often opaque royal court. As a contributor to the Post, Mr Khashoggi has written extensively about Saudi Arabia, including criticising its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of womenrsquos rights activists after the lting of a ban on women driving.What happened to him Mr Khashoggi, whose th birthday was on Saturday, went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbulrsquos th Levent neighbourhood on September  seeking documents so he could be married to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He was told toto the consulate on October  to pick up those documents, Ms Cengiz says.Surveillance footage later aired on Turkish state television shows Mr Khashoggi walking into the consulate at .pm on October . A little less than two hours later, surveillance footage shows several vehicles with diplomatic licence plates move from the consulate to the consulrsquos home some . miles away.Ms Cengiz, who spent hours waiting for Mr Khashoggi outside while holding his mobile phones, says her fiance never walked out of the consulate to meet her. Surveillance footage shows her pacing around outside at .pm, speaking on her phone. No footage made public so far has shown Mr Khashoggi walking out of the consulate.What is Turkey saying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, and Saudi Arabiarsquos King Salman embrace each other in  Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation, say they fear Saudi Arabia killed Mr Khashoggi. They claim they have audio and video recordings of Mr Khashoggi being interrogated, killed and dismembered. However, no such recordings have been released publicly so far.Turkish security officials, rather than holding news conferences, have leaked information through pro-government media. Newspapers published the names and photographs of  Saudi men in the countryrsquos military and security services who are said to have formed an ldquoassassination squad sent to target Mr Khashoggi. Turkish officials told The Associated Pressone of those men was a post-mortem expert.Turkish media have also released a series of videos, apparently taken from surveillance cameras, showing the alleged Saudi agents arriving on private jets the day Mr Khashoggi disappeared, checking into and out of hotels near the consulate, and then flying out that night.A Turkish newspaper also claimed that Mr Khashoggirsquos Apple Watch recorded audio of his slaying and transmitted it to his iPhone outside the consulate and to his iCloud account. However, the newspaper did not explain how the alleged recording was transmitted and included a claim that Mr Khashoggirsquos assailants used his finger to unlock it when such watches do not have fingerprint ID scanners.Turkish officials have not responded to questions from the AP about Mr Khashoggirsquos Apple Watch. Analysts have suggested Turkey may be trying to protect its intelligence-gathering methods by leaking information this way.What is Saudi Arabia saying It is amazing how the #Saudinarrative has changed.

They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution. However, I think we really need to take a stand on this one.Mr McNeill added: ldquoI think we need to be clear that it will have a major impact on our community. Not just on schools, or traffic, but GPs and our health, the environment, the cemetery.ldquoI just feel thatwe donrsquot object to this application now, I donrsquot think I can continually voice my concerns about traffic and the impact on the community. I think itrsquos time for us to take a stand.ldquoBy objecting, we are making our views known, and itrsquos a view shared by many in Tranent.ldquoMaybe a lot of people donrsquot want to be vocal about it, but I do think itrsquos an opportunity that we cannot miss.ldquoI do think as a community we need to be sending a clear message out. Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian. You have Ormiston which has doubled or trebled in size, yoursquore going to have all these houses on the south side, and theyrsquore all still going to go down Tranent High Street. Nobody drives into North Berwick or Dunbar through the main street. Tranent is totally dferent.ldquoAnother  houses will all go through the main street in Tranent and thatrsquos the point wersquove got to get across.Fellow TECC member David Thomson added: ldquoEast Lothian Council made a statement about April, that there was no need to improve the infrastructure.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness.

He went into self-imposed exile in the United States following the ascension of Prince Mohammed, now next in line to succeed his father, the -year-old King Salman.Mr Khashoggi was known for his interviews and travels with Osama bin Laden between  and , including in Afghanistan, where he wrote about the battle against the Soviet occupation. In the early s, he tried to persuade bin Laden to reconcile with the Saudi royal family andhome from his base in Sudan, but the al-Qaida leader refused.Mr Khashoggi maintained ties with Saudi elites and was viewed as a link between the West and the often opaque royal court. As a contributor to the Post, Mr Khashoggi has written extensively about Saudi Arabia, including criticising its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of womenrsquos rights activists after the lting of a ban on women driving.Mr Khashoggi, whose th birthday was on Saturday, went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbulrsquos th Levent neighbourhood on September  seeking documents so he could be married to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He was told toto the consulate on October  to pick up those documents, Ms Cengiz says.Surveillance footage later aired on Turkish state television shows Mr Khashoggi walking into the consulate at .pm on October . A little less than two hours later, surveillance footage shows several vehicles with diplomatic licence plates move from the consulate to the consulrsquos home some . miles away.Ms Cengiz, who spent hours waiting for Mr Khashoggi outside while holding his mobile phones, says her fiance never walked out of the consulate to meet her. Surveillance footage shows her pacing around outside at .pm, speaking on her phone. No footage made public so far has shown Mr Khashoggi walking out of the consulate.Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation, say they fear Saudi Arabia killed Mr Khashoggi. They claim they have audio and video recordings of Mr Khashoggi being interrogated, killed and dismembered. However, no such recordings have been released publicly so far.Turkish security officials, rather than holding news conferences, have leaked information through pro-government media. Newspapers published the names and photographs of  Saudi men in the countryrsquos military and security services who are said to have formed an ldquoassassination squad sent to target Mr Khashoggi. Turkish officials told The Associated Pressone of those men was a post-mortem expert.Turkish media have also released a series of videos, apparently taken from surveillance cameras, showing the alleged Saudi agents arriving on private jets the day Mr Khashoggi disappeared, checking into and out of hotels near the consulate, and then flying out that night.A Turkish newspaper also claimed that Mr Khashoggirsquos Apple Watch recorded audio of his slaying and transmitted it to his iPhone outside the consulate and to his iCloud account. However, the newspaper did not explain how the alleged recording was transmitted and included a claim that Mr Khashoggirsquos assailants used his finger to unlock it when such watches do not have fingerprint ID scanners.Turkish officials have not responded to questions from the AP about Mr Khashoggirsquos Apple Watch. Analysts have suggested Turkey may be trying to protect its intelligence-gathering methods by leaking information this way.It is amazing how the #Saudi narrative has changed.

The Qatar-funded satellite network Al-Jazeera has extensively focused on Mr Khashoggirsquos disappearance over the last week.A Saudi-owned satellite news channel, meanwhile, has begun referring to the alleged -man team as ldquotourists, without providing evidence to support the claim.President Donald Trump has threatened ldquosevere punishmentauthorities determine Saudi Arabia was behind Mr Khashoggirsquos disappearance.

I crept downstairs one night in the early s and opened the door to the living room without my mum and dad knowing. A film was on TV ndash this was during the glory days of the BBCrsquos late night weekend Horror Double Bill.It was The Masque of the Red Death ndash which I now declare to be the greatest horror film ever made. It was wild, terrying, demented. A man in a gorilla suit was burned alive by a dwarf, Death walked the Earth, nobles partied within the walls of a castle as the plague raged outside. It blew my tiny mind and scared me witless, but I kept silent, hidden behind the sofa, as I knew it was taboo andmy parents realised I was there, theyrsquod send me to bed.On screen was an actor I would come to love ndash Vincent Price as the evil Prince Prospero. My parents only discovered I was there when the National Anthem started playing, and they turned on the lights and found me, goggle-eyed like some creepy imp in flannel pyjamas.Irsquove spent the rest of my le watching horror films ndash so as the witching season approaches, and the latest Halloween movie gets ready to open in cinemas, I thought Irsquod give you a guide to the secrets of the genre ndash and tell you what really makes a fright flick tick.THE WOODSIt doesnrsquot have to be the woods ndash though it often is ndash but location is as important to a horror movie as it is to Kirsty Allsopp and Phil Spencer. Think of Jonathan Harkerrsquos journey to Transylvania ndash a scene which opens countless Dracula films. The mountains, the inn, the forest, the wolves, the fog, the night ... the castle. A Dracula movie would be as naked without its classic location as the count without his cape.A great location doesnrsquot have to be some gothic throwback either. Look at An America Werewolf in London ndash it fetishises both the English countryside and the grungy grimy London of the early s ndash or the spaceship in Alien, which becomes a white, pared-back, claustrophobic hunting ground.The ballsiest horrors find the most unlikely location and just go for it ndash all great horror films take enormous risks with everything from script to casting and lightning to sound ndash so how about: a creepy ballet school for girls, soaked in vivid technicolour, in Dario Argentorsquos Suspiria a ski lt in Frozeninside a grave in Buried a railway carriage in Train to Busana punk rock venue in The Green Room, or a locked house in Donrsquot Breathe.None of these films would workthe director had chosen another setting ndash the setting is as important as the characters, the killings, and the creeps that the films wring from you.THE JUMPSHave you ever caught the Luton Bus  Or rather the Lewton Bus  If yoursquove watched the s movie Cat People by Val Lewton then yoursquoll know what I mean.In one scene we see our heroine being hunted by a killer we expect to turn into a panther at any moment. The tension builds and just when wersquore sure itrsquos all going to end in blood and fur, a bus screeches by making viewers leap from their seats. Therersquos no murder, no mayhem ndash but it is famously the scariest part of the film. If you donrsquot jump at least once in a horror movie, whatrsquos the point, most fans would say  We come to be scared.Bad directors use music to make you jump ndash a screeching violin is not a scare ndash or cliche, like Jason Voorhees ndash the killer in the Friday the th franchise ndash leaping up from the dead just when we think wersquore safe. Great film-makers like Lewton use your mind to make you jump, nothing .What a good jump scare depends on is sudden unexpected movement ndash tapping into that fear we have of something unexplained glimpsed from the corner of your eye. Look at the \"Sloth\" scene in Seen: the camera lingers over a shrivelled body which police have found tied to a bed. Suddenly, the \"corpse\" moves, struggling in its bonds. The entire set-up is overturned ndash a body we thought was dead, isnrsquot.The switch itself implies something ghastly: whatever is on the bed has been suffering for months in agony. In one split-second, David Fincher physically and emotional terrorises us.Perhaps, the greatest jump scare is in the much underrated The Exorcist III where a satanic killer is on the loose. One two-minute scene features a static long shot of a hospital hall. A nurse is making her rounds at night ndash her red cardigan the only colour on screen.Nothing  happens ndash but we know something has to happen, this is a horror movie. Just as the audience is lulled into a sense of calm, a shroud-draped man with a giant pair of medical shears ndash the kind used for amputations ndash charges at the nurse from behind.I remember audibly screaming in the cinema in  at this scene ... I loved it.THE MONSTERThere are three main types of baddie in horror films: the Monster, the Psycho, and the Thing. Letrsquos start with the monster.First of all, the Monster isnrsquot human and thatrsquos whatrsquos frightening. Whether itrsquos the shark in Jaws, whatever the hell is in the woods in The Blair Witch Project, the house in The Haunting of Hill House, giant ants in the s creature feature Them!, the xenomorph in Alien, or the demons from The Mist ndash these monsters are relentless. They will not stop ndash and we cannot fathom what drives them, beyond a desire to kill, yet they also possess a preternatural human-like intelligence.Monsters create unanswered questions ndash and ignorance means fear: Why is this shark out for revenge  What is running wild in the woods  Why wonrsquot the house stop shaking  Why are those ants the size of a Ford Focus  Why is that alien hugging my face  What are demons doing in a suburban supermarket The Monster works on the fear of the unknown, or the ugly ndash fear of the non-human. The Monster plays on those deep-seated fears we experience as children ndash the creature under the bed at night, or something beneath your feet when yoursquore swimming.THE PSYCHOThe Psycho, however, works on the opposite emotion ndash the fear of fellow humans, that behind our smiles and civilised cappuccinos lie salivating lunatics eager to kill.What better place to start with the Psycho, then, than with Hitchcockrsquos Norman Bates. The original Psycho was based on a real murderer ndash a necrophile, mother-killing, grave-robbing Wisconsin weirdo called Ed Gein .The roots of the Psycho always lie in reality ndash thatrsquos the fear factor. Could we one day meet such killers in real le  Might we already know a Hannibal Lecter, the urbane cannibal psychiatrist with a nose for good perfume and an eye for cheap shoes a Patrick Bateman, the boardroom American Psycho a Jack Torrance from The Shining ndash the intellectual family man about to snap and kill.THE THINGWhen it comes to the Thing, itrsquos all about the Uncanny Valley ndash the psychological theory that when something resembles a human being closely, but just not quite enough, it elicits a horrible feeling of dread.Think of Nosferatursquos spindly long-fingered decaying fiend, the creature in the attic in Rec, Frankensteinrsquos creation bolted together from scraps of corpses, any zombie, the demonic Cenobites from Hellraiser, the baby in Eraserhead, possessed Regan in The Exorcist, even Hal from : A Space Odyssey.These creatures almost look like us, or in Halrsquos case sound like us, but we know they are not us ndash and so they scare the daylights out of us.THE SALLYIt was once standard operating procedure in horror films that there would always be a survivor ndash usually a woman, known in the industry by the slightly sexist term \"The Last Girl\".I prefer to call this survivor character \"The Sally\" in homage to the female lead in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sally Hardesty, played by s scream queen Marilyn Burns. Texas is loved and hated in equal measure. Horror fans hail it as the darkest and cleverest of the ultra-violent classic slasher films.PhDs have been written on Texas. Itrsquos even been interpreted as a comment on Watergate ndash the deranged hill billy cannibal serial killers do live in a big \"white house\" after all. People who donrsquot watch horror films, though, detest Texas as little more that snuff-inspired torture porn.Director Tobe Hooper put his Sally character through hell at the hands of Leatherface, grandpa and the rest of the slavering clan. When I first watched Texas during the s video nasty era, I felt physically broken afterwards ndash the violence, the terror, the bestial nature of what was happening on screen literally overwhelmed me.But Sally survived ndash and because Sally survived, good won the day. Horror films often rely on such simply fairy tale tricks ndash make me feel scared but then offer hope that what scared me will be defeated and the result is Pavlovian, punters come back for more.Sally led to Laurie Strode, the lead character in the original  Halloween. Now Laurie is dferent to Sally. Sally does a lot of running and screaming and crying ndash Laurie does a lot of running and hiding and trying to breath quietly in cupboards, but then something very important happens: Laurie turns on the killer, the villain Michael Myers.In fact, at one point, we think shersquos killed Myers, clad in his creepy William Shatner face mask . But, in a tradition that Halloween basically forged, the bogeyman lives to kill another day. Nevertheless, he was still vanquished, for the time being at least, by the female protagonist who remains standing.Sometimes, though, The Sally doesnrsquot survive ndash a development seen increasingly in films with a strong artistic bent. In the nihilistic masterpiece Funny Games, Michael Hanekersquos Pinteresque descent into hell, the end is one of deliberate despair ndash no-one will live, and the killers are coming for you next.THE SEXESUnsurprisingly, given that horror exploits our real fears, most villains are men. Horror movies draw very heavily on a primordial battle of the sexes theme: the brutal killer, often a mere personication of evil, versus the sparky, clever woman pushed to the limits of endurance.However, not all horror films conform to the genre. Some switch, and the female villain is far from unknown ndash but when you analyse why the woman is a killer, itrsquos for very dferent reasons to the men.Women donrsquot pick up chainsaws and go on mindless murder sprees ndash women killers tend to act out psychologically, and that can can often create the greatest of screen villains. For proof, enter Annie Wilkes from Misery, an obsessive fan with a fine line in moral rectitudeand a taste for torture.In recent decades, more women began to pop up who should have been put in a straitjacket from birth. Therersquos Lola Stone in The Loved Ones ndash a girl you donrsquot want to invite to a house party Tina, a murderous National Trust nerd, in Ben Wheatleyrsquos black comedy of modern manners Sightseers and Marie, the worst best friend a girl ever asked for in the French new wave horror Switchblade Romance.Carrie is probably the most nuanced female character in any horror film ndash she is both villain and victim. Abused by a religious maniac mother, bullied and sexually humiliated by her classmates, Sissy Spacek as Carrie becomes the revenge prototype of teen female anger.Increasingly, wersquore beginning to see men enter the role of the victim. Take the Belgian movie The Ordeal. Instead of a woman held captive by a male predator, it is a man who is imprisoned and tormented: a good way to bring home to the audience that often the gaze in horror films is on female suffering.THE MEANINGA great horror film has to say something ndash an awful horror film just drips blood all over the cinema seat and leaves you as unsatisfied as a ten pound box of popcorn. By \"saying something\", I donrsquot mean art house pretension ndash I mean that a horror movie must resonate with its times.Horror is the most mutable of genres, apart from comedy. People have fallen in love for the same reasons since time immemorial, people have sought revenge for the same reasons since time immemorial, but jokes change from one day to the next. Horror also changes, not because what scares us changesbut because for horror to work it must relate to you and the fears of the time in which you live.Yoursquoll not be scared by Little Red Riding Hood, but centuries ago it terried your ancestors. Whats needed to scare modern viewers is something that echoes in our real lives ndash think of all those s B movies rfing off the unseen menace of reds under the bed like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Cronenbergrsquos body-horror movies, like The Fly, driven by the fear of technology there was even a spate of post-s hippie horrors in the wake of the Manson family killings like Last House on the Left.Probably the two best examples of horror movies tapping into modern fears come in the shape of Eden Lake, and Ils . Eden Lake uses fear of the dispossessed to get its hooks into viewers. It makes the viewer wonderthe poor, the uneducated, the forgotten will one day rise up and kill them.This is the horror of the housing estate. It is a brutal take on what happens when the suburban middle classes rub up against the \"underclass\".Ils ndash Them ndash is similar in tone but here it is children who are the terror. It prods at the hidden adult fear that children could quite easily killthey wished. Wersquove seen terrible crimes committed by bored, abused, forgotten children unfold in our papers and on the TV news ndash this film seems to say,you beat a dog long enough it will bite you back, no matter how weak it is.Irsquom not trying to convince anyone that horror is art ndash though as a fan of horror movies, I do think the genre is capable of high art when at its very best.In a strange way, what horror can do is make you feel alive because it makes you confront death. Thatrsquos probably what I realised in my four-year-old mind back in the early s when Vincent Price scared the pants off me in The Masque of the Red Death.As the old toast goes from The Bride of Frankenstein: \"To a new world of Gods and Monsters!\""},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-mops-up-after-storm-callum","story":"Scotland is mopping up after Storm Callum, which brought heavy rain and flooding to swathes of the country.A Met Office yellow \"be aware\" alert for the south west of the country, the Lothians, Borders and Strathclyde areas was lted at midnight.

I saw a white BMW hit the central reservation on the M, about a mile from the junction with the M. There was a lot of standing water on the roads, with pools of water gathering in some places.On the transport network, some rail services were hit by delays, with the weather affecting the route between Preston and Scotland.Strong winds also saw speed restrictions imposed on many routes - with reduced Virgin services between London Euston, Birmingham New Street, and Edinburgh and Glasgow, Network Rail said.One of the worst affected areas in the UK was the village of Aberdulais in Neath Port Talbot where residents were ordered to evacuate their homes due to rising river levels amid reports of the worst floods there for  years.Meanwhile in the town of Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons national park, where the River Usk burst its banks, some properties were also flooded, with up to ft of water.High winds brought by Storm Callum delayed the start of fracking at a site in Lancashire.Work was expected to get under way at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, near Blackpool on Saturday after an environmental campaigner failed in a High Court bid to block operations.But energy firm Cuadrilla said fracking had been postponed until Monday as the region felt the effects of Storm Callum.Meanwhile, fresh landslips on Friday caused by Storm Callum as it swept the west of Scotland will keep the Rest and be Thankful closed over the weekend.Heavy rain and strong winds brought  tonnes of debris from the hillside on to the A in Argyll and Bute on Friday as operators tried to clear landslips from earlier in the week.The closure has caused a ersion for motorists.

Icke ndash who preferred to be called ldquoSon of the Godhead at the time ndash had failed to ingratiate himself to the bemused host, perhaps regretfully kicking off the chat by informing Wogan that the moon was a hollow alien spaceship.Personal eccentricities aside,it turns out Icke was correct about whatrsquos now dubbed the ldquoSimulation Argument, we all owe him an apology. The turquoise shellsuit and mullet remain utterly unforgivable, of course.Although this increasingly popular theory was first mooted by Greek philosopher Plato in BC then sweetened for popular consumption by The Matrix, itrsquos Oxford academic Nick Bostromrsquos recent paper supporting the concept that has lent it some heavyweight credibility.Respected US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson gives it ldquobetter than - odds that the simulation hypothesis is correct. ldquoI wish I could summon a strong argument against it, but I can find none, is his unsettling conclusion. Impish billionaire futurist Elon Musk has also mused ndash to a chorus of groans from Tesla shareholders ndash that wersquore ldquomost likely in a simulation. It must be noted, however, that Musk was recently filmed smoking a rather large cannabis joint.If the Simulation Argument is indeed accurate, it means everything we understand as empirical, objective reality ndash the entire universe ndash may actually have only sprung into existence a millisecond ago. Like someone firing up their Xbox for a shot of Assassinrsquos Creed. Our memories saved data, surroundings a hologram and bodies simply avatars, programmed to perceive a notion of forward-movement we call ldquotime. This serves to anchor our ldquothoughts and allows us a concept of ldquofuture for an illusionary sense of ldquoself.But breathe, itrsquos not all bad news ndash the theory allows for one possibility that accepts yoursquore actually real. In fact, it suggests you are actually all that exists within this particular articial reality and that everything in the universe is simply the creation of your mind.This rather egotistical belief system is known as solipsism and sceptics who are  percent convinced of their own existence should note there are no definitive philosophical rebuttals to the theory. Itrsquos certainly a tragedy I canrsquot convince you of my own existence, even when my picture appears right next to these words. If you are indeed the one who is dreaming all this up, please note Irsquod appreciate a less ridiculous hairdo.Soit turns out the entire universe is just an infinitely isible virtual reality where molecules are pixels, itrsquos likely our lives are simply some computer game played by alien children. And I suspect those who controlled the avatars of Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare and Prince used cheat codes.Compute the mind of GodIF any of these unsettling musings truly reflect reality, then this simulationrsquos coding for irony is certainly in need of a debug this week.Researchers from the University of Basque in Spain are currently embarking upon a new venture to reveal the true nature of the universe ndash using, yes, a computer. They do say it takes a thief to catch a thief.Itrsquos actually doubly ironic that it is shiny new ldquoquantum computers that are being used to ldquorecreate the origin of Darwinian evolution.This is because events in quantum physics have a truly inexplicable and weird way of being influenced by observation ndash like a tree in the woods only falling when someone can see it. Some scientists believe such oddness at the molecular level of reality may be an actual quirkinside our simulation.These Spanish researchers, however, are clearly aware of the potential irony of asking a computer to essentially explain and understand itself. ldquoWe leave open the question whether the origin of le is genuinely quantum mechanical, confirmed one of the scientists involved, rather cryptically.Perhaps itrsquos no coincidence New Yorker magazine recently reported two unnamed tech billionaires have employed a number of scientists to work out how to break them out of the simulation using quantum computers.QUANTUM OF SOLACESo whatrsquos so special about these quantum computers compared to that shiny new Macbook you only use for surfing the net and assimilating into societys higher social tiers  Well, the truth is even those who construct quantum computers dont really understand the dference. But they believe the chasm is seismic.Todayrsquos mass market machines compute using an internal binary language of s and s, while quantum machines also have a third potential state that lies, well hellip somewhere in between. Because of this, their computational units ndash known as quibits ndash have the special ability to become \"entangled\" with other quibits. After entering such a relationship, quibits will then instantly reflect any changes in its lsquotwinrsquo.Why does this weird lsquomirroring matter  Well, many particle physicists believe itrsquos an action that actually takes place outside of what we perceive as spacetime. This is because distance seems to be no barrier to quibitsrsquo instant communication. And now, were slowly learning how to harness this ability in order to create machines of almost infinite computing power. Simply, your Macs s and s are very slow and the timeless dimension in-between is not. Forget that thing Richard Pryor created in Superman , wersquore talking machines as powerful as the Transformersrsquo home planet of Cybertron.LOOKING FOR LUCAIT may be the case that quantum machines donrsquot discover a simulation at the root of reality, but actually confirm that Darwinian evolution all boils down to the mysterious ancient leform known as LUCA .What makes this great granny of all things especially fascinating is that it had the chance of eternal le ndash but decided to die so we could live. Just like Jesus four billion years later.Most evolutionary biologists are convinced that everything that has ever existed originates from LUCA, and a genetic portrait was recently created by evolutionary biologists at the Heinrich Heine University in Duumlsseldorf. Apparently this oddity existed in deep sea vents on the magma-drenched, celestial baby Earth and was unlike anything  that has ever existed ndash a spindling conglomeration of tiny cells that spent hundreds of millions of years simply chilling in the sea doing nothing. Blind, deaf yet perhaps not so dumb.Itrsquos notable that gender or death did not exist on Earth until LUCA unzipped itself to kick off evolution, shuffling around its genetics using some mysterious early form of osmosis.Why this organism died to unleash its essential ingredients and create all le on this planet remains a deep, abiding mystery. Or perhaps LUCA was simply an alien virus in our simulation, programmed to self-destruct and seed this virtual Earth with avatars. If so, the creators of this particular illusion are playing a very long game indeed.AND FINALLY hellipEXPANDING further upon Oxford philosopher Nick Bostromrsquos recent Simulation Theory paper, whatrsquos particularly striking is its casual assumption of many long-lived alien civilisations existing out there.If these beings run computer simulations ndash and they will, says Bostrom ndash then articial realities must be abundant throughout the universe. The problem is, these alien programmers would ndash like us ndash have no idea whether theyrsquore part of a simulation themselves. Every universe may simply be a Russian doll trapped within the darkness of another ndash an artical multiverse.Yet,we are indeed living in the root level of reality, perhaps our universal common ancestor LUCA was still a computer virus of sorts ndash one that sacriced its original form to set evolution in motion, hoping to gain a multi-dimentional perspective of reality through the eyes of everything that has ever lived and died on Earth.From the birds in the sky to fungus in the fields, LUCA is likely hiding in plain sight, with infinite perceptions of reality at its disposal to understand and conquer its planet completely.And when its greatest achievement ndash humans ndash finally blast off to the stars, the entire universe awaits."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-to-embark-on-first-royal-tour-as-couple","story":"The royal couple will visit Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand between October  and .Starting on Tuesday, Harry and Meghan will take part in  engagements over their -day trip to the Pacic region.The tour coincides with the Invictus Games in Sydney, which run from October -.The sporting event ndash founded by Prince Harry in  ndash gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball.After landing in Sydney, the duke and duchess will travel to Dubbo and Melbourne, before spending three days in Sydney from October - to mark the launch of the games.

Love Actually, Notting Hill and Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary, scotched chances of a Blackadder revival.ldquoBlackadder is a very, very complicated group of people and soyou are fond enough of the series to wish that the people involved in it should live to a ripe old age then I think it is best that we donrsquot work together, thatrsquos the answer, Curtis said.The screenwriter was speaking during an event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, in which he was interviewed by his daughter Scarlett, who revealed her mother, Emma Freud, has never watched an episode of Blackadder.Curtis explained how he and Atkinson, who himself has gone on to have global success with Mr Bean and Johnny English, dreamt up Blackadder.ldquoBlackadder was in a funny way written out of fear, Curtis said.ldquoSomeone called John Cleese had written a show called Fawlty Towers and when Rowan and I tried to write a modern situation comedy we just knew it was rubbish in comparison to that.ldquoSo we decided to write about history and it really came from two sources, one of which was a series of books called the Ladybird Book of History and the other was the plays of Shakespeare because they were also stupid and people also wore stupid costumes.Curtis added: ldquoI am sorry about the bad episodes they were all written by a guy called Ben Elton.He also gave some tips about his techniques for writing, saying that many wannabe writers give up too early.ldquoThe dference between me and a writer who doesnrsquot go on writing is that I write % good a day and I think that has been a fantastic day and many people give up writing because they write for a day and they have got % of rubbish, he said.ldquoI did once work out I had written , pages to reach Notting Hill which was a -page script.ldquoI think keeping faith and noticing whatrsquos good and I think the edits of movies are unbelievably rigorous and necessary and a few of my films have been not what I dreamed but they were finished.ldquoThe most interesting was Bridget which didnrsquot work at all until we moved the penultimate scene, which was her in absolute despair in her bedroom dressed in red pyjamas drinking and crying, to the title sequence of the movie, which meant you actually felt for Bridget right from the start, which in our original cut you just didnrsquot.ldquoThere are miraculous things that can happen in the edit.ldquoLove Actually is a bad example because it didnrsquot work at all when we finished it and the one where the finished product was at least like the script I wrote and in fact we had to delay the moviersquos release by three months to just start again."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt-goes-on-for-man-who-subjected-young-student-to-terrifying-ordeal","story":"This summer, on a Glasgow path overgrown by trees, a man first circled a woman and tried to lure her into some woods. Then he exposed himself and began masturbating.His victim, deeply distressed, escaped. So ndash at least for now ndash has he.That is because, weeks after his crime, the man remains at large. Police Scotland say they have ldquono positive line of inquiry, their way of saying they are not pursuing any specic leads. Their investigation, carried out by specialist public protection detectives, ldquoremains open.Officers do not doubt, insiders stress, the credibility and good faith of the victim and their only witness, a then -year-old student. She, however, does doubt them. So much so that in last weekrsquos Herald on Sunday the woman, Caitie Mackay, waived her anonymity to express her hurt and frustration about both the crime and the way she felt it was handled by the police. Her story was powerfully told by her father, The Herald and Herald on Sunday writer-at-large Neil Mackay. Very few victims of sexual offences are able to share their perspective. Fewer still have the courage to do so under their own name.Caitie said she had identied a suspect to the police but that this man had never been interviewed. Why  Because, she was told, he would be unfit to understand the process. Last week, we suggested the man had mental health issues. In fact, we can now report, he has serious learning dficulties.She said the man was stalking her, turning up at her work, one of Glasgowrsquos biggest shopping malls. She did not feel safe. ldquoTrying to get any form of justice or protection is pointless, Caitie said. ldquoI feel aswhat happened to me simply does not matter. My faith in the police is destroyed.Last week, Mackay, profoundly worried about his daughter ndash and about the public interest issues he raised about the investigation of sex crimes ndash put a series of questions to the police. This week we can report how they responded.Officers spoken to by The Herald have great sympathy and respect for Mackay and his daughter. Their perspective on the investigation, is, however, in some details, is at odds with that of the Mackay family.So much so that some of their dferences may have to be resolved by a complaints process already under way thanks to formal interest from a politician following our story last week.Police, specically, say they carried out an extensive investigation in to Caitiersquos complaint ndash which is one of public indecency rather than ldquoa sexual assault, as we termed the offence in a headline last week.They also say there is ldquoinsufficient evidence to link the man with learning dficulties to the case.And they say they have no record of any report of stalking against the man. The Mackays dispute this and are understood to be considering their own formal complaint against the police.The officer in charge of investigating this case is Detective Superintendent Alwyn Bell. He leads Glasgow isionrsquos team of public protection detectives, specialists in sex crimes. It was his unit, he explained, which took over the case shortly after Caitie reported it.Bell said: ldquoFollowing a report of a man having indecently exposed himself near to Darnley train station on July , officers spoke to the victim and carried out a number of inquiries including a full search of the area.ldquoThe inquiry was then allocated to the dedicated Public Protection Unit within the ision, and following a CCTV check and other inquiries, there was no further information available at that time to identy a suspect. However, the inquiry remained open.Bell said that efforts had been made to keep the victim updated on this investigation by phone but added that ldquoofficers were unsuccessful. The detective, who has occupied senior public protection roles in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, also addressed ndash within serious legal limitations on what he can say ndash the concerns the Mackays had over the man identied by Caitie as her attacker.He said: ldquoOn July , the victim made a further call to police reporting that she had seen the suspect within her workplace. Officers attended to speak to her and the suspect was identied by the victim as being the inidual who had carried out the public indecency. ldquoInquiries were undertaken and, due to his behaviour, he was ed home to his parents. Officers then obtained medical advice regarding the suspectrsquos condition and it was made clear by a medical professional that he has signicant learning dficulties, and therefore lacks the capacity to understand a police interview or the ramications of his actions or conduct.The man is on Police Scotlandrsquos vulnerable persons database or VPD. He has been the subject of some inquiries. However, the force, in a formal statement to The Herald on Sunday, said they currently do not have a positive line of inquiry in the case.Bell added: ldquoThe inquiry into this incident remains open and we would ask anyone who has any information which may assist, to contact us.The story centres on some of the trickiest and most sensitive areas of police work: updating victims on live investigations and handling inquiries which touch on vulnerable people.There can be legal, ethical and practical reasons why officers cannot share the full story of any live inquiry to complex, messy, human crimes with journalists, the relatives of adult victims and victims themselves. There can also be miscommunications and misunderstandings between police and those whose lives are affected by crime and its investigation.The circumstances of this case now look likely to be settled by a formal independent process of complaints.Police Scotland has faced complaints about such issues before, including those which have been upheld and those which have not been. Each such complaint, say insiders, offers a chance to learn lessons or get to the bottom of a dispute.The force in recent years has also increasingly secured the trust of organisations which support victims of sex crimes. Whatever the outcome of formal concerns about the Mackay case, the force will be eager to rebuild trust among victims and their families. Dfering perspectives on the course of the investigation aside, insiders stress they see Caitie as a good faith witness.Senior officers in recent years have put huge public emphasis on a message that they want to hear reports of sexual offences. Last financial year they recorded nearly , such crimes, more than double the historic norm. Numbers continue to rise this year, early reports suggest. In -, there were  cases of public indecency, the kind of offence experienced by Caitie.Somebody, police are sure, put Caitie through a terrying ordeal on July . That somebody has not been caught. There have not been any reports of similar crimes in the area. However, the man who tormented Caitie may well have exposed himself to others. If you were one of those women, or have any information about who the man might be, contact Police Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-unveil-common-sense-brexit-plans","story":"The publication, due out on Monday, will reinforce the case for continued membership of the single market and customs union, Scotlands First Minister said.It will also argue that the UK Governments \" choice\" between a \"bad, possibly blindfold\" Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario should not be accepted.The release of the paper will come as the First Minister gives a speech at the Royal Society of Artsin London on Monday.Speaking in advance of the address, Ms Sturgeon said: \"The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union less than six months from now -

It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.This was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in the Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported. HIErsquos attitude changed thereafter and the agency in the end contributed pound,, as well as giving the Assynt Crofters advice and encouragement.Other communities, such as Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha followed. Now well over , acres are under community ownershipTHE CLEARANCES CONTROVERSIESThe Assynt crofters drive to take back their land reflected generations of hurt over who owns Scotland - and the Clearances of the poor, often Gaelic-speaking, from the Highlands in the centuries after Culloden.This year the historian Sir Tom Devine has revisited the issue and claried that the Clearances were far from just a Highland issue, taking issue with the traditional take of popular historian John Prebble, who Mr Ross knew.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross looks at the legacy of Mr Prebble, whose work was once dismissed by a late historiographer royal as ldquoutter rubbish.Mr Ross said: ldquoWhether or not the Highlands and Islands suffered worse depopulation numerically compared to other parts of Scotland, I have never felt was the most important issue. Rather it was the impact on the people, which Sorley MacLean described as the ldquophenomenon of phenomena.Mr MacLean was Mr Rossrsquos father-in-law and his book includes praise to the late bard which Mr Ross says he would have found ldquoexcruciating.TONGUE LASHINGMr Ross back in  came in for a not always gentle Fleet Street ribbing when he was covering the manhunt for a -year-old girl and her -year-old boyfriend. He spotted the pair near Tongue but called the police rather than try to get a scoop and speak to them.In his book, the reporter explains that ethical rules of his trade meant he could not interview a child without a responsible adult present. The man with the girl, he says, was the ldquoantithesis of a responsible adult.Highland Herald: Reporting The News From The North is published on Wednesday by Birlinn ."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie saved from a96 dual plans","story":"The option to create a dual carriageway through the Bennachie area has been scrapped by the Scottish Government.It has been removed following initial design and assessment work, and also feedback from the public.Initial options removed include the existing A Inverurie Bypass and the offline southern route between east of Huntly and Blackburn, which passes through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area.Local communities and road users in the Inverurie area have the chance to see and comment on the options being taken forward for further design as the Scottish government looks to identy a preferred route option next year.Public exhibitions will be held at Inverurie Town Hall todayand tomorrow , and residents in Huntly will get to have their say on Wednesdayat Stewarts Hall.

This includes those near Bennachie and those through Inverurie on the existing A.”The removal of the plan to upgrade the A through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area has been welcomed by Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin.Last month, Ms Martin welcomed campaigners from the Save Bennachie group to meet with new Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss their concerns.The group also previously met with then Economy Minister Keith Brown earlier this year to discuss their opposition to the plans.Ms Martin MSP said: “I am thrilled Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has confirmed the route passing Bennachie has now been dropped.“The Save Bennachie group have tirelessly campaigned and shown true passion and dedication for their cause.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of the Kemnay Academy Rock Challenge Team accept the donation from Lynn Murphy of Tesco\"  Bags of Help cash for pupils viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“I commend them all for a campaign which has been time-consuming and, those who were a part of it, for their commitment and determination.“They managed to achieve cross-party support and I know MSPs from all parties shared a collective admiration for them.“I would like to thank the Transport Minister and Transport Scotland for all their work to date and for taking the time to meet with myself, other MSPs and the Save Bennachie team to listen to their views.

Sands helpline operates from .am to .pm Monday to Friday and pm to pm Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Sands is leading a coalition of more than  charities working to prevent baby deaths and pregnancy loss. Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK. It works to reduce baby deaths through promoting better maternity care and funding research. The charity offers training and comprehensive bereavement support, both nationally through its helpline –    or via email at helpline@sands.org.uk – and locally via some  regional support groups.Further information can be found at www.sands.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"ne charity marks 30 years","story":"A charity which supports adults with learning disabilities and additional support needs in Inverurie has kicked off a year of celebrations to mark its th anniversary.Aberdeen-headquartered Inspire started le as Partnership Housing in  then became Partnership before adopting its current name in .Service provision began in  when three people moved from Aberdeen’s Woodlands Hospital into their new home in the city’s Fonthill Terrace.Now more than  adults are supported thanks to a range of initiatives in Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray and Angus.Locally, the charity supports  people at St James’s Court and operates Inspire Soaps, a day service where iniduals have the opportunity to make soaps, candles, arts and crafts.To mark the start of its th birthday celebrations, Inspire recently held a special birthday party for corporate supporters, long serving staff and local authority representatives in Inverurie.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector. They say the closure of the toilets would have an environmental and economic impact. A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Monday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117903.jpg","title":"Something old something new","story":"WICK Heritage Museum made history itself at the weekend when a wedding was staged there for the first time.The museum was chosen by happy couple Faith Bramley and Kris Manson because they both share an interest in the history of Wick and enjoy seeing photos of years gone by.Faith, the new Mrs Manson, said: \"Everyone commented on what a lovely and unusual venue it was and thought the centre itself was amazing and atmospheric.\"We couldnt have asked for a better day.\"The feeling inside the centre is special and Ian Leith [chairman of the Wick Society] was so accommodating and helpful.\"When we started discussing the wedding with him we knew it couldnt be anywhere .\"Seventy guests attended the ceremony which was held in the museum on Saturday and followed by a dance in Canisbay hall.Faith, a dental nurse, added: \"Our heartfelt thanks go to Ian for his time and to his wonderful group of volunteers that helped out on the day.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision.

This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival from . am with the day starting at . am. A soup and sandwich lunch will be served at .pm after the event ends.To book your place in this free event, contact Age Scotland on    or helen.simpson@agescotland.org.uk by October .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online.

But the work is very intensive and requires the repeated closure of the vital road link multiple times every day.A road-rail ersion onto the neighbouring railway tracks has been created to allow key through-access for cars but this can only operate during gaps in rail services ndash causing serious disruption to drivers who miss those windows. At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption.

I see a bright future for the town, now things are starting to move forward,\" she said.This was echoed by long-serving Invergordon hairdresser Sharon Mitchell. She agreed more houses were desperately needed but said more shops must follow because the town centre was sorely lacking its yesteryear \"buzz\".\"It used to be thriving here but itrsquos Alness thatrsquos thriving now.

It also can help people buy a new-build home from a council or housing association.Ms Mitchell said: \"A LIFT scheme would be the best.

These were the northern end of the Cromlet site, opposite the rugby club and the farmland at Davidson Drive, surrounding the farm buildings.\"Both landowners were approached and the latter is under discussion.\"She added: \"Invergordon has so much to offer in terms of employment, both atthe base and industrial estates, as well as the cruise sector, which is growing, but people need a decent roof over their heads.\"By encouraging inward-migration and moving around within the town we also encourage the economics to grow, so more people means more people in the town shopping and more new shopping ideas popping up as there would be people to use them.\"In latter years, Invergordonrsquos population has settled around the  mark, whereas Alness has grown to just over .\"It is time this balanced-out and allowed both towns to be more equal in terms of shopping experiences.\"Monday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Stem cell research hit the headlines earlier this week after Glaswegian comedian Sir Billy Connolly revealed he would participate in a pioneering Hard University study which aims to use stem cells to find a cure for Parkinson’s. Censo said it has a “rapidly expanding” portfolio of major drug company clients choosing to outsource this specialised research, including some of the best known pharmaceutical and biotech companies across Europe, the US and Japan.The research firm plans to use the £.m investment to accelerate business growth, expand its marketing and sales capabilities, and broaden the range of commercial research services it provides to clients.The funding will be provided by three sources: Edinburgh-based venture capital firm Par Equity’s Par Syndicate EIS Fund, which invests in young, innovative technology companies the Par Syndicate, which is a network of specially selected expert investors and the Scottish Investment Bank. Aidan Courtney, chief executive at Censo, said: “This investment from Par Equity has come at exactly the right time for the company. “Over the past two years we have developed a comprehensive suite of resources which allow us to create human stem cells from any inidual and use derivatives of these cells to test drugs for clients. “Our focus on selected research areas, such as neuro-inflammation, has aligned extremely well with our clients’ needs and we are seeing more demand than we can accommodate with our current resources. “Par Equity’s investment will allow us to broaden our service offering and accelerate growth.”Paul Munn, partner at Par Equity, said: “Our investment gives Censo the capital to build upon its important work, but we’re also very active managers. “We’ll work closely with Censo’s management, drawing on the expertise and experience of our network of investors to give them the support they need to scale up this exciting business, which could help transform treatment of a number of serious diseases.”Censo was founded in  following the merger of Roslin Cellab and Roslin Cell Sciences, and has employs teamsin the Scottish capital and Cambridge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814514.1539583384!/image/image.jpg","title":"christine jardine we need to talk more about grief of losing a baby","story":"It#s probably quite unusual for a politician to use their column to write about a television programme, and one that had nothing whatsoever to do with politics.But this was so much more than a television programme. This was public broadcasting which really did serve a purpose.For the first time in longer than I care to remember, I was desperate to watch something at the first available opportunity that wasn’t about baking, or a comedy or a political show.BBC Alba’s Labour of Love’opened a window on a subject that for too long society has shied away from talking about. And, by hiding away, we denied generations of parents the support and recognition of their grief that they need when they lose their baby.So while at first glance some people might question whether this is an appropriate subject for a politician to comment on, surely this is where we have a responsibility to nurture an understanding and compassion not just in inidual cases, but in society.Last week was Baby Loss Awareness Week. At both Westminster and Holyrood, politicians recognised and debated the topic, with a genuine desire to offer support and empathy and, where possible, foster change.Many of those at the parliamentary events had personal experiences that they shared.Although I have been close to family and friends whose baby has died I still can’t imagine how painful it must have been for them. Or the strength it took for the parents in the programme to relive the trauma they had been through.: Dr Sureshini Sanders: We need to talk about death and griefAnd they did it with a purpose which was completely altruistic. After watching Labour of Love’ I called one of the mothers who had taken part. Annie Lumsden is an old friend.I was her tutor at university, my late husband worked with her and we knew what she and her family were going through at the time.But watching the programme – partly because I knew she would be in it – brought home to me, and possibly many others watching, really for the first time, how little I had appreciated what she had been through when she lost Grace.In the programme, she talked about being told, some years after, that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and how that felt “like a weight being lted from me when someone said that what you’ve been through is a terrible thing”.That made me realise how much more we as a society have to do to help. How much we haven’t yet done.We still need a taking of responsibility and recognition by care services of the support that’s needed.And an understanding that every inidual may need something dferent and for more than just the immediate aftermath.More importantly, Annie told me that talking about it had not only helped all of those who took part, and brought them together, but that it had helped so many others.Quite a lot of older women had, she told me, been in touch since the programme to say how pleased they were that it had been made.I’m glad they had the courage and foresight to do it too.: Richard Meade: Time to get over our hang-ups about death and bereavementBy sharing their personal experiences with us, they have created a public awareness and desire for action. And it is up to those of us in elected positions to ensure that action is carried out.During my career as a journalist, I remember so many issues like this one where an initial opening up led to a change in attitude.It’s not so long ago that we did not talk about mental health issues. We have made progress there, although we have a long way to go yet. Sexuality too was a taboo that is now openly acknowledged and respected.And while it might seem strange to reference them in the same space as the loss of a child, those issues are also personal, traumatic and something we shied away from talking about both as a society and iniduals.One of the things that has struck me throughout this week has been that it is those who have not faced the trauma of losing a child who are less willing to talk about it.We don’t quite know how to broach the subject and yet, as my friend told me, it made such a dference to her when they did.So what now  The danger is that, with Baby Loss Awareness Week behind us, we now move on.We don’t think about it until this time next year. We should not forget that we do not have that luxury.For those it has affected, it will always be there. So please, let’s take that on board. Let’s recognise that there are people in all of our lives who have been through a trauma we cannot appreciate and do what we can to lessen the trauma for those who, heartbreakingly, will have to face it in future.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808184.1539583429!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment blase brexiteers need to think again","story":"Recent polls suggest that a troublingly high percentage of Brexiteers are perfectly willing to pay what we consider to be unacceptably high prices for the UK to leave the EU.When it comes to both the Good Friday Agreement which secured peace in Northern Ireland and Scotland’s continued membership of the UK, a great many Leavers in England have adopted the view thatthese things are weakened by Brexit then that’s le and we shall all have to get on with it.This blasé attitude to such incredibly sensitive issues give us all pause for thought. The issues of Northern Ireland and Scotland after Brexit, though dferent in nature, are inextricably linked. If an arrangement is found which gives Northern Ireland special status and avoids a hard border with the Republic, many on the other side of the Irish Sea will be hugely relieved. But others would be infuriated.Yesterday, it emerged that Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, have threatened to quitthe UK government reaches a compromise over Brexit that threatens to “undermine the integrity” of the UK.The two are said to have made it clear to Prime Minister Theresa May that they would resignNorthern Ireland has a unique deal because such an arrangement would fuel the case for Scottish independence.Leading Brexiteers are fond of saying that “nobody voted for” any of the proposed compromises, such as remaining in a customs union, that might make the Brexit process less painful. This may be so – but nor did anyone vote for a Brexit that threatened peace in Northern Ireland or undermined the integrity of the UK.Yesterday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Davidson and Mundell’s position was “bizarre”. In fact, there is some logic to their stance. From a unionist point of view, any agreement that gave Northern Ireland status denied to Scotland would, inevitably, play into the SNP’s hands.It is the view of The Scotsman that continued peace in Northern Ireland is more important than the delivery of a “hard Brexit”for which nobody explicitly voted.May is under intense pressure from within Conservative ranks to walk away from the EU without a deal. The truth is, however, that she should make the case for the UK remaining within the customs union. The price for leaving it is, we believe, too high.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814896.1539583922!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith nicola sturgeon s hope leaves me without any","story":"If the First Minister#s hopes are all we have to look forward to then we really are in trouble, says Brian Monteith.The word “Hope” worked wonders for Barack Obama. Often it was on his campaign poster instead of his name and his book The Audacity of Hope put him on the electoral map and inspired people around the world. What would using the word “Hope” do for our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her closing address to the SNP conference  The word “Hope” worked wonders for Barack Obama. Often it was on his campaign poster instead of his name and his book The Audacity of Hope put him on the electoral map and inspired people around the world. What would using the word “Hope” do for our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her closing address to the SNP conference  Well, choosing that very word showed she was audacious, but then we knew that already, for blaggers usually are, are they not  What “Hope” could Nicola Sturgeon offer me, I wondered I could hope the First Minister would take a further independence referendum off the table and get back to doing the day job she is paid more than the Prime Minister for doing. I might hope she would reiterate education is her top priority rather than tell us independence transcends all – but I was disappointed beyond hope. Nicola Sturgeon managed to mention education only once in her entire speech but could talk of independence  times – telling us there is still hope for a second independence referendum and still hope she and her fellow separatists can win it.I could hope that in trying to convince sceptical unionists who might be persuaded to switch to her cause she would explain how her new business case for independence, produced by her own Growth Commission, would make independence attractive and possible.Sadly it was not mentioned, indeed it was not debated at the SNP conference at all. Apparently it does not give any cause for hope, unless you hope for its super Scottish austerity recipe that would make anything suffered by Greece look like a Club - holiday.Like Nicola Sturgeon I hope for better things. I hope to see our local authorities properly funded rather than starved of cash, but first I’d have to hope the First Minister could explain why she is cutting council funding when her own budget from Westminster has gone up.I hope to see the falling literacy and numeracy among Scottish children reversed, I hope to see our national performance in maths and science improve to at least where it was before the SNP allowed it to fall, and I hope to see the £ million cut in education restored. Unfortunately I have no hope our First Minister will reverse the negative trends in our schools she talks of priorities but cannot even deliver an Education Bill to parliament and would rather increase budgets to other favoured departments than her claimed first priority of education.I hope to see the growing shortages of nurses and doctors reversed, but first she would have to explain why she cut back on training places for nurses when health secretary, why doctors should be taxed more in Scotland than England and why Scottish pupils with excellent exam grades are being denied places in our own medical schools. These scandals leave me without hope that she is up to the job required.Indeed the ambition of my hope has fallen so low I even hope that one day, sometime within my letime, the Queensferry Crossing will not have to close lanes so the ever-present “snagging” can be attended to. Is that too much to hope I have a long list of improvements to Scottish public services but I no longer hope Nicola Sturgeon has even a scintilla of an idea what to do to improve them for all she appears able to talk about is independence, Brexit and blaming Westminster for her failings.I’m not alone in hoping the First Minister would recognise Brexit presents opportunities that she should maximise to at least mitigate what she sees as the dangers. I could provide her with a list of positive initiatives to take but I don’t hold out any hope of being asked for it.I could hope she would promise to fight to keep our fishermen out of the Common Fisheries Policy, but she promises to hand their hard won freedom back over to Brussels. I could hope she would join the campaign for free ports that could bring thousands of jobs to Prestwick and Grangemouth, but she would rather Scotland was inside the EU’s single market and customs union, which would make it impossible.I often hope that Nicola Sturgeon would stop patronising and disrespecting those who do not share her goals. We are not idiots, we can see when a grievance is being manufactured, we can recognise when she is saying black is white and we find her easy sacrice of good relations with the rest of the UK embarrassing. It gives me no hope that she could run an independent Scotland and ensure cordial relationships with our nearest and most important neighbour.Such is the damage done to Scotland during Nicola Sturgeon’s time in office, from Health Secretary through to First Minister, I hope readers who agree with me about the effrontery of her limited offer of “hope” to only those that follow her – rather than the whole of Scotland – might, when they are given the chance, choose to vote the SNP out of power. More so, I hope the Scottish people will bury their past dferences and vote for any party best placed to defeat sitting SNP MSPs or MPs so we may begin to heal the open wounds and deep ision that has grown in Scottish society since the SNP took office. After all the  hopes, all the dashed hopes, I now only hope for one thing and one thing only. I hope the First Minister in all seriousness stands in front of the mirror to consider her litany of bad judgment calls and asks herself why she has failed on so many counts. She has failed on education, she has failed on health, she is failing on the economy – and by ignoring her day job has left us without hope. If she is then honest with herself, she must recognise her audacity has set back her hope of independence – for which I suppose I should be grateful.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814881.1539550978!/image/image.jpg","title":"universal credit needs 2bn extra says iain duncan smith","story":"The UK government must pump # billion into welfare in this month#s Budget to save its flagship Universal Credit reform, Iain Duncan Smith has said.The architect of the troubled Universal Credit system quit in  over billions being cut from the new benefits scheme.Criticism of the welfare overhaul, which is currently being rolled out nationally, has grown following reports that the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told Cabinet colleagues that claimants could lose as much as £ per month in benefits.Mr Duncan Smith said topping up funding was the only way of reaching the “just about managing” people that Prime Minister Theresa May had promised she would help.He said in a TV interview: “Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street and said, ‘I want to look after those who are just about managing’.“Universal Credit is the single best system to get to those who are just about managing.He added: “The key thing is, the structure works, but we need to put the money in …we do that and get the money back to where it should be, the reality is nobody should lose at all.”SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman called on the Chancellor to halt the scheme when he delivers the Budget at the end of October. She said: “Millions of families have suffered from years of failed Tory austerity cuts that have seen real wages fall, social security payments slashed, living costs rise, and the majority of families left poorer and worse off than they would have been a decade ago.“The Tory government’s record on living standards has been utterly miserable – with rising poverty and inequality, and plans for an extreme ­Brexit that it knows will deliver a body blow to incomes and living costs across Scotland and the UK.”Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said the UC name was now a “toxic brand” and it would be “very hard to rebuild trust in it”.She said: “The problem with Universal Credit now, is, under this government, it is being used to cut people’s benefits – to penalise people for having too many children, to penalise the disabled and other vulnerable people. The notion of a simpler benefits system – great idea, but notyou are adding austerity to it.”Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry called for a root and branch review of Universal Credit.Ms Thornberry said former chancellor George Osborne had used UC as “a vehicle for cuts because it’s so complex you could introduce a whole load of cuts and nobody would notice”.She added: “We must not come out of austerity on the backs of the poor. This is wrong, it’s fundamentally wrong.”Speaking on the same programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the system, saying: “I have seen the Universal Credit in operation in my own constituency, where I have had no letters [about problems] on it at all.“I have sat with the work coaches meeting people who are on Universal Credit and seen how the way that it works means that people can be helped into work much more.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814855.1539542890!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland 1 portugal 3 miserable week ends in defeat","story":"Scotland ended a dficult week in no better shape following a - defeat to Portugal in their low-key friendly at Hampden Park.Alex McLeish made six changes to the side which performed abysmally in the - Nations League defeat to Israel on Thursday night and they performed competently in a half-full stadium only for debutant Helder Costa to score for the visitors just before the break.However, the  European Championship winners, who had an even more unfamiliar look about them, doubled their lead in the rd minute through Eder before Bruma fired in a third with six minutes remaining with Steven Naismith scoring at the death to put a better sheen on the scoreline.Scotland face Albania away and Israel at home next month in their final Nations League Group C games and McLeish, whose side have three points from two games, will have to find some answersthey are to reach the play-offs, which offer the chance of reaching the  European Championships.McLeish needed a decent performance to take some heat off following the trip to Haa.Personnel change was forced upon him as his back-three - John Souttar, Charlie Mulgrew and Kieran Tierney - were unavailable through either injury or fatigue.Craig Gordon, Scott McKenna, Jack Hendry, Stuart Armstrong, James Forrest and Oli McBurnie were brought into the side which was set out in a -- formation.However, Portugal were far from full strength.Head coach Fernando Santos was without their talismanic striker Cristiano Ronaldo, midfielder Bernardo Silva and defender Pepe.And only defender Cedric and Ruben Dias retained their places from Thursday’s - win away to Poland in the Nations League with Wolves forward Costa handed his debut.There was no real hint of a goal until the th minute when Portugal captain and keeper, Beto, had to make a fine reaction save from his own player, Sergio Oliviera, after the Porto midfielder had headed towards his own goal after a Forrest cross which had popped up into the air.McKenna and Naismith had headers which failed to trouble Beto before Portugal threatened through Bruma whose deflected drive just missed the target.In the th minutes Naismith’s header from a tempting Forrest cross missed the far post by a yard.Five minutes later at the other end, Portugal striker Eder escaped McKenna inside the box and fired in a right-footed drive from  yards which was beaten away to safety by Gordon.All the Scots’ good work, however, was undone with two minutes of the first-half remaining when Bruma set up Kevin Rodrigues and his cut-back was knocked into the net from six yards by Costa who got in front of skipper Andy Robertson.Scotland started the second-half positively.Callum McGregor and John McGinn both had attempts on goal before McKenna’s ing header from a McGinn corner just missed the target.As the inevitable substitutions began to flow the tempo dropped and the game became disjointed.However, when substitute Renato Sanches floated a free-kick into the Scotland penalty area Eder’s bullet header from  yards gave Gordon no chance and there was more misery for the Scots when Bruma raced into the box and hammered a drive high past Gordon, rendering Naismith’s close-range finish a consolation.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David.

When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!!

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron.

A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church. Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice. Her funeral is todayat pm in Tullylish Parish Church with committal following in the adjoining graveyard.The funeral dress code is not strictly black.

She said everBODY taught her mechanisms to cope with her illness.Action Mental Health’s Deborah McCready, everyBODY Project Worker said: “AMH everyBODY exists to bridge the gap on the clients’ journey from the moment they seek help until they eventually get to speak to a medical expert, as with existing waiting lists this can be a long time. AMH everyBODY offers a recovery approach in sessions when people will receive information and support to develop skills, stay focused and healthy until they see a therapist.” One service user said: “Speaking out is hard and you get scared that people will judge you, but for the first time I felt like somebody was listening to me and just got it. “I was able to get support for other underlying issues as well as my eating disorder and it helped having someone to explain how to access dferent types of support.AMH everyBODY Manager, Colin Loughran added: “This is a very practical model and one that could be used as a model of best practice throughout Northern Ireland.“There is a signicant shortfall in support services for people experiencing eating disorder and their families, prior to patients being seen by clinicians.“This new service will fill that gap giving people access to specially trained staff who will provide the vital support to help people in their recovery.”\"  \"  Happiest places in Northern Ireland revealed  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8667856.1539430479!/image/image.jpg","title":"too often the dedication of those working on frontline services goes unnoticed","story":"The unsung heroes of frontline service provision in communities across Northern Ireland have been celebrated at a gala event in Armagh.Councils throughout the province were represented as the nine award category winners of the  Local Government Awards were announced.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well. It’s also great to see representatives from the Irish language community here today.“This council, earlier on this year under a dferent Mayor, launcheda five-year language strategy and we are now seeing the practical out-workings of that strategy including the appointment of the Irish Language Officer.“On behalf of myself and the other councils who have benefited from this scheme we thank Foras Na Gaeilge for this initiative.”Ms Wylie added: “Languages are something to be celebrated. Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers. Today we acknowledge the Irish language community here, in this city and across the north.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"festival frolics to cheer us up","story":"THE announcement by Teesie May on the eve of the Tory conference that there’s to be a Festival of GB and OWC in  has, not surprisingly, split the Pravince down the middle. On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"johnnies havent missed the boat insists mcnulty","story":"ST JOHN’S and Cushendall lock horns again this Sunday at Ballycastle two weeks on from their thrilling drawn semi-final in Dunloy.Cushendall battled back from being five points down in the closing stages to take the lead following a late free from Neil McManus. Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"roisins relief as decision to deny pip is overturned","story":"THE delighted father of West Belfast woman Roisin McWilliams has spoken of his relief after his daughter’s PIP knockback was overturned.Last month the Andersonstown News spoke with Tom McWilliams in his Twinbrook home as he told us the heartbreaking story of his -year-old daughter’s courageous battle with stage  Hodgkin#s lymphoma and how the mother of one was refused PIP on the grounds that she could cook for herself, administer her own medication and plan a journey.An emotional Tom said yesterday: “It was such a relief to us as a family to find out that Roisin’s PIP decision had been overturned and she would also be awarded money owed, this has taken a lot of pressure off her and we can now focus on the future and getting her well again.”Last week Roisin also got more news she was waiting for – funding for her new immune therapy treatment has been granted and she underwent her first session in recent days.Tom said: “I have no doubt that the media pressure surrounding Roisin’s case has helped and I want to thank each and every single person who has taken the time to wish us well and support us. We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leaked emails show arlene foster preparing for nodeal brexit reports","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

We had a series of meetings arranged with representatives of the EU as well as the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. .pushIt was in that meeting with Michel Barnier and his team that we received a very clear outline of the type of post-Brexit arrangement the EU envisioned for Northern Ireland.The deal on offer was certainly unique but as the first State to leave the EU club, any deal will be unique. The EU spin on this offer suggested that Northern Ireland would have the best of both worlds ­— ie we would have full access to the EU single market and full access to the UK single market. That was a lie. We would not.Under the EU’s plan, Great Britain-based businesses would have a barrier when they would seek to trade with Northern Ireland. Such a barrier cuts right to the heart of what is at stake here. The United Kingdom is one nation. There should not be international-style borders within it.I am a unionist. I became involved in politics to build a better Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Back in June , when we agreed a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party, central to it was helping Northern Ireland financially but also the entire United Kingdom. I want every part of the United Kingdom to prosper.I would not tolerate a trade barrier between England and Wales any more than I would tolerate one between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The dangers to the Union and our single market were clearly demonstrated by how quickly the SNP demanded the same for Scotland as was offered to Northern Ireland.  Countries like the United Kingdom have some regional iations but what is held in common is what is fundamental to make their national markets work. We may pay lower rates here than council tax in England. Dferent states in the USA would be the same. However, what is made in each part can be sold within those countries without extra barriers.Indeed, unionists who voted Remain have contacted me to express their vehement opposition to any deal which would limit Northern Ireland’s access to the United Kingdom single market.However, it would be wrong to think that the DUP are the only people in Parliament who see the EU’s proposal as unacceptable. ‘No sea border’ has support across the House of Commons.  I believe that the Prime Minister is in her own beliefs a committed unionist. However, she should learn from her previous female predecessor, Margaret Thatcher. Despite her unionist convictions, others persuaded Thatcher to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement. She later deeply regretted the choice she had made. However, we do not want nor need the regrets of another Prime Minister. We want the right choices made. We want her to stand by her principles and instincts rather than accepting a dodgy deal foisted on her by others.  I fully appreciate the risks of a ‘no deal’ but the dangers of a bad deal are worse. If true to her principles Mrs May would not and should not choose the path to effectively cut Northern Ireland adrt.  The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’. This is no game.  Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.  Over time the gap between UK regulations and EU regulations would only grow. With double red tape for businesses, such an arrangement would add costs for businesses and consumers.This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules made in a place where we have no say.  The coming days, weeks and months will be critical. The decisions taken will shape the type of Northern Ireland that our grandchildren will live in.The DUP will have teams in London, Brussels and Belfast meeting key influencers to ensure our position is fully understood and upheld.On Monday, I will travel to Dublin for a range of meetings. We want a deal which respects Northern Ireland’s constitutional position but one that also works for our nearest neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.  Yesterday when we met our MPs and MLAs collectively, people were united behind our plan and united in standing firm not just for Northern Ireland but for the Union. I reminded people that the stand we are taking is not about the party, this is about the Union and the shape of the United Kingdom for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"ashers photographers booked for gay cake case refuse to hand over images","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

However there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to the backstop.\"A senior UK source suggested Brussels had sought to promote the idea a deal had been reached before the meeting so it would \"look like we are the ones being intransigent\".But with Mrs May under increasing pressure from Tory Eurosceptics and her DUP parliamentary allies, the Government also has a reason to appear to be taking a tough line.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis has urged a Cabinet revolt against the Prime Ministers approach to the talks.The issue of the backstop - a mechanism to avoid a hard border - is at the heart of the troubles facing Mrs May as she attempts to secure a deal. The EU version of the backstop, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs Mays counter-proposal is for a \"temporary customs arrangement\" for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers fear this becoming an open-ended position that would prevent free trade deals with countries around the world.Last night DUP MP Jim Shannon echoed party leader Arlene Fostersprediction in a leaked email that a no-deal Brexit was increasingly likely.\"If the EU insist that Northern Ireland is treated dferently from the rest of the UK, then there is only one option - no deal,\" he stated.He said that though it was neither his nor the DUPs preferred outcome, operating under World Trade Organisationrules after a hard Brexit was nothing to be afraid of. That would be preferable to Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by the EU, as would be the case under present EU plans, Mr Shannon said.He also said the Cabinet was concerned about the potential loss of DUP support, which it relies on in the House of Commons for key votes.\"Weve made it very clear to them thatthe Prime Minister goes ahead with any sort of a deal which makes Northern Irelands position within the UK dferent from anywhere , then there will be repercussions,\" he said. \"Were not joking. Were not going to take any watering down of Northern Irelands place in the UK.\"He added that the DUP deal with the Tories was at stake: \"If she lets us down on this, it can only go one way, and it will be a sad day for her.\"Ahead of her meeting with the Prime Minister, Ms McDonald said the DUP had aligned itself with \"the hard right of the Brexiteers at the cost of imposing a hard border in Ireland\".She added: \"The DUP do not represent the majority of people in the North on Brexit, nor our economic interests, and oppose the Good Friday Agreement.\"They cannot be allowed to set the pace for Brexit or political progress in the North.\"Meanwhile, Tory MP Nadine Dorries suggested Mr Davis should be installed as interim leader, claiming that was the only way to secure the kind of free trade deal Brexit demanded by Eurosceptics.But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was hosting eight EU counterparts at his Chevening country retreat, said \"there is no one who is going to be able to negotiate the right deal for Britain better than Theresa May\", adding \"she is battling for Britain\"."},{"url":null,"title":"fracking due to begin at lancashire site","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

High level representations were made by the Trump administration and the Spanish government over Mr Assange, who was given political refugee status by Ecuador in  over US attempts to prosecute him.“The Trump administrations stepped up efforts to prosecute Mr Assange after WikiLeaks published the largest leak in the history of the CIA last year.“The US has announced that it now considers Ecuador a ‘strategic ally’ and helped it secure a billion dollars in previously withheld loans.“For almost seven months, Ecuador has kept Mr Assange in a regime that has been likened to solitary confinement by Human Rights Watch. Ecuador has prevented Mr Assange from receiving visitors other than his lawyers. It installed three sets of signal jammers in the embassy, to prevent Mr Assange from communicating using mobile phones or internet.“The extrajudicial seven-month isolation of Mr Assange has interfered with his fundamental rights and the rights of his family. It has also prevented Mr Assange from working and giving public talks.“Ecuador has also prevented all journalists from speaking to him during this time. Ecuador’s President until last year, Rafael Correa, has denounced Mr Assange’s treatment as ‘torture’ stating ‘the government is basically attacking Julian’s mental health’.“Ecuador has informed Mr Assange that the government intends to continue Moreno’s policy of restricting him from expressing his opinions under threat of expulsion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mission to mercury set for blastoff","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The kingdom says the allegations are “baseless” but has offered no evidence Mr Khashoggi ever left the consulate.Here is a look at what we know about the disappearance.Who is Jamal Khashoggi \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jamal Khashoggi writes for the Washington Post Mr Khashoggi is a long-time Saudi journalist, foreign correspondent, editor and columnist whose work has been controversial in the past in the ultraconservative Sunni kingdom. He went into self-imposed exile in the United States following the ascension of Prince Mohammed, now next in line to succeed his father, the -year-old King Salman.Mr Khashoggi was known for his interviews and travels with Osama bin Laden between  and , including in Afghanistan, where he wrote about the battle against the Soviet occupation. In the early s, he tried to persuade bin Laden to reconcile with the Saudi royal family andhome from his base in Sudan, but the al-Qaida leader refused.Mr Khashoggi maintained ties with Saudi elites and was viewed as a link between the West and the often opaque royal court. As a contributor to the Post, Mr Khashoggi has written extensively about Saudi Arabia, including criticising its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women’s rights activists after the lting of a ban on women driving.What happened to him Mr Khashoggi, whose th birthday was on Saturday, went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul’s th Levent neighbourhood on September  seeking documents so he could be married to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He was told toto the consulate on October  to pick up those documents, Ms Cengiz says.Surveillance footage later aired on Turkish state television shows Mr Khashoggi walking into the consulate at .pm on October . A little less than two hours later, surveillance footage shows several vehicles with diplomatic licence plates move from the consulate to the consul’s home some . miles away.Ms Cengiz, who spent hours waiting for Mr Khashoggi outside while holding his mobile phones, says her fiance never walked out of the consulate to meet her. Surveillance footage shows her pacing around outside at .pm, speaking on her phone. No footage made public so far has shown Mr Khashoggi walking out of the consulate.What is Turkey saying \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman embrace each other in  Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation, say they fear Saudi Arabia killed Mr Khashoggi. They claim they have audio and video recordings of Mr Khashoggi being interrogated, killed and dismembered. However, no such recordings have been released publicly so far.Turkish security officials, rather than holding news conferences, have leaked information through pro-government media. Newspapers published the names and photographs of  Saudi men in the country’s military and security services who are said to have formed an “assassination squad” sent to target Mr Khashoggi. Turkish officials told The Associated Pressone of those men was a post-mortem expert.Turkish media have also released a series of videos, apparently taken from surveillance cameras, showing the alleged Saudi agents arriving on private jets the day Mr Khashoggi disappeared, checking into and out of hotels near the consulate, and then flying out that night.A Turkish newspaper also claimed that Mr Khashoggi’s Apple Watch recorded audio of his slaying and transmitted it to his iPhone outside the consulate and to his iCloud account. However, the newspaper did not explain how the alleged recording was transmitted and included a claim that Mr Khashoggi’s assailants used his finger to unlock it when such watches do not have fingerprint ID scanners.Turkish officials have not responded to questions from the AP about Mr Khashoggi’s Apple Watch. Analysts have suggested Turkey may be trying to protect its intelligence-gathering methods by leaking information this way.What is Saudi Arabia saying It is amazing how the #Saudi narrative has changed. They are not even trying to prove that they are innocent! This is not a priority for them as it seems! Instead, they resorted to threats to face any possible actions  measures against them in #Khashoggi’s case. pic ZVZusyMbd— Dr. Ali BakeerOctober , Saudi Arabia has offered no explanation for how the writer could have left the consulate and disappeared into Istanbul as his fiancee stood outside waiting for him.Early on Saturday, Saudi interior minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud said: “What has been circulating in terms of supposed orders to kill him are outright lies and baseless allegations against the kingdom’s government.”Meanwhile, Saudi media has tried to blame the crisis on Qatar, which the kingdom and three other Arab nations now boycott as part of a bitter political dispute, without offering proof of that country’s involvement. The Qatar-funded satellite network Al-Jazeera has extensively focused on Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance over the last week.A Saudi-owned satellite news channel, meanwhile, has begun referring to the alleged -man team as “tourists”, without providing evidence to support the claim.What is the US saying \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Trump has threatened Saudi Arabia with ‘severe punishment’ President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment”authorities determine Saudi Arabia was behind Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance. However, he has also said he wants to maintain the arms deals he struck with the kingdom on a trip to Riyadh. Meanwhile, American politicians are threatening to sanction inidual Saudi officialsevidence links them to the writer’s disappearance.What happens next A Saudi team has arrived in Turkey to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance. Meanwhile, Turkey has said it will search the Saudi Consulate for evidence, but that has yet to happen. Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia had not yet co-operated with Turkey on the search for Mr Khashoggi.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy. He said it will also be a pleasure for the local authorityrsquos leisure staff to move to a modern building.The senior council official said everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially, deserve credit for the part they played..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down High pupils make waves at RYA  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos sailors took to the water at the weekend with over  others to battle it out at the RYA Northern Ireland Youth Championships and Schools Cup at Cultra.The sailors from the Downpatrick school battled hard in tough conditions, with a special mention to going to Adam Fermor, sailing in the Laser Standard fleet, who made a clean sweep, with five first place podium finished from five races.Evie Mclaughlin also performed impressively, finishing as third lady overall, in the Laser Radial Fleet.

Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take. Each Round Table has received tickets on which you can guess the mileage on the car when the journey ends.Fty pence is the price per guess and the winner will receive pound. In this way, the Round Table hope to raise in excess of pound, for their selected charity. The drivers will be collecting the ticket stubs from each Round Table as they visits the towns.The drive began on Tuesday at  noon and with a bit of luck and safe driving the boys should be at their last port of call in Wexford on Friday. The winning ticket will be announced at lunch on Sunday.DOWNPATRICK mdash Window-smashing, ransacking vandals left their trademark on yet another school last week when they broke into St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School in Downpatrick.The St Dillonrsquos Avenue school was badly vandalised with the tuck shop destroyed, windows and door  smashed and ious types of equipment wrecked.The latest incident happened last Wednesday night and came less than a week after police had been allied to see the extent of the damage caused by vandals at the nearby St Maryrsquos Secondary School on the Ardglass Road.On that occasion pictures and statues were knocked off walls and broken and several other items, including doors, were badly damaged. Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Theresa May Former Brexit secretary David Davis said the plan was “completely unacceptable” and urged Cabinet ministers to “exert their collective authority”.Meanwhile Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster is reported to have said that a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome after talks with senior figures including Michel Barnier in Brussels.Her party is opposed to any customs arrangement which would result in Northern Ireland being “annexed” or impose extra checks on goods travelling to or from Great Britain.With continued speculation that Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers could resignMrs May presses ahead with the plan, David Davis said: “This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times.”Writing in the Sunday Times he said: “It is time for the Cabinet to exert their collective authority. This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.”The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a orce deal with Brussels, with wrangling continuing over the nature of a “backstop” to keep the frontier opena wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it.The European Union’s version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels’ rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers are suspicious this could turn into a permanent situation, restricting the freedom to strike trade deals around the world.The Sunday Times said at least nine ministers want Mrs May to change course when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.Speculation about possible resignations has centred on Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey, but the newspaper also indicated that Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson could quit because special arrangements for Northern Ireland could fuel the case for Scottish independence.Mrs May’s own position also appeared in jeopardy, with as many as  letters demanding a vote of no confidence reportedly submitted to the Conservative  Committee - just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot.Video: Couple who won gay cake fight urge Christians to take stand Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Northern Irish situation is politically problematic for Mrs May because her minority administration depends on the votes of the  DUP MPs.A leaked email reported in the Observer indicated Mrs Foster was ready to block a Brexit deal.According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, seen by the newspaper, Mrs Foster gave her views during a dinner with the leader of Conservative MEPs, Ashley Fox.The leaked email said Mrs Foster described the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier as “dficult and hostile” and indicated “the DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one”.Writing in the Belfaston Saturday, Mrs Foster said she appreciated the risks of a no-deal Brexit but “the dangers of a bad deal are worse”.She added: “The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’.“This is no game.“Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.”A further demonstration of Tory resistance to Mrs May’s plans came from MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who wrote in the Sundaythat “the idea of remaining in the customs union - even itis called a ‘temporary customs arrangement’ - after the end of the transition period, in to the s, means simply delaying Brexit and causing the . million people who voted for it to lose faith in our democracy”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, warned that when it came to the backstop proposal “temporary means eternal”.In a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond,  Tory MPs challenged him to release the full details of the cross-Whitehall Brexit analysis which forecast GDP growth would be . percentage points lower over  yearsthere was a “no-deal” exit on World Trade Organisation rules.Former minister Steve Baker said: “After several rounds of Project Fear, the reputation of government economic analysis is rock bottom. It’s therefore time to reveal Government’s full working out for close scrutiny in the public interest.try catch     .               ..

Earlier this year the charity unveiled a revamped programme of activities and badges, bringing everything up to date to create a unique and extensive choice of activities which reflects the ersity of girls and modern le in the st century.“We want to give more girls and young women the chance to join Rainbows, Brownies, Guides or Rangers, but for this to happen we need more people to volunteer,” said chief commissioner Brenda Herron.“No matter what skills, interests or experience you have we can find a role for you, and you can give whatever time you’re able to, all you need is enthusiasm and a willingness to laugh and have fun.”For information about how to get involved log on to www.girlguidingulster.org.ukLast month, Girlguiding came under fire after it decided to allow transgender members and leaders.The youth organisation rejected criticism that its policy could put girls at risk..

Paul Charles will be in Belfast later this month to launch his new book  A Day In The Le Of Louis Bloom His real education began when he took on the multiple role of manager, lyricist, roadie, sound-engineer and agent for the Belfast band Fruupp. Although Fruupp split up after four albums, by that point Paul had met Paul Fenn and they became firm friends and partners in the Asgard Agency where – over the last  years – Paul has been agent for a wide range of music acts including Crosby, Stills  Nash, Ray Davies, Lonnie Donegan, Christy Moore, Don McLean, Elvis Costello, John Lee Hooker, Rory Gallagher, Robert Plant, Tom Waits, Van Morrison, The Waterboys and The Undertones. He has also programmed the acoustic stage at Glastonbury Festival for the last  years.So how on earth did this same man become a writer of crime fiction He said: “I’ve loved crime stories and mysteries since I was a kid. It was my second love after music.“In , inspired by Colin Dexter’s Inspector Morse books, I attempted my first detective mystery.”I Love The Sound of Breaking Glass was published the following year. Nine further critically acclaimed DI Christy Kennedy titles followed including ’s A Pleasure To Do Death with You.He said: “You try to come up with a perfect crime and then work back two or three steps and throw some flaws into it so that a detective and his team can solve it.“There’s the famous instance where Arthur Conan Doyle – one of the great detective writers – was asked by the London Met to solve a real le murder and he was totally out of his depth.“When it’s real le and real victims, you don’t control the vertical and horizontal. Le controls all that.”Sammy Wilson: No-deal Brexit probably inevitable Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Now , Paul has been living away from Northern Ireland for  years but he says he has never really left: “I get home quite a bit. My dad still lives in Magherafelt. “Our extended family live in the village and the villages nearby.“I don’t think we ever leave, do we  “There’s a lot of stuff I grew up with that I have sorted into stories, sometimes subconsciously. “People I knew in Northern Ireland give my ideas for characters.“My le in London also features in a lot of the books, especially the Christy Kennedy books – that detective is like myself, from Northern Ireland and like myself, based in Camden Town.”He added: “I remember when I first came over to London in  it took a day to come over here with the ferry and trains and hanging around.“Now you can go door-to-door from Camden Town to Magherafelt in something like three-and-a- half hours. It’s so easy now.”His latest book – A Day In The Le Of Louis Bloom – is the second in the series of McCusker Mysteries set in modern-day Belfast.The book takes retired police office Brendy McCusker to locations including Botanic Gardens, Friar’s Bush Graveyard and the halls of learning at Queen’s University where he and DI Lily O’Carroll encounter enough scandal and deceit to rival even the most venal of governments.The first of the books in the McCusker mysteries crime series is a nod to one of Paul’s clients, Van Morrison. It is called Down On Cyprus Avenue, a street made famous on the singer’s  album Astral Weeks.Author and agent Paul, who has been married to Catherine for  years, continued: “My dream is to have one of my books turned into a television drama. “That’s how I got into Inspector Morse. “I was on tour and watched a few videos of Morse and then discovered the books that way.“It’s an important way for an author to be discovered, through TV.”Of his le as an agent, he said: “All the people I’ve worked with have been good as gold, and I really enjoyed working with them and it was nothing but fun.“It’s just great to be allowed to work so close with these talented people who have made this great music.”Askedhe considered the likes of Steve Earle and Tom Waits as friends, he said: “I’ve worked with Tom since the late s, early s. “You get to know the artists really well, you talk to them about business, and about other stuff as well.“Are they friends  You’d like to say so but you’re maybe being a bit presumptuous.”Paul has also written several non-fiction books drawing on his experience in the music business including Playing Live, How to Succeed in The Music Business and The Best Beatles Book Ever.He will be back home in Northern Ireland later this month to host a book launch event for A Day In The Le Of Louis Bloom at No Alibis Book shop in Botanic Avenue in Belfast on October  at .pm.try catch     .               ..

Angela and John with some of the trophies Angela Jeffers, , a technology and design technician at Hazelwood Integrated College, and her husband John, , operations trainer at Belfast International Airport, started as casual dancers but in the past few years have stepped up to competition level.This summer they were the sole representatives from NI to take part in the Dance Promoters Association’s showpiece in Bournemouth where they were crowned Closed UK Champions in the Over  Beginners category. They also picked up third place in the Over s Novice bracket.Angela, who is originally from Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester, said: “We’re both kept very busy with our jobs but we’ve our weekends free to devote to dancing. We fly over to Liverpool on a Friday night for a lesson for two hours, have a competition on the Sunday and then fly home on Monday morning and go straight back into work.”Along with her husband John who comes from Crumlin, they have picked up an impressive haul of trophies with the prizes they received at the Bournemouth Summer Festival taking pride of place.   Angela and John Jeffers in action “We were up against so many good dancers,” said Angela. “We were astounded to finish with a first and a third place.”She added: “We started dancing lessons just after we got married, so that’s about  years ago, but the competitions we’ve been doing for less than three years.“It never even occurred to us to take lessons before we got married for the first dance. We got married in a very small castle hotel near Edinburgh. We didn’t have a disco anyway, we had a magician instead.”Askedthe dance competitions the pair took part in looked in any way like Strictly Come Dancing, Angela said: “I always worry that all people see of dancing is Strictly. That’s more like show dancing.    Angela and John Jeffers “Competition dancing is not like Strictly whatsover. Our routines are based on trying to get the footwork correct, the timing, the posture.“People think they’re going to see us throwing each other around over our heads. What we do is proper dancing.“For example, to go through the steps of the foxtrot is not dficult, it’s making it look like a foxtrot that is the skill. If someone is dancing and you’re watching them through a window, would you know what dance they are doing  Most times it just looks like they’re walking around the room.”Sammy Wilson: No-deal Brexit probably inevitable Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She added: “In Strictly when you see the smoke on the floor, they’re hiding their feet. The amount of time they spend out of hold, floating about wasting time, that wouldn’t happen in a proper competition.   John and Angela dressed for their appearance in Lost City of Z “I think people who watch Strictly will end up having an unrealistic expectation about dancing. They think you can learn to dance in a week. If we all had a professional training us for  hours a day maybe we could.“It takes a lot longer when you’re only doing one lesson a week which is closer to the norm because of time and money. We go three times a week, maybe spend about five or six hours practising, but that’s because we’re in competitions.”Detailing how they began dancing, Angela said: “It was something that I always wanted to do. We saw this advertisement in a shop in Randalstown for Bob Lindsay’s social dancing class.“My husband started as a reluctant dancer, he really only did it for me. Although he does enjoy it a lot more now.”The pair moved on to Clarke’s Dance Studios in Belfast before getting tuition from Paul Taylor, a professional dancer from Liverpool.Angela said: “I remember being a bag of nerves before our first competition in England. But as we stepped up our lessons our technique, footwork and timing improved. As we did more competitions we started getting a few firsts.“Sadly there aren’t really any competitions in Northern Ireland so mostly we go to England or down to Ireland.“You don’t really do it for the prizes, it’s for personal achievement. We’re all in it together. You get quite friendly with the people you’re dancing against. It can be emotionally draining.”More than being just a hobby that fills their weekends, the couple’s dancing has proved important for John’s health.Angela said: “John had le saving heart surgery seven years ago. He had an aortic aneurism and calcied aortic valve.“He had both replaced in a seven hour operation, at the Royal and was back dancing – gently – after four weeks. “He used the dancing to help rebuild his strength and fitness.” On October , Angela and John will be reunited with their first dance teacher Bob Lindsay for a demonstration in Ballyclare Town Hall.Through their dancing the couple ended up in the feature film ‘Lost City of Z’ in a ballroom scene.John has also appeared on television in an episode of Countryfile looking at the hare population at Belfast International Airport where he works.try catch     .               ..

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall in  being shown the oldest copy of the Belfast News Letter from October , , by John Killen, librarian at the Linen Hall library in Belfast, duringa special viewing of some of the gems in the librarys collection in the Governors room. Picture by Brian Little The paper itself reached its th birthday in September last year. But the first  months of the paper are lost, and the oldest surviving paper is in fact from October  , which is equivalent to October  in the modern calendar.It is the earliest edition in an intact nine-month batch of News Letters from  and  that are held at the Linen Hall Library in central Belfast.In the above picture, you can see the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall being shown the earliest News Letter on a visit to the library in .If Prince Charles becomes king, he will be the th monarch on whom the News Letter has reported since  .Over those same  years, the News Letter has reported on  prime ministers.The latest is Theresa May. The earliest papers from  and  have reports on Robert Walpole, who was Britain’s first premier, and also on Downing Street, which even then was the PM’s base.Sadly the - batch of News Letters are among the only surviving papers between  and the early s. Out of the first , or so News Letters from those first years, around , are lost.That sample of surviving copies, including the October   edition, give a fascinating glimpse into le in the north of Irelandin the early to mid s.The early owners and readers of the News Letter could not have known that the missing editions would become so important because there were many emerging newspapers at the time in Europe and north America, and few of them lasted more than a few years.There is a surviving edition of the News Letter dated March  which is wrongly thought to be the oldest copy, but this is due to confusion over the old Julian calendar, in which the new year began at the end of March. In fact, the March  edition is actually March  in the modern Gregorian calendar. The Julian calendar, which was replaced in , went from December   to January   . This is so hard for modern readers to grasp that the News Letter itself got confused as early as  when, on its centenary, it wrongly reproduced the March  edition as the oldest surviving paper, instead of the even older October  edition.

Then I made an eagle on number  after I topped it off the tee.\"I stuck my second to about  feet and holed the putt.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It began opening retail locations in  and expanded swtly in suburban malls from the s to s.Ruth Parrington, of the Chicago Public Library, studies early Sears Roebuck catalogues But the onset of discounters like Walmart created challenges for Sears that have only grown and it faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowersquos and Home Depot.The operator of Sears and Kmart stores began to incur massive losses, joining a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated in the last few years.A Sears department store in Brooklyn, New York Some like Payless ShoeSource have had success emerging from reorganisation in bankruptcy court but plenty of others have not, including Toys R Us and Bon-Ton Stores, both of which collapsed after a Chapter  filing.ldquoThis is a company that in the s stood like a colossus over the American retail landscape, said Craig Johnson, of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. ldquoHopefully, a smaller new Sears will be healthier.Given its sheer size, Searsrsquo bankruptcy filing will have wide ripple effects on everything from already ailing landlords to its tens of thousands of workers.The filing, ahead of the crucial Christmas shopping season, comes after rescue efforts engineered by chief executive and chairman Eddie Lampert have kept it outside the bankruptcy court mdash until now. Mr Lampert, the largest shareholder, has been loaning out his own money for years and has put together deals to prop up the company, which in turn has benefited his own ESL hedge fund.The bankruptcy filing comes just before the crucial Christmas shopping period Last year, Sears sold its famous Craftsman brand to Stanley Black  Decker following its earlier moves to spin off pieces of its Sears Hometown and Outlet ision and Landsrsquo End.In recent weeks, Mr Lampert has been pushing for a debt restructuring and offering to buy some of Searsrsquo key assets like Kenmore through his hedge fund as a  million US dollar debt repayment falls due on Monday. Mr Lampert personally owns % of the companyrsquos shares. His hedge fund has an .% stake, according to FactSet.ldquoIt is all well and good to undertake financial engineering, but the company is in the business of retailing and without a clear retail plan, the firm simply has no reason to exist, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a recent analyst note.Edward Lampert, left, personally owns % of Sears shares Searsrsquo stock has fallen from about  US dollars over the past year to below the minimum  US dollar level that Nasdaq stocks are required to trade in order to remain on the stock index. In April , shares were trading at around  US dollars. The company, which once had , workers, has seen its workforce shrink to fewer than , people as of earlier this year.The company has racked up . billion US dollars in losses, excluding one-time events, since its last annual profit in , according to Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC. It has had  years of straight annual drops in revenue. In its last fiscal year, it generated . billion US dollars in sales, down from more than  billion US dollars in .As of May, it had fewer than  stores, down from about , at the end of last year. The number of stores peaked in  at ,, including its Sears Canada ision that was later spun off.A Sears store schedule for closure in Overland Park, Kansas In a March  government filing, Sears said there was ldquosubstantial doubt that it would be able to keep its doors open mdash but insisted its turnaround efforts would mitigate that risk.But its losses continued into this year. In the fiscal second quarter ended August , net losses in the quarter swelled to  million US dollars compared with a loss of  million US dollars in the same quarter a year ago.Such financial woes contrast with the promise that Mr Lampert made when he combined Sears and Kmart in , two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. Back then, it operated , stores in total.Mr Lampert pledged toSears to greatness by leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with a loyalty program.

He went into self-imposed exile in the United States following the ascension of Prince Mohammed, now next in line to succeed his father, the -year-old King Salman.Mr Khashoggi was known for his interviews and travels with Osama bin Laden between  and , including in Afghanistan, where he wrote about the battle against the Soviet occupation. In the early s, he tried to persuade bin Laden to reconcile with the Saudi royal family andhome from his base in Sudan, but the al-Qaida leader refused.Mr Khashoggi maintained ties with Saudi elites and was viewed as a link between the West and the often opaque royal court. As a contributor to the Post, Mr Khashoggi has written extensively about Saudi Arabia, including criticising its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of womenrsquos rights activists after the lting of a ban on women driving.What happened to him Mr Khashoggi, whose th birthday was on Saturday, went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbulrsquos th Levent neighbourhood on September  seeking documents so he could be married to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He was told toto the consulate on October  to pick up those documents, Ms Cengiz says.Surveillance footage later aired on Turkish state television shows Mr Khashoggi walking into the consulate at .pm on October . A little less than two hours later, surveillance footage shows several vehicles with diplomatic licence plates move from the consulate to the consulrsquos home some . miles away.Ms Cengiz, who spent hours waiting for Mr Khashoggi outside while holding his mobile phones, says her fiance never walked out of the consulate to meet her. Surveillance footage shows her pacing around outside at .pm, speaking on her phone. No footage made public so far has shown Mr Khashoggi walking out of the consulate.What is Turkey saying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, and Saudi Arabiarsquos King Salman embrace each other in  Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation, say they fear Saudi Arabia killed Mr Khashoggi. They claim they have audio and video recordings of Mr Khashoggi being interrogated, killed and dismembered. However, no such recordings have been released publicly so far.Turkish security officials, rather than holding news conferences, have leaked information through pro-government media. Newspapers published the names and photographs of  Saudi men in the countryrsquos military and security services who are said to have formed an ldquoassassination squad sent to target Mr Khashoggi. Turkish officials told The Associated Pressone of those men was a post-mortem expert.Turkish media have also released a series of videos, apparently taken from surveillance cameras, showing the alleged Saudi agents arriving on private jets the day Mr Khashoggi disappeared, checking into and out of hotels near the consulate, and then flying out that night.A Turkish newspaper also claimed that Mr Khashoggirsquos Apple Watch recorded audio of his slaying and transmitted it to his iPhone outside the consulate and to his iCloud account. However, the newspaper did not explain how the alleged recording was transmitted and included a claim that Mr Khashoggirsquos assailants used his finger to unlock it when such watches do not have fingerprint ID scanners.Turkish officials have not responded to questions from the AP about Mr Khashoggirsquos Apple Watch. Analysts have suggested Turkey may be trying to protect its intelligence-gathering methods by leaking information this way.What is Saudi Arabia saying It is amazing how the #Saudi narrative has changed. They are not even trying to prove that they are innocent! This is not a priority for them as it seems! Instead, they resorted to threats to face any possible actions  measures against them in #Khashoggirsquos case. pic ZVZusyMbdmdash Dr. Ali BakeerOctober , Saudi Arabia has offered no explanation for how the writer could have left the consulate and disappeared into Istanbul as his fiancee stood outside waiting for him.Early on Saturday, Saudi interior minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud said: ldquoWhat has been circulating in terms of supposed orders to kill him are outright lies and baseless allegations against the kingdomrsquos government.Meanwhile, Saudi media has tried to blame the crisis on Qatar, which the kingdom and three other Arab nations now boycott as part of a bitter political dispute, without offering proof of that countryrsquos involvement. The Qatar-funded satellite network Al-Jazeera has extensively focused on Mr Khashoggirsquos disappearance over the last week.A Saudi-owned satellite news channel, meanwhile, has begun referring to the alleged -man team as ldquotourists, without providing evidence to support the claim.What is the US saying Donald Trump has threatened Saudi Arabia with lsquosevere punishmentrsquo President Donald Trump has threatened ldquosevere punishmentauthorities determine Saudi Arabia was behind Mr Khashoggirsquos disappearance. However, he has also said he wants to maintain the arms deals he struck with the kingdom on a trip to Riyadh. Meanwhile, American politicians are threatening to sanction inidual Saudi officialsevidence links them to the writerrsquos disappearance.What happens next A Saudi team has arrived in Turkey to investigate Mr Khashoggirsquos disappearance. Meanwhile, Turkey has said it will search the Saudi Consulate for evidence, but that has yet to happen. Turkeyrsquos foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia had not yet co-operated with Turkey on the search for Mr Khashoggi. That could force Turkeyrsquos hand in leaking more information about the case to pressure the kingdom to co-operate..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: QA: What us known about Saudi journalist us disappearance  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
