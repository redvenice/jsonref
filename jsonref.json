The Rectory served a small village which had very prominent links with the mining industry. Although any urban exploration involves a level of danger, FreakyD believes that his hobby allows people to see into a world that would otherwise be forgotten.          The mansion still has most of its lights on in the unsettling images. Urban explorer FreakyD said he \u0027can\u0027t imagine\u0027 why the house was left and why there has been \u0027no effort\u0027 to maintain it         The dark kitchen has the blind pulled down and cooking utensils still hanging on the walls.

The photographer did not give away the home\u0027s exact location or name for fear of vandals or thieves breaking in and further defacing the property FreakyD said: \u0027Urban explorers often get a bad name being mistaken as vandals or thieves. We have no interest in damaging the properties we explore or taking things, we actually care more than most that they remain untouched for others to enjoy. \u0027Most buildings I explore are large industrial buildings where the business has closed the doors for good or gutted homes which have been left to rot but this building is different. \u0027There are little personal items that haven\u0027t been taken, clothes still lie folded in the drawers, even the electric toothbrush had battery life left. I can\u0027t imagine why this house was left and why there has been no effort to maintain it, mothballed and forgotten about. It\u0027s bizarre.          A white, wooden cradle filled with stuff animals has also been left behind in the nursery, indicating a child lived in the house         Clothes are still neatly folded away and hanging from the furniture in one of the rooms, with a sink and mirror in the background alongside a small mirror on top of the chest of drawers         A stately piano is one of the musical instruments left behind, with a drum kit also sitting in another corner of the house          An ornate wooden staircase and a black and white tiled floor are situated towards the entrance of the property. A red bicycle can be seen left leaning against the side of the staircase\u0027Despite a small area of water damage the house is in very good condition, especially to say it has been left for over a decade.\u0027The one downside to buildings that still have power is you need to be wary of exposed live cables.\u0027Although the house itself was peculiar - with an ornate spiral staircase circling into the games room and an array of musical instruments dotted around - it was the familial touches which left the daredevil photographer \u0027emotional\u0027.         A portrait of two children was found in one of the bedrooms of the household on top of a grey-stoned mantelpiece          The bathroom of the 150-years-old mansion features a long tub and blue tiles, with a deckchair propped up in the corner next to the shower. A bath mat can be seen still hanging over the tub         The dining room of the old rectory has wooden polished chairs and a table, with a chandelier hanging from above and a dated radiator below one of the closed curtains          A candle has drooped over time as the heat of the conservatory takes its toll. Most of the side windows are boarded up with 5 chairs surrounding a table in the corner of the room\u0027The house is filled with letters between family members and friends, photographs from celebrations, crafts made by the children and countless other items that make it a very typical family home,\u0027 said FreakyD.\u0027Notes left out from small children in scrawled handwriting with heartfelt love letters to their parents really give this abandoned home character - and a lot of emotion.\u0027With so much left untouched for so long this house is like exploring a time capsule, one that only a handful of people have seen. \u0027I really hope this property remains hidden from people who wish to disrupt this amazing building and hopefully will be content in seeing my pictures.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Man triumphs parking firm judge rules instructions clear mud","story":"Share this article \u0027I was surprised to receive a letter informing me that I had not paid for parking and that I was therefore being fined.\u0027It was only at this point I re-checked the text that I sent and discovered that I had received a text saying that the method of paying by SMS was no longer supported.\u0027Mr Smith appealed his fine to POPLA - an independent appeals service for parking charge notices - which was rejected.He then decided to take the matter to court after feeling that he had done nothing wrong by \u0027faithfully following the instructions on the board\u0027.

As well as taking away about half of the surviving sculptures before eventually selling them to the British Museum, Elgin also employed specialist craftsmen to create detailed plaster casts of many of the artworks that he left behind on the great Athens monument.Now analysis of those casts has revealed details that have since been lost on the original sculptures, casting fresh light on an almost forgotten technique that could reveal further insights about some of the most celebrated monuments in classical art.Research by Dr Emma Payne, a specialist in classics and archaeological conservation based at King’s College London, shows that in 1802, when Elgin’s men made their casts, the sculptures of the west frieze of the Parthenon were in markedly better condition than they are today.“Elgin’s casts could be important records of the state of the sculptures in the very early 19th century before modern pollution would hasten their deterioration,” said Payne.By comparing the casts with present-day 3D scans of the west frieze – which was removed from the monument in 1993 and is now in the Acropolis Museum in Athens – she revealed features that are now lost, including the faces of some of the sculptures, and chisel marks showing they had intentionally been chipped away by Victorian-era vandals.While it has long been known that the casts preserve some lost sections, Payne’s research showed that the copies were more accurate than expected, with most of the casts deviating by barely a millimetre from the originals.As a result, she showed that Elgin’s copies are the best-preserved 3D record of what Dr Ian Jenkins, a senior curator of ancient Greece at the British Museum, says came to be considered “the most beautiful manmade sculptures on earth”.Payne also analysed a second set of casts, commissioned by the British Museum in 1872. She was able to show that more damage was caused in the intervening seven decades than in the 120 years that followed, meaning that a century of traffic pollution did less harm than Victorian vandals. Her research is published in Antiquity magazine.Payne’s scans also confirm that in some cases, the people who created the Elgin moulds had attempted to recreate pieces that were already missing by that time, resulting in some crude additions.Payne told the  she had been surprised by how accurate her computer-aided analysis had shown the copies to be. “Certainly the results very much emphasise the skill of the casters, and it shows that there is still information that we can potentially learn about the Parthenon sculptures from these 19th-century studies that haven’t really been looked at in detail.”Notably, she said, other large excavations of the period, including at Delphi and Olympia, had also made moulds of the artworks they uncovered – which could potentially yield their own secrets.Payne said: “This work helps us to understand the important role that such casts can still play as 3D time capsules, but we need to study them very closely to understand exactly what it is they preserve.”Asked if a fresh recognition of the casts’ value might lessen the controversy around Elgin’s involvement, Jenkins said: “In my view Lord Elgin rescued the sculptures, and I do think that this recording of the west frieze is all part of his great sense of reverence for the ancient past.”Unusually, he said, the names of the cast-makers had been recorded where those of other skilled craftsmen were not “because they were seen to be producing something which was essentially art”.The temple had already suffered significant damage by the time Elgin made his casts. It was damaged by fire in the 3rd century AD, and some sculptures were deliberately damaged when it was converted to a church in the early Christian era, around AD600. By the 15th century it had been converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, and in 1687 was being used as a gunpowder store when an explosion caused significant damage to parts of the building.

It was a revelation. The “I” had such an immediate “reality effect”, she writes: no longer was it so necessary to build, painstakingly, the “reality” of a third-person world – the “I” cut through at once, and the reader was away.In autofiction, this power is only intensified. How much is factual (for that has its own deep power also, as every memoirist knows)? How much is not? How unsettled does the reader therefore feel? And how much is in the gift of the author – that is, who gets to call it fiction at all? The Indian poet, novelist and activist Meena Kandasamy, bruised by the reception of When I Hit You, an autofictional account of her own short and abusive first marriage, argues that it all depends on who you are and especially where you are from. “To a Western audience,” she writes in the margins of her new novella, Exquisite Cadavers:writers like me are interesting because– we are from a place where horrible things happen, or, – horrible things have happened to us, or, – a combination of the above.No one discusses process with us.No one discusses our work in the framework of the novel as an evolving form.No one treats us as writers, only as diarists who survived.One could of course argue that for someone as au fait with Foucault and Derrida and Barthes as Kandasamy, expecting the author to control the reception of the text is a somewhat naive proposition. And the judges of the Women’s prize for fiction clearly had no doubt about what When I Hit You was intended to be, shortlisting it for last year’s award. One knows, at the same time, that what she says is all too often entirely true.Exquisite Cadavers (“cadavre exquis” was the surrealists’ art version of the parlour game Consequences) is a response to the response – a novella about a young couple in London, Maya and Karim, whose lives are not the same as Kandasamy’s own. In the margins a commentary discusses where the ideas come from and how fictional they are, mixed with anecdotes from her life (look! how different!) with her Belgian partner and one, then two, children. Karim is from Tunisia, Maya mixed-race British. “I make her relatable to the British readers,” writes Kandasamy, in an amusing aside. “I steal a little of every Englishwoman I see to build the composite. Amy Sarah Claire Naomi Gill Lucy Allison and god yes Kate.”Kandasamy, who now lives in London, packs a lot into 100 pages – not just two stories, but opinions about immigration, sexual violence, #MeToo, film criticism, selfhood, the inidual’s relationship to history, the damage handed down by families. She does it with acute insight, and often wry humour. She is especially good on difficult relationships, and the gathering trap of liberal identity politics. Karim is a film studies undergraduate in London on a scholarship, looking for a subject for his first film. Everything he suggests, however, is rejected. But a “project embracing and interrogating his identity is encouraged ... As motivation. As art statement. As part of their ‘institutional commitment and mission to include a whole host of erse voices’ ... What he also hears are their unsaid words. You are here, here in London, on a scholarship, we have covered your tuition, we expect you to listen to us.”Karim retreats into sarcasm. “Sadly, sarcasm, mocking and lampooning are all preserves of equals – someone like him will always be taken only at face value.” The supposed freedom to make art reveals itself to be as “utterly transactional” as the 20 hours a week he spends working in a Turkish restaurant. And Maya, able to pass as white, British born and bred but now in a mixed marriage with an Arab man, is introduced to a world of micro-aggressions. There are insinuations that he might have multiple wives, might have been tortured clumsy checks that she has not suddenly discovered religion. This spiky, argumentative book is the novel as protest, as polemic, as dark comedy, as game.Occasionally Kandasamy’s tendencies towards assertion and aphorism (“for Maya, disappearance is detonation”) and her references to art-house movies tip into pretentiousness those allergic to French critical theory will find phrases like “another time bricolage of an earlier holiday” or the sweeping assumptions of one of her epigrams (“the purpose of avant-garde writing for a writer of colour is to prove you are human”) profoundly irritating. Sometimes she is heavy- handed. But her project is also short, sharp and effective, not least in the way events (pregnancy, friends of Kandasamy’s arrested at home, Karim’s worries about his own relations in Tunisia) begin to echo each other. Separation of “truth” from “fiction” is, it seems, really the artificial construct. The world rushes in, exploding her attempt at English domesticity. Which is either another argument for the necessary evolution of the novel – or a rediscovery of how it has always worked.• Exquisite Cadavers is published by Atlantic (£5.99).

For half a century after she died in 1817, her books were little known or read. A few discriminating admirers such as George Henry Lewes and Lord Macaulay kept the flame of her reputation burning, but most novelists and novel readers were oblivious to her. Then, in 1869, her nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh published a memoir about her and the public got interested. Her novels started being republished and widely read. She has never looked back.Janine Barchas’s The Lost Books of Jane Austen puts us right. Her book about books is a beautifully illustrated exploration, indeed compendium, of the popular editions of Austen’s novels that have appeared over the last two centuries. This includes those decades when Austen was supposedly lost from sight. The first chapter is a “vignette” on a copy of Sense and Sensibility, published in 1851 for George Routledge’s Railway Library (books suitable for reading on the train). It cost one shilling and was bought for the 13-year-old Gertrude Wallace, the youngest daughter of a Plymouth naval officer. It is the first of many examples of cheap and popular editions of Austen’s work that kept it alive for ordinary readers and that literary scholars have largely ignored.After Austen’s death, the copyrights to her novels were bought by the publisher Richard Bentley, who issued them in his Standard Novels series in 1833, in single volumes at six shillings each – much cheaper than the triple decker editions selling for a guinea and a half, but still out of reach of all but the affluent. He cut his prices in the 1840s, but already there were alternatives. By the late 1840s, there were what we would call paperback editions of her novels cheaply available and aimed at train travellers. Pioneering publishers such as Simms \u0026amp M’Intyre produced Austen novels for a shilling a shot, and then for sixpence each in their Books for the People series. (They paid no attention to the fact that Bentley officially still owned the copyright to some of these.)“Cheap books make authors canonical,” proclaims Barchas’s first sentence. Thousands of mid-century readers consumed “yellowback” versions of Austen’s novels, so-called because of the yellow paper stuck to the back of them on which advertisements were printed. The sheer proliferation of cheaply produced editions of Austen’s fiction has been invisible because very few of these books have survived. Paradoxically, the expensive first editions of Austen’s novels are now easier to find than the mass-market editions of the Victorian age. Barchas has clearly relished her detective work (and apparently amassed quite a collection herself). She not only describes them, she shows us what they looked like.Photographs are essential to this book. There in front of you is the 1851 Parlour Library reprint of Mansfield Park, with its red design and lettering on a startling acid green cover, in waxed paper boards. It retailed at WH Smith at British railway stations for two shillings. The willingness of publishers to spice up Austen’s novels is caught in the 1870 Chapman \u0026amp Hall edition of Pride and Prejudice, whose cover depicts Lydia Bennet flirting with officers at their camp in Brighton, or the 1887 sixpenny Sense and Sensibility, featuring Colonel Brandon and Willoughby pointing their duelling pistols at each other (neither scene was actually included in either novel).Tracking down these endlessly repackaged reprints, Barchas is in terra incognita. Scholarly bibliographers have minutely recorded the various respectable editions of Austen’s fiction, but most of these cheap popular products, never having made it on to the library shelf, remained unknown to bibliographers. These are volumes that scarcely feature in the catalogues of the great research libraries of Britain and North America. The existing record is, as Barchas characteristically says, “gobsmackingly incomplete”. Her style is sometimes informal, but her attention to print history is painstaking.She explains the importance of stereotyping processes, whereby printers could mould and then cast in metal the expensively assembled type of a new edition. The resultant stereotyple plates could be used over and over again. Routledge would go on to use his same stereotype plates to produce seven more editions of Sense and Sensibility over the next three decades. (Barchas gives us a photograph of all of them in their very various liveries.) Austen stereotype plates would be sold on from one publisher to another, the resultant type becoming more and more faded as one printing succeeded another.There clearly was a new enthusiasm for the novels after 1870. Barchas shows us the flurry of colourfully jacketed Austen volumes that began appearing, some evidently intended for the juvenile reader. In America, where publishers treated Austen’s texts with greater literary respect, the market for her work was much quieter in the mid-19th century, but appears to have taken off in the 1870s. Her novels became available for a dime or 15 cents each. In Britain, the sixpenny novel became standard. Soon Austen was being serialised.In the 1890s, radical publishers produced a library of “famous books” for working-class readers at a penny per volume, which included Sense and Sensibility. At the same time Pride and Prejudice was being boiled down by two thirds for William Stead’s Penny Prose Classic series for young readers. In the 1890s the soap manufacturers Lever Brothers published their own editions of the two novels as prizes for teenage consumers who sent in the largest number of soap wrappers. Barchas dedicates a whole chapter to her researches into the Sunlight Library, calculating that the company gave away some 1.5m books over the course of seven years (though perhaps more by Sir Walter Scott than Jane Austen).Another chapter chronicles the surprising religious and morally improving uses of her fiction. In the 1840s her novels were included in a multi-volume library of nonconformist tomes aimed at right-minded female readers. Often, they were given as prizes in Sunday schools (despite the creepy vicars she depicts). In the 1890s, editions of Austen were commissioned by a Christian temperance society for distribution to labourers in the West Midlands: Mansfield Park was presented as an alternative to another visit to the pub.Barchas follows popular editions of Austen well into the 20th century, looking at how publishers began to take images from Hollywood films such as the 1940 MGM Pride and Prejudice to lend excitement to new editions.A final chapter charts “The Turn to ‘Chick Lit’”, with Barchas arguing that it was only really in the 1960s that “gendered marketing strategies” created the false sense that Austen was a women’s novelist. Among the dizzying variety of 1960s paperback covers that she displays – from austerely antiquarian to lividly psychedelic – are examples of “pinked” editions, deploying the colour wherever possible as a “consumer signal to women”. Sales seem to have risen even further.Barchas enjoys quoting such writers as Mark Twain and Henry James, as they huff and puff about Austen’s mere popularity. The lesson of this delicious book is that she was even more popular for even longer with an even greater variety of readers than we ever thought. When you look at all the uses to which she was put, you think of Frank Kermode’s definition of a literary classic as a work that “sub-sists in change, by being patient of interpretation”. Austen’s novels have long been very patient.• John Mullan’s What Matters in Jane Austen? is published by Bloomsbury.

The investment index providers MSCI, S\u0026ampP Dow Jones and FTSE Russell, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange, have all said they will fast-track the inclusion of Aramco shares into their indices, which would mean that investors around the world, including pension funds, would automatically be forced to buy shares.Even if the company reaches a $2tn valuation, the float still represented scaled-back ambitions from the Saudi state after international investors baulked at the high valuation of the business. The backlash prompted the Saudi state to retreat on plans for a higher-profile listing on an international stock exchange, with New York leading a pack of hopeful contenders. In June 2018, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority weakened the required oversight for sovereign-backed companies listing on the London Stock Exchange – a move condemned by corporate governance experts.Aramco could still raise more money as it seeks a broader base of international institutional investors than the mainly Saudi investors who backed the initial float.

Buyers can pop down to the nearby Sheesh restaurant, a celebrity haunt in a building owned by fellow Chigwell resident Lord Alan Sugar, where footballers Harry Kane and Rio Ferdinand have been pictured hanging out.But despite gaining 150,000 views on Rightmove, the property has yet to find a buyer after 11 months on the market.Footballers appear to have trouble selling their luxury pads, because the third most-viewed property on Rightmove is a triple-level penthouse occupying the 44th to 46th floors of Manchester’s Beetham Tower. It is understood to be owned by former Manchester United and England defender Phil Neville, now manager of the England women’s team. First listed on Rightmove in June 2017 for £4m, it has failed to find a buyer and the asking price is now £3.5m.It has four bedrooms, a chandelier cascading down a spiral staircase and views of Old Trafford. The agents describe it as “aspirational living at its best”. The current owner can at least comfort themselves with the rental income, believed to be around £15,000 a month.Fourth in the league of most-viewed properties on Rightmove was yet another home in top-flight football territory. Prestbury, a picturesque village in Cheshire’s “golden triangle” is home to Wayne Rooney and Peter Crouch.Overdale is a seven-bed mansion with spa, indoor pool and gym priced at £3.95m, but it too has hung around on the market for a long time, after first being listed in November last year. James Webster of agents Gascoigne Halman said: “We’ve had a couple of near-misses with buyers. It has been an interesting market this year what with Brexit and the election and there is considerable holding of breath until the outcome on Thursday night. I think after that we’ll see a lot more activity.”Castles were the other properties most sought after by professional snoopers. Glenborrodale Castle, a five-storey of the Scots baronial architectural style, was the second-most viewed home on Rightmove. But with a price tag of £3.75m the buyer will get rather more than a footballer’s palace apart from the 16 bedrooms there are 132 acres, a gate lodge, coach house and three islands.The fifth most-viewed property on Rightmove during the year was perhaps its most traditionally appealing: a 400-year-old grade I-listed country manor in Christow, about 12 miles southwest of Exeter. Priced at £3.95m, Canonteign Manor was taken for King Charles I and his troops during the English civil war and was built on land given to the canons of St Mary du Val in Normandy around 1125."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19cd3be66b8a0c07655d458323355606a0979848/0_349_5698_3420/master/5698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa2cd04e522ae966df56d344c3d3f560","title":"mark starrs family thought he was thriving in a new city the truth was far darker","story":"Mark Starr 1965-2019 It took five weeks for the news to reach the Starrs: rather than being stable and happy, Mark had died sleeping rough in a Glasgow park. Why?by  Daniel Lavelle and  Simon HattenstoneOn 8 July, Police Scotland issued a statement: “Police are appealing for the assistance of the public in tracing relatives of 53-year-old Mark David James Starr, who was found dead within the Glasgow Green area of Glasgow on 28 June 2019.” Starr was homeless and had been sleeping rough in Glasgow’s oldest city park. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances, although the cause of death has not yet been determined.Three weeks later, another appeal was issued. “Officers believe Mr Starr may have relatives in the Kent area, but have been unable to track down any family members despite a previous appeal on 8 July.” It seemed like one of those horribly familiar stories – homeless man dies alone, with no one to miss or mourn him.“We didn’t find out till five weeks after Mark died. And then it was on social media,” says Mark’s mother, Sue. She looks at her daughter, Karen. “One of your friends saw it on Facebook didn’t she, and texted you.”“Yeah, she said: ‘This isn’t your Mark, is it?’” Karen says. “I couldn’t believe it.”“I still can’t believe it,” Sue says. “Well, you don’t ever imagine one of your children is going to end up in that situation, do you? He always told me he was doing fine in Glasgow.” Silence.They sound numb. Both are still in shock. It’s September, barely a month since they heard the news, and only a week since Mark Starr’s funeral in his home town, Ashford, Kent. Sue and Karen tell us about the service. Four old friends carried the coffin, and they played some of Mark’s favourite songs: Bitter Sweet Symphony, Like a Rolling Stone, He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother – all of them painfully apt.We meet at a cafe in Ashford town centre. Karen is shy and withdrawn Sue is open and talkative, and even in her grief she wheezes with laughter at some of the things Humpy got up to. Humpy is Mark. That’s the nickname his older brother, Tony, gave him when he was a little boy because he always got the hump. Somebody would take his ball or he would go fishing and catch nothing, and Mark would strop off for a couple of hours. But he always came back. He loved his nickname, and had it tattooed on his arm. It was his only tattoo.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and  Cities\u0026nbspwill look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths.\u0026nbspAs the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all.\u0026nbspIt is time to stop just passing by.Mark was born two months premature, weighing just three and a half pounds. “We didn’t think he’d survive,” Sue says. “I was going to call him Jason. I just liked the name. But the priest came to see me and said: ‘I think we better get the baby christened straight away,’ and I couldn’t think straight. He suggested Mark, ’cos he was a saint.” After a month, Mark began to thrive and Sue was allowed to leave hospital.The Starrs were a close family, but nobody was closer to Mark than Tony. He isn’t here today because he has taken his brother’s death so badly. “We used to get the school bus together and the driver called us the Three Musketeers because we always looked out for each other,” Karen says. Sue and Karen have brought photos with them. There are pictures of Mark eating a toffee apple in Hastings, holding a tiny monkey, camping with friends in Wales.“I don’t think they washed all week!” Sue says. Her laughter sets off her hacking smoker’s cough. Like all the family, Sue sounds cockney even though she was born and bred in Kent. She tells us about the rosettes Mark won for showjumping. “There was a time we thought he would be a jockey. He was really good.” But as with so much, he lost interest.There are so many stories about Mark – most of them involving the outdoors, and things going hopelessly wrong. There was the time he went camping and the tent blew away in the middle of the night because they hadn’t secured it properly the school trip when he got lost the visit to Luton to watch George Best when he and Tony got on the corrugated iron roof and fell through it. He was a happy, fearless boy, they say.Mark left school at 15 without qualifications. “He was never going to be a scholar,” Sue says. “His reports always said: ‘Could do well, but lacks concentration.’” He got a job assisting a gamekeeper. The problem was he didn’t bother turning up to work. “He did come clean in the end,” Sue says. “He was just hanging out with his mates. You always thought he was listening to you, but he wasn’t really.” Nothing appeared to worry him, she says. And that’s what stopped her worrying about him – for a while.A few weeks later we meet Tony Starr with Sue in Ashford. With red hair stretching down his back and a lived-in face, Tony looks like an ageing rock star. His early memories of Mark are idyllic – fishing with their father every Sunday, floating down the river on homemade rafts, crabbing on the beach, listening to nightingales in the woods, hanging off cliffs to collect birds’ eggs. “Not a care in the world, mate,” he says. “We’d take a few jam sandwiches when we were thirsty we drank river water! Humpy was a good fisher. You made your own entertainment in them days. We weren’t stuck in front of a screen eight hours a day.”But the more he talks about his brother, the more complex the character that emerges. As a young boy, Mark had terrible nightmares. “He’d wake up in the night, proper screaming. We never understood why. I’d just pick a slipper up and throw it at him. ‘Shut up Humpy.’ One night we were hanging out in the back garden, in a tent, camping out, and Humpy was screaming in his sleep. The neighbour jumped over the fence. He thought we were being attacked. Humpy always sucked his thumb. Even into his late 30s, he sucked his thumb.”Rather than being carefree, it sounds more like Mark simply didn’t care, so he would steal packets of Chewits as a kid and not worry about being chased by the shop owner, and years later would drive without having passed his test. Sue talks about the time his grandmother needed a lift and Mark called for her in a little white van. When Mark’s grandmother complained that it was cold and asked him if the windows were open, he replied there were no windows. “I said to Mark: ‘You’ve not got a licence, you can’t keep doing this.’ ‘I don’t need a licence,’ he said.” That was always his attitude – he didn’t need the paperwork, didn’t need to follow rules, didn’t need money or a job – he would get by.And, for a time, he did. His family still say he never seemed unhappy. He had plenty of friends, and was popular with women. In his early 20s, he moved in with his girlfriend, Rebecca. “She was stunning,” Tony says. “Honest to God, she’d make Page 3 girls look ordinary. I thought: you’re punching above your weight there, Hump. But Rebecca only had eyes for him. They’d been friends as kids – she was a bit of a wild child.”Tony says Mark and Rebecca started to take cannabis, and progressed from there. Before long they were injecting heroin. Then one day Mark woke up, and Rebecca was dead in bed next to him. She was 24. “He never recovered from that,” Tony says. “A part of him never came back.”Even then his parents didn’t know he was addicted to heroin. Mark returned to the family home, and one day his father found a syringe in his bedroom. Mark told his father, a concrete finisher on building sites, that it wasn’t his syringe. “And his dad said: ‘Well, it’s not mine or Mum’s or Tony’s or Karen’s. Don’t treat me like a fool, it’s got to be yours,’” Sue says. Tony remembers how distraught their father was that day. “We had a few chickens back then. I went down to see my dad and he was in tears, looking at the chickens. Blank face. I’d never seen my dad like that. He was just so sad about it.”After Rebecca’s death, Mark lost three more people he loved: his aunt Elsie, who used to take the Starr children on holiday every summer and was known in the family for making the best chips in Kent his best friend, Martin (another drug addict) and his father, who died suddenly 20 years ago, when he was still working on building sites. “Humpy took it bad. Dad adored all of us, but Humpy was his favourite. And Humpy loved Dad.”As time went on, Mark became less and less functional. He served a few short prison sentences for shoplifting and then three years of a five-year term for attempting to import 60g of heroin in his pants. Even when he was in jail he told his family that he was doing just fine. Sue reads a letter Mark sent from Elmley prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, soon after arriving there. “The food’s OK. Send my love to everyone. Tell Aunt Elsie I’m OK and not to worry … see you both in a couple of months. Lots of love, Mark.”He came out of prison, tried to beat his addiction and failed. But still his family insist he didn’t seem to have a care in the world. He had a council flat in Ashford and would pop round every day to Karen’s for a cooked breakfast. Tony says he never forgot a birthday, would always trim his grandmother’s hedge, and that he was a wonderful uncle to Tony’s son, Jude. “Humpy thought the world of my boy. He’d come round for Sunday dinner and straight afterwards he’d say: ‘Come on, Jude, let’s go out and have a game of football.’ When Eminem came over he got a photo signed by him. God knows where he got it from.”Despite the acts of generosity, Mark’s life became more and more chaotic. He would disappear for long periods of time without telling the family. Tony went round to his flat one day and was shocked to see drug paraphernalia everywhere. “It was like needle city. I went mad. I said: ‘You silly bugger. Leave that stuff alone, it’s a one-way ticket to misery.’ But it was like talking to a brick wall. I said: ‘Humpy mate, they are going to get rid of you’, and they did. They evicted him.”It was about eight years ago that Mark was evicted from his flat in Ashford. There were times he stayed with Tony and Sue, and times he lived on the streets. Tony says some local people treated Mark with contempt. “Kids used to throw water over him. He got no help in Ashford. He was frowned upon.” He would stay with Tony, but after a few days he would find it claustrophobic. “Then he’d just go. He couldn’t stay in one place.” Over the years Mark became delusional. Neither Tony nor Sue believe he got the support he needed. “There ain’t no mental health these days,” Tony says. “It’s all shot to pieces.”Four years ago, Mark upped and left Ashford. Again, he didn’t give his family warning. “Eventually he phoned me up and I said: ‘Where are you, Mark?’ And he said: ‘I’m in Scotland,’” Sue recalls. “I said: ‘What are you doing up there?’ He said: ‘It’s lovely here, and the people here are lovely.’ He said he was staying in a hostel. I was looking after my mum who had dementia and couldn’t be left, and he phoned up and said: ‘You and nan will have to come up for a holiday when I’ve got my own place. It’s really good up here. I’m happy.’ I said: ‘Thank goodness for that.’” Then he told them he did have his own place. And Sue says she really was convinced he was thriving.However, on his occasional returns to Ashford, Mark seemed to be anything but thriving. His mental health had deteriorated and his delusions had got worse. “One time he said: ‘I’ve got to go, I’m meeting Jay-Z and Beyoncé tonight,’” Tony says. “I said: ‘Have a nice time, Hump.’ Then he’d tell us that Roman Abramovich had lent him his yacht.”Did he say things like this when he lived in Ashford? “Yeah, but it just got worse,” Sue says. “One of the last times he came down, he said: ‘I met Rebecca and Dad up town and they’re coming back.’” She doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry, so she does a bit of both. “That’s when I knew how ill he was. He really believed it.”Occasionally he told Tony the truth. “We’d be up till six or seven in the morning just chatting about old times and chewing the fat, and he’d say: ‘You don’t know what it’s like to go in bins and search for food.’ That really kicked the stomach out of me to think he had to do that.” Sue shakes her head. “He never said anything like that to me. He always made out he was all right up there.” “He weren’t,” Tony tells her gently. “He weren’t, Mum.” Sue says she still doesn’t understand why Mark went to Scotland. Tony tells her Mark said that people like him were better supported in Glasgow than Ashford.As with the rest of Britain, there is a homelessness crisis in Scotland. Shelter Scotland figures show that in 2018-19, 36,465 homeless applications were made and 29,894 households were assessed as homeless by their local authority. In Glasgow, 5,679 homeless applications were made in 2018-19, from a population of 608,000. But Scotland is also making a serious attempt to address its crisis. The country is piloting Housing First in five of its biggest cities, based on models that have been used successfully in places as erse as Finland and New York. Housing First is founded on the principle that people with complex needs are provided with a home and wraparound services at the same time. It is, though, a slow and expensive process. In Glasgow, the hope is that, over five years, 600 people will be taken off the streets or out of emergency accommodation and provided with homes.In March, it was revealed that 139 people had died in Scotland on the streets or in temporary or supported homeless accommodation over the past 18 months. One thing that devastates the Starr family is how long it took them to find out that Mark was dead. Tony says Police Scotland was efficient and supportive. It contacted Kent police immediately to inform them about Mark. And that’s when things went awry. Kent police turned up at the doorstep of Sue’s house, but by then she was living with a friend. The person now living in Sue’s house has since told her that he passed her new address to the police. But the police never got in touch with her. When she heard that Kent police were looking for her, she phoned them, but was told by an officer that he knew nothing about the matter.It is early September, more than two months since Mark died, and Kent police has still not spoken to the family, let alone apologised (though it does a couple of months later). Tony says this has made the grieving process much more painful. He feels he never got the chance to say a proper goodbye to his brother.Tony decides to come to Scotland with us to find out more about Mark’s final months. He hopes it might provide the family with some kind of closure. Sue says she would find it too upsetting, but is glad he is doing it on the family’s behalf. What is she hoping he will find out? “It’s a silly question, really, but was he happy up there?” She smiles. “It’s a strange thing to say isn’t it? Happy on the street. But I know he was happy there sometimes.”It is early morning in mid-October, and we’re on the train to Glasgow. Tony has already cracked open a few cans of heavy-duty lager. It’s hard to know whether it’s dutch courage or habit. Sometimes, he says, he will only drink a couple of cans in a day sometimes many more. He likes to smoke cannabis, too, but has never used class A drugs. He’s terrified of them – he saw what they did to Mark.Tony has also had a tough life. He has anxiety and depression, and says that, in his 20s, there was a year after a relationship ended when he could barely set foot outside his house. When he and Jude’s mother split up, he looked after Jude. In December 2003, two people turned up at his house demanding that he hand over Jude. Tony refused and was stabbed in the face. One of the assailants was subsequently jailed, and the incident left Tony with post-traumatic stress disorder. Soon after the attack, Tony won custody of Jude.Tony has not worked since then, and has struggled financially. There have been times, he says, when it could easily have been him homeless as well as Mark. “I’ve had letters saying: ‘We’re going to evict you.’ It can happen to anybody. It’s really scary. Two years ago, there was a mix-up with the council, I fell briefly behind with rent and they went straight to eviction proceedings.”Tony is feeling emotional. He says he had to make this trip because Mark would have done the same for him. He takes out a photo – the last picture taken of the two brothers. Tony is topless, and they both look a little the worse for wear. “He was a bit bony by then. You know my last memory of Humpy is him walking down the path and me saying: ‘I love you, Hump.’ He said: ‘I love you too, bruv.’ That’s the last words I said to Humpy. I had a sixth sense something was going to happen. I told a few friends, I’m going to get a phone call soon.”He is also thinking about the good times, not all of them from childhood. Six years ago, they saw the Rolling Stones play in Hyde Park – one of the best days of their life, he says. “We were stood in a posh pub in our shorts smoking a joint. I think we got away with it ’cos the Stones were playing. We went to some blinding concerts, but that was the best. Unbelievable. It was the last concert we went to. I’ll cherish that memory.” He opens another can. “There’s only one Humpy Starr, believe me. He was unique.”“Excuse me, love, you don’t recognise this fella, do you? It’s my brother.” Tony kneels down to talk to a young homeless woman on the street – a girl really. He shows her the picture. She doesn’t recognise him, but they chat for a couple of minutes. It’s almost midnight, and the street homeless people of Glasgow are bedding down for the night.Tony approaches a skinny man with a red pointy beard. Barry, who is in his late 30s, has been living on the streets for the best part of 20 years and looks like a cross between Billy Connolly and Worzel Gummidge. He doesn’t recognise Mark either, but he forms an instant bond with Tony. Barry says he would rather be on the streets than in the hostels because they are loud, dirty and violent.“How d’you cope? Blimey, you must be battle hardened by now, Barry?” Tony says.“Aye, I’m used to it. There have been a lot of deaths when it’s been cold, but cold doesnae bother me. Some of the public can be all right, but you’ve also got the ones that walk past and spit on you. You need to find somewhere safe at night in case a crowd come and set on you.”Semra says she has been turned away from a hostel for being abusive, but insists she was just bantering with a friend. She has been homeless for some time, but this is her first night on the street and she’s terrified. “They told me to sleep under a camera so I can’t be murdered. What fucking chance have I got?” She pauses, and looks at Tony. “You can see the sadness in your eyes. You can see the hurt. I’m so sorry for your loss.”Tony says her account of Mark rings true. “He didn’t really drink, but he did like his crack.” Most important to Tony, she said Mark was a good man.Soon after getting to Glasgow, we receive a call from the council press office – just guidance, they say. They tell us that Mark did have accommodation, but he was evicted twice – once after uncapped needles were found in his temporary home, and another time for being aggressive. Tony is upset when I tell him the news. He says he has never known Mark to be aggressive. Yes, he says, he would fight back if provoked, but that’s all.Shelter Scotland call us to say it has information that may be of interest to Tony. We rush over to its offices, where we meet the community hub manager Davy MacIver and the senior development worker Stephen Wishart. They make for a good double act – MacIver small and quietly spoken, Wishart big and combative.“For about a week he was sleeping rough and couldn’t get accommodated again,” says MacIver. “That’s when we come in. We would have assisted him with his legal requirement to accommodation.” On another occasion he was gatekept after giving up a temporary furnished flat when he had started hearing voices. Again, the council failed to provide him with emergency accommodation. Shelter says the last time it saw him, it helped him find accommodation, but it didn’t see him in the final month of his life, and doesn’t know how he ended up back on the streets. He was due to meet Shelter on 28 June for help with his personal independence payment claim. He didn’t turn up. That was the day he died, a day before his 54th birthday.Tony asks whether there is any reference to violent behaviour in the case notes. “No,” Wishart says. “He doesn’t seem to be one of the clients who have been asked to leave places for violence … it was never an issue. But I’ve seen people asked to leave these places for cheek rather than aggression, and we’re told it’s aggression. But then when you look at it, it’s someone telling them to F-off.”Tony tells them his mother wants to know whether Mark was happy in Glasgow. He knows the answer, but he still feels he has to ask on behalf of Sue. “I wouldn’t say he seemed unhappy, if that makes sense,” Wishart says. “Given his circumstances, he was engaging. We get a lot of angry people in here, but Mark wasn’t like that. He was never up, never down, always even. Mark was a nice guy.”Tony mentions that the council said he had been evicted for leaving uncapped needles on the floor of his flat. MacIver gives a despairing look. “Private accommodation providers aren’t set up to cope with the situations they’re having to deal with,” he says. “Their response is to have a zero-tolerance policy because that’s the only thing they can effectively manage. You need properly resourced providers with specialist provision. Private landlords are not going to do the trick.”They talk about the Housing First model being rolled out gradually across Glasgow, and say it’s wonderful – in principle. “Housing First is actually designed for people like Mark,” Wishart says. “Yet I sit in meetings and hear about people being too complex for Housing First. So what are they not too complex for? Or are they just never to have a house? Is that it? OK, well, let’s just throw the towel in because we’re in the wrong game. Anyway, don’t get me started.” But it’s too late. Wishart is fuming.What would victory look like in the battle against the council? “That’s easy to answer,” says Wishart. “That people like Mark who approach the local authority and make a homeless application and ask for emergency accommodation, they get it.”Tony is impressed by their passion – and the fact that Mark may be one of the test cases in the legal action. As we leave, he makes an impromptu speech in praise of Scotland. “I’m thankful for what you’ve told me. Humpy was born in England, but died a son of Scotland. He loved the Glasgow people. I’ve only been here a day, but I can see why. I’ll be coming back.”Wherever we go we bump into Barry on the streets, and he’s brimming with ideas about where Tony might find people who knew Mark. He suggests we visit the City Mission day centre. At night its building serves as emergency accommodation for homeless people. The main hall is packed with people chatting at tables, eating and playing pool. Margaret, a middle-aged woman with a kindly, prematurely aged face, smiles affectionately when she sees the photo of Mark. “He was lonesome,” she tells Tony. “Me and my pals would sit next to him and talk to him. I talked to him all the time. He’d say: ‘I’m down.’ It was sad.”Tony asks her if Mark was a drinker? Tony seems to use the answer as a gauge of reliability. “No,” Margaret says. “He just liked the one can.” He asks what it’s like to sleep rough. “It’s horrible. People sleep under bridges by Central station and people spit on them and kick them. A guy got stabbed last week on the other side of the bridge. It’s dangerous, aye. Dangerous.” Tony hugs her as we leave.The next day we meet SNP councillor Mhairi Hunter, Glasgow city council’s convener for health and social care. Hunter says she is proud of the homelessness work the council is doing with Housing First, and explains how radical it is because homeless people no longer need to prove themselves “tenancy ready” when they move in. However admirable the model, it means little to Tony, and he can no longer hold back.“We found out by law my brother should have been housed,” Tony says.“Three times he had to find somewhere to live and he was on the streets.”“I can’t talk in detail about your brother’s case, but there can be circumstances where people get asked to leave accommodation,” Hunter says.“See, I’m thinking if my brother had been put somewhere and he got help that he needed, he could still be alive today.”Hunter nods silently. Would she accept that the council has failed to fulfil its duty to homeless people? “A hundred per cent,” she says. “Those figures are provided by us, and it’s part of our system to record every instance where somebody isn’t accommodated.”She says the SNP-run council is making progress, but Shelter hasn’t given it enough time. “You can’t just shut the system down and reboot it. It has to happen incrementally. That’s why it’s a five-year plan. I would absolutely not say our homelessness systems are fit for purpose because I know they are not.”Hunter has a point. The very fact that it is unlawful to deny homeless people temporary accommodation in Scotland is a sign of how seriously it takes the issue. As is the fact that Glasgow city council itself provides figures for the number of times it has failed to accommodate people in temporary accommodation – the stick with which Shelter can beat it. But the bottom line, as Hunter acknowledges, is that the council has acted unlawfully.It’s a beautiful, cold, fresh day in Glasgow Green. Tony has brought Mark’s ashes to scatter over the Nelson Monument, close to where he died. He opens the box, throws them into the air and breaks down. “There you go, Hump. There you go, bruv.” He kisses the memorial and crosses himself. “I love you, Hump. God bless you, brother. Will you keep a space for me up there, Humpy? Take care, bruv. I love you.”After gathering himself, he phones Sue to tell her he has scattered Mark’s ashes. She asks him what he has found out about Mark’s time in Glasgow. He tells her that he has met people who knew him, and that they have only good things to say about him. He doesn’t say anything about whether Mark was happy here in his final days.When he puts the phone down, he tells us he has been shocked to discover the life Mark was leading. “I didn’t think he’d go downhill like this. I really didn’t. He had a hard life up here – on his own, a lot of the time wandering around the streets, freezing cold, soaking wet, nothing to eat, treated like a dog, really.” And yet, despite everything, he says something positive has come out of this. “Walking in Humpy’s footsteps, I felt closer to him,” he says. “Being with the homeless in Glasgow has been very humbling. After hearing some of the stories. I can’t believe the kindness they show.”What was he expecting? “To be honest, I was expecting: ‘No, I don’t want to talk to you, F-off.’ No one said that. I just think of Humpy being on a park bench somewhere, freezing cold, and Margaret turning up with her friends and trying to cheer him up. Some of the public think they’re the dregs of society, yet they’ve got more kindness, more resilience, more compassion ... they’re unbelievable.”As we head back south, Tony opens a can of lager. There is so much to tell the family, he says. No, he can’t say Mark died happy or comfortably, but he thinks he can tell them something equally important. He talks about the Shelter case, and sitting in Mhairi Hunter’s office telling her that Mark might still be here if the council had done right by him. And he talks about the possibility of Mark being cited as evidence that the council did not fulfil its statutory duty to the homeless people of Glasgow. He knows his family will continue to grieve for Mark, but maybe, just maybe, something good will come of his death. “If Humpy stops more people dying on the streets by holding the council to account,” he says, “then his death won’t have been in vain.”Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.orgIf you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.

Bringing her new show to Sydney, the bushfire smoke presents another problemHanna Cormick is allergic to the industrialised world. When the Helsinki-born, Canberra-raised actor, acrobat and contortionist is exposed to everyday items such as plastic, pesticides, cigarettes, perfumes, some food odour or even the ink in a book, she is prone to not only hives, throat swelling and anaphylaxis but “very violent” seizures too.The seizures “look like I’ve lost consciousness and my whole body is jerking and moving about on its own”, she explains. They are caused by mast cell activation syndrome, an immunological condition that forces Cormick to spend most of her life in a sealed “safe” room in her mother’s Canberra house.Anyone entering Cormick’s room has to go through a decontamination process, because many products derived from fossil fuels pose her serious danger. She lives in the house with her actor partner, and her safe room contains a positive-pressure air system, multiple air filtration devices and, by necessity, little furniture.Soon, Cormick will briefly journey to Sydney festival to perform her short, text-based show The Mermaid: both the story of her life and a metaphor for the poisoning of the planet. “I had been treating my body as something I could exploit, without expecting to meet its needs,” she recalls via Skype from her sealed room.“I realised, like the world’s reliance on fossil fuels and their impact on the planet, I had been treating my body with the same hyper-capitalist mindset.”Cormick’s performances will be staged at the Coal Loader in Waverton, a former coal plant turned into a sustainability centre on the waterfront. The Sydney trip has required detailed advanced planning. She had planned to stay in an eco-construction on a remote Blue Mountains property – the clean air of bush living is easier on her mast cells – but the bushfires sweeping through the state have presented high risks.“It’s obviously in all our minds, given the current fires, but we haven’t found a good back-up yet,” she says, when emailed a follow-up question amid the haze this week. “We will probably have to find a less immunologically safe (but more fire-safe) location, and I would need to sleep in protective gear and my respiratory equipment and oxygen – which I’ve been having to do with the smoke pollution right now anyway.“It’s really painful – respirator masks are very painful to wear for long periods – but it’s kept me breathing fine so far.”Performing in public carries severe risks to her safety, too. At the start and end of her first performance of the premiere season of The Mermaid, in Canberra in March 2018, Cormick suffered seizures while sitting on the floor in front of her audience.“It can be really confronting, and I think not just to see these sorts of medical events they don’t always happen in the work, it is random,” she says.“The audience also has to think about the way our own actions might be impacting others.”The Sydney festival shows require audience members to be mindful of what they bring in with them – but the venue’s naturally ventilated, outdoor harbourside location lessens the risk.Until 2015, Cormick had been enjoying a multiskilled acrobatic and acting career in Europe – including an arts residency in the south of France, working with circus in refugee camps on the Turkish-Syrian border, devising and rehearsing shows in Paris and performing with a troupe at the Edinburgh fringe festival.But she had been hiding a growing list of unexplained symptoms – weight and muscle strength loss, fainting and being out of breath – until “the crash” of April that year: allergic reactions to all food, great pain and an inability to walk up a flight of stairs.Forced to return to Australia to rest and seek answers, her doctor raised the possibility Cormick was suffering a form of the debilitating genetic connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This bad news was just the beginning.This syndrome impacts not only joint mobility but, in more severe cases such as Cormick’s, causes serious problems in every organ system: brain, heart, lungs, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, pelvic organs and veins.“Now, my bones are coming out of their sockets many times every day,” says the former contortionist, who was finally diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 2017. The next year Cormick was diagnosed with – among other diseases – mast cell activation syndrome, the cause of her seizures and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a form of orthostatic intolerance which can also cause her body to collapse. Her father has the same “trifecta”, she says, and her mother has mast cell activation syndrome too.These days, when Cormick ventures outside her safe room in her wheelchair – “once a week, once a fortnight, that kind of thing, usually for an hour at a time” – she wears a respirator and relies on an oxygen tank to avoid seizure triggers. It is a “big operation”, requiring multiple helpers, to ensure she is as safe from pollutants as possible.There is no treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but physiotherapy helps prevent deterioration. For postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, Cormick is on regular IV saline infusions and is weighing up getting a pacemaker fitted. Frequent injections of a high-dose drug, omalizumab, have decreased the frequency of Cormick’s seizures, and she has the standard rescue medications for acute episodes: adrenaline, oxygen and albuterol.There are other immunotherapy medications that could help, she says, but they are restricted in Australia. “Sometimes it feels like you fight bureaucracy more than you fight the symptoms.”Part of Cormick’s motivation in creating The Mermaid was to confront her own past attitudes to disability. She says she will be forever grateful to the performer Liz Carr, who drew her attention to the concept of the “social model” of disability, which holds that disability is caused by the way society is organised.“The circus industry, the dance industry are incredibly ableist spaces, and I had developed a damaging mindset that confused my values with what I could do, with my productivity, especially my physical abilities,” Cormick says.“They are industries that foster the idea you can do anything if you try hard enough. Having the antidote of the social model was necessary for me to start unlearning that.”• The Mermaid is at the Coal Loader from 17 to 19 January 2020.

It is only the second bird in history to recover from being extinct in the wild, after the California condor.Other species to have their status updated include the echo parakeet, of which there are now more than 750 in the wild, leading to a reclassification as a “vulnerable” species, having been critically endangered more than a decade ago.The Australian trout cod and pedder galaxias, both freshwater fish, have also showed improvement, the former moving from endangered to vulnerable and the latter from critically endangered to endangered, after many years of conservation efforts.However, the red list data released on Tuesday also showed 73 species declines despite conservation efforts, and the list now numbers 112,432 species around the world, of which more than 30,000 are on the brink of extinction.The IUCN update came as governments from more than 190 nations met in Madrid for two weeks of talks aimed at pushing global action on greenhouse gas emissions. Progress at the talks has been slow, despite public pressure, and campaigners have been frustrated that key issues such as the bioersity crisis have received little official attention.“The tightly woven links between climate and bioersity must be recognised at COP25 and there is good reason for this: the impact that a changing climate will have on the ability of ecosystems to support plant and animal life, and the challenges that bioersity already face in a warming world are both vast,” said Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK.1m\u0026nbspSpecies threatened with extinctionEcosystems are already under unprecedented pressure from human impacts, including habitat loss from encroachment by urbanisation and farming, pollution, hunting, overfishing and invasive species. But the accelerating climate crisis is pushing nature to breaking point around the world, wiping out vital ecosystems, putting unbearable pressure on species and leading some experts to declare a sixth mass extinction.“To avert the worst of these impacts, we have to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C,” said Redmond-King. “There is no time for debate. Only a dramatic increase in the ambition of our collective response can avert the climate crisis we are in.”One of the ironies of the UN climate talks is that protecting natural systems could provide a lifeline for humanity out of the climate crisis – yet it is one that is often neglected at these annual talks. A focus on “nature-based solutions” could make a marked difference to action on the climate, said Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme. “We need to take the lessons we have learned on the climate change journey.”She pointed to deforestation, which threatens species and is accelerating the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Preserving forests is relatively cheap, but is the subject of tense debate at the COP25 talks because some nations want to sell carbon credits from their standing forests, as well as counting them towards their national emissions reduction targets. That argument has yet to be resolved, and may not be before the UN talks end on Friday.Marine bioersity – which is under threat from climate breakdown – was also supposed to be a key focus at these talks, which were billed as the Blue COP when the location was fixed as Santiago in Chile. The move to Madrid, forced by political unrest in Chile, has meant a loss of some of that focus, frustrating oceans campaigners, who have argued that protecting the oceans is vital to their capacity to store carbon and help combat the climate emergency.Oceana, a marine NGO, called attention to the “blue forests” composed of marine algae which are widespread across the planet and which store carbon dioxide and provide a lifeline for the thousands of species that depend on them “Blue forests are one of the main lungs of our oceans, and we should protect them as they deserve,” said Ricardo Aguilar, the senior research director at Oceana in Europe. “Scientific reports tend to focus on terrestrial forests, but marine algae can account for as much as a fifth of the CO2 stored by oceans. It is vital that decision-makers include their protection within international policies against the climate crisis.”Another study released at COP25, published in the journal Global Change Biology, illustrated how preserving mangrove groves can provide a key buffer against the impacts of global heating. Researchers studied the Segara Anakan lagoon in Java, Indonesia, and found it had huge potential for storing carbon, fostering bioersity and protecting against storms.Next year will be a crucial one for action on both the climate emergency and the bioersity crisis. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, where nations will have to come up with vastly improved targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decade to fulfil the pledges of the 2015 Paris agreement.Before those talks take place, in Glasgow next November, the IUCN will hold its four-yearly World Conservation Congress in June and the UN Bioersity Convention will decide on new measures for preserving species at a meeting in Kunming, China, in October.Campaigners hope the sequence of key meetings will lead to a greater focus on nature in the coming year, but stressed that more needed to be done to draw out the interdependency of these issues, rather than allowing them to be seen in isolation.• This article was amended on 11 December 2019 because an earlier version referred to some experts declaring a fifth mass extinction.

And yet there are aspects of the film that seem older still, as if it were some artifact from a culture that’s utterly foreign and incomprehensible. The judgment rendered against Ted Kramer in orce court – and the shockingly odious terms of his child visitation rights – is so unjust that the film could be interpreted as Men’s Rights propaganda.That interpretation would be wrong, for many reasons, but it’s worth noting that legal experts at the time were puzzled by it, too. In fact, in a New York Times survey of four jurists the week the film came out, Felice K Shea, then acting justice of the New York State supreme court, lamented, “It’s too bad that the legal profession was portrayed as 50 years behind the times … In so many ways the court process was portrayed as unfeeling, unrealistic and incomplete.” And so by that math, Kramer vs Kramer seems nearly a century old, ending with a custody judgment and a denouement that are baffling for two loving parents who live in the same city.Yet Kramer vs Kramer remains a film of immense sensitivity and heart, and context helps clear up some confusion about the film’s depiction of parenthood, gender roles and the process of getting a orce, all of which were closely intertwined and in a state of flux. When the film came out, it had only been 10 years since California became the first state to pass a no-fault orce law, in which the dissolution of a marriage does not require evidence of wrongdoing by either party. And New York, where the film takes place, was the last of the 50 states to allow no-fault orce, through a law that wasn’t signed until 2010.Broadly speaking, no-fault allowed for easier and cheaper orces, which both unburdened the legal system and accommodated a higher orce rate. While the law isn’t specifically relevant to Kramer vs Kramer – which has the parties fighting in court at great expense – it does reflect a change in the culture, where women especially were better able to leave unhappy marriages and achieve self-actualization. That didn’t relieve the stigma of a mother leaving a child behind, as Joanna Kramer (Streep) does here, or undercut social biases about women being better caregivers to their children than men, which ultimately harms Ted Kramer (Hoffman) in court. But when the film came out, such matters were up for fierce debate.Viewers are definitely free to assign fault to the characters in Kramer vs Kramer, just as they currently are over Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson’s characters in Marriage Story, which has an equally jaundiced view of the legal process. And at first glance – and maybe every glance, for some – Benton’s film is hugely unbalanced in favor of Ted, a workaholic ad executive who scrambles to look after his son Billy (Justin Henry) when Joanna quietly yet firmly walks out the door. Joanna only appears near the beginning and end of the film, and in the 18 months between when she leaves and when she comes back seeking sole custody of Billy, all we see are scenes of father and son bonding together. In terms of audience sympathy, she never stands a chance.But Benton and Streep do their best with the time that they have. Kramer vs Kramer opens with a devastating scene of Joanna tucking Billy into bed one last time, stroking his hair and telling the boy she loves him. Had the film been about her journey, it might have been something like Francis Ford Coppola’s excellent 1969 road movie The Rain People, in which a housewife leaves her husband for destinations unknown, motivated equally by wanderlust and a feeling of suffocation at home. Joanna is obviously a deeply unhappy woman, forced to cede her ambitions to her career-driven husband and beaten down by motherhood, with all its hassles and loneliness. Streep suggests a combination of vulnerability and resolve, as if Joanna is using the vapors of self-esteem she has left to will a new life for herself.And it’s clear from the start that Ted has been clinging to old-fashioned notions of parenthood, when men were married to the office and fatherhood was more of a ceremonial role. The morning after Joanna leaves, he disastrously improvises a breakfast of French toast and coffee, and loses his temper around his son, not for the last time. The 80s would make comedies like Mr Mom and Three Men and a Baby out of hapless fathers thrown into domestic chaos, but Kramer vs Kramer plays it straight, as the steep learning curve caused by his negligence. If the Kramers’ custody battle came down to hours logged, Ted wouldn’t stand a chance, even counting 18 months his wife was gone completely.For as difficult as Kramer vs Kramer can be to accept as a film about orce – both from a legal standpoint and from our imbalance of sympathies for the Kramer – it’s often exceptionally beautiful as a story about a father learning to have a real relationship with his son. Ted doesn’t know how to set boundaries at first, so Billy tests them in a great scene where he refuses to eat the umpteenth TV dinner and goes straight for the ice cream in the freezer, daring his father to follow through on a threat to punish him. All Ted can do is yell at the kid impotently (“I hate you, you little shit!”), as bad parents do, because their kids have no idea what to expect from them.Once the two find a groove, the film picks up on the ease they start to feel around each other as they settle into a routine and Ted prioritizes his son over the biggest account of his career. Whenever the action shifts outside, the legendary French cinematographer Nestor Almendros, a master of wide-angle lenses and natural light, seems to pump the film full of oxygen, as if they can finally breathe together on their own power. When one of those playground trips ends in an incident where Billy nearly loses an eye, Ted’s response in the emergency room – advocating for his son while staying by his side for every stitch – is not something he’d have been capable of doing before. Squaring up to his responsibilities makes him a better person.The ending of Kramer vs Kramer is a terrible copout, a Hollywood reversal of the gross injustice doled out by the court. By that point in the film, Ted has a better understanding of Joanna than he did at the beginning, because now he knows what her day-to-day life was actually like and he’s come to terms with his own screwed-up priorities. For Joanna to forfeit custody entirely is supposed to redeem her, but it makes her the villain once more, because she’s walking out on her son a second time. Even 40 years ago, parenthood wasn’t a zero-sum game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28bf014795156af1abd2aa93b107930f4e594816/0_22_5597_3359/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c382200e938ab21a401a7c6cb0478c0","title":"yotam ottolenghi christmas chocoflan recipe","story":"This magical Mexican dessert features a layer of flan and a layer of cake, all bathed in a salted caramel sauce, making it perfect for the Christmas tableAnd try this Christmas chocolate chestnut prune cake recipe from Rachel Roddy“So bad, it’s good” couldn’t have a more fitting use than for chocoflan, a Mexican dessert that combines two layers of pure decadence in one cake.There’s a nifty science trick in this recipe, when the cake layer and the flan layer swap positions during the baking. We’ve tested this with different tins without much success, so do make sure you use a 27cm bundt tin that does not have a removable base. I’d recommend making this a day ahead, because it tastes even better when fridge-cold. 160g caramel sauce (thick set), store bought or homemade – I used Waitrose salted caramel dipping sauce1 tbsp whole milkFor the chocolate cake120g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing250g plain flour½ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda70g cocoa powder¼ tsp salt100g dark muscovado sugar125g caster sugar2 large eggs200ml buttermilkFor the flan1 x 400g tin evaporated milk 1 x 397g tin sweetened condensed milk 120g full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature3 large eggs2 tsp vanilla bean paste¼ tsp saltHeat the oven to 170C (160C fan) 350Fgas 4. Liberally grease a 27cm bundt tin with butter, then coat the bottom with half the caramel sauce and put the tin into a larger roasting tin about 40cm x 28cm in size.Now start on the cake batter. Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb, cocoa powder and salt into a medium bowl. Put the butter and both sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed for about two minutes, until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time only until just incorporated, then turn the speed to medium-low. Mix in a third of the flour mixture and half the buttermilk, then repeat before adding the last of the flour. Mix until everything is just incorporated, then transfer to the bundt tin, smoothing out the top with the back of a spoon.For the flan batter, blitz all the ingredients in a blender until smooth – about 15 seconds. Pour the flan batter over the cake batter in the tin, then cover the bundt tin first with a piece of greaseproof paper and then with a piece of foil, wrapping it up tightly. Add enough boiling water to the roasting tin to come about 2cm up the sides of the bundt tin, then transfer to the oven and bake for an hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out almost clean rotate the tin once after 30 minutes, to ensure an even bake. Lift the tin out of its water bath, remove the foil and greaseproof paper, and leave for about an hour, until completely cool.Invert the chocoflan on to a large, round platter – you may need to shake it slightly to release it from the tin – then refrigerate until cold, for at least two hours and, ideally, if time allows, overnight. To serve, thin the remaining 80g caramel with the milk and drizzle all over the flan.• This article was edited on 10 December 2019.

Klopp said the Egypt international’s refusal to lose focus after the misses was a major factor in Liverpool’s highly impressive victory.Liverpool qualified top of their group, with Napoli finishing second, and Klopp cited his players’ respect for the Austrian champions as another impressive hallmark of their performance. He added: “I couldn’t have more respect for what Salzburg are doing. I know how people see it, you think about being best in Austria is OK but some people don’t respect that. You see how good they are, how good they were in the first game, how good they were against Napoli.“We came here as current Champions League winners and I would really love it if my team is so smart that they listen and put a shift in like that. Salzburg were unbelievably strong, especially in the first half, but we were as well and were ready for the fight. We should have scored in the first half and then in the second half, it’s not easy to keep that intensity. We scored the goals and could have scored more, but I have really massive respect for Salzburg.”Jesse Marsch, the Salzburg coach, said his confident team were ultimately undone by Liverpool’s European pedigree. “In the end they showed their quality,” he said. “Salah’s goal was unbelievable. It was like a heavyweight fight. We punched them but then they punched us twice more.”Dejan Lovren was forced off with an injury in the second half but Klopp claimed it was not serious and hopefully a repeat of the minor problem the defender suffered in the win at Bournemouth on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4746cb09c0ab8424fbe25eea171291c9219a7b/0_601_3472_2083/master/3472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e970b7b319f400e1cbb2f08757e007e","title":"empire of sin pc ps4 xbox one nintendo switch","story":"PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo SwitchBrenda Romero’s crime sim is a homage to the glitter and skulduggery of prohibition-era Chicago – a game of revenge, race and relationship managementThe 1920s in the US was a time of scarcity for some, impossible wealth and glory for others. The country’s nationwide alcohol ban gave rise to an explosion in organised crime, much of it concentrated in Chicago, where underground speakeasies flowed with hooch smuggled over the Canadian border. This was the heyday of Dean O’Banion, who ran a vast bootlegging business out of a simple flower shop, and Stephanie St Clair, self-appointed queen of Manhattan’s illegal lottery scene.This is also the sleaze-filled setting for forthcoming strategy game Empire of Sin, the latest project from veteran designer Brenda Romero. Here, you’re cast as one of the competing crimelords tasked with taking over Chicago, street by street and racket by racket. You’re free to use any combination of foul means to come out on top – gunning down the other side’s lieutenants in chesslike combat, betraying allies to the police, selling poisoned alcohol to competitors. Beware, though – every trick in your arsenal can be used against you, and Empire of Sin is a game with a long memory. Every major character, from your big-name rivals to your own underlings, is a distinct, evolving personality with an opinion of the player. Spread enough bad blood around the city, and you may end up digging bullets out of your back at the height of your power.Empire of Sin is a passion project for Romero, Bafta-winning designer of the acclaimed Wizardry series. Its roots go back to her childhood in Ogdensburg, New York, a town just across the river from Canada. Ogdensburg is home to a bar, The Place, that is said to be the oldest continuously operating drinking establishment in the US, even staying open during the Prohibition era. How on earth did they get away with this, the young Brenda wondered? Not wanting to sour her daughter’s view of the police, her mother kept stumm – and unwittingly sparked a lifelong obsession. Romero’s husband and co-developer John (otherwise known as the co-creator of Doom) has a more direct family connection to the premise of Empire of Sin: Elvira Duarte, one of the game’s bosses, is his great-grandmother.Empire of Sin is a rich and surprising simulation, split between a white-boxed city management perspective in which time passes continuously, and the grimy or glitzy distilleries, casinos and brothels where battles are waged. Everything hinges, however, on the production and sale of alcohol, your chief source of income. To safeguard your breweries while expanding your dominion, you’ll need to recruit gangsters from a pool of 60 characters that is shared between player and AI-controlled gangs.The sharing of that recruitment pool is vital: it means that each character in the game can build up a history with different factions, siding with one boss after the other. Each gangster has a backstory and a set of personal objectives, such as murdering a nemesis many of them are also friends, lovers or blood relations. Those dynamics shift over the course of the game, depending on how you treat characters.It’s a truly tortuous network of attachments and grudges that should, by the finale of each game, throw up plenty of nasty surprises. If one of your lieutenants screws up a job, her companions may lose respect for her and refuse to work with her. If somebody’s beau is slain while defending a racket, that character may run rampage – killing somebody you’d rather leave upright, and so giving their own sweetheart reason to hate you. As overlord, you can rule your gang with either velvet glove or iron fist. Opt to messily execute a downed foe, and your capos will come to fear you, while potentially developing sadistic tendencies themselves.One of Empire of Sin’s more intriguing aspects is the line it walks with regard to period prejudices. There’s plenty of discrimination at play in the game’s metropolis, though it isn’t foregrounded. One boss, Frank Regan, is an out-and-out racist – good luck getting him to buddy up with an African American kingpin such as Daniel McKee Jackson. But Brenda Romero is keen that as far as is possible, every player should feel represented by its cast. “The ultimate thing is I want you to be able to see yourself. That was in there from the beginning. I might have a unique perspective, because I got into the industry in 1981, but I couldn’t play a female character until 1987.” This has involved a bit of creative licence – inventing characters such as the conniving socialite Goldie Garneau, and porting over gangsters such as Stephanie St Clair who wielded power in other cities.Romero has already made her name as a designer, but as the game she’s always wanted to make, she feels that Empire of Sin is her greatest test. “I feel like I spent a lot of time circling around the idea – an inordinate amount of time,” she says. “Because nothing really fit.” She notes that Empire of Sin has plenty of precedents in other games, citing the conspiracy-ridden medieval dynasty sim Crusader Kings as a spiritual cousin. “But there isn’t a reference for how all of this stuff comes together. So on the one hand, it’s incredibly exciting to see it all come together for the first time. But it’s also scary, because what if it doesn’t?”• Empire of Sin is released on PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in spring 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc8e6133c5a4c7c3ce24ff4a2a899ddc968a79f6/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99112fb734ab8ecd54a1944870b3af26","title":"soulmates do not exist the surprising rise of wedding therapy","story":"In our new era of ‘romantic realism’, more and more couples are seeking out counselling before they get married, rather than waiting for impossible problems to ariseWhen Thomas and Jenny approached a couples therapist before their wedding, they weren’t expecting it to become a long-term commitment. “Initially we decided to see a counsellor due to some trust issues in our relationship,” he says. “We found premarital therapy incredibly helpful, because it gave us a safe space to communicate with each other without fear of repercussion. It became an important part of the relationship – even when things were going well.”After their wedding this summer, the couple continued to attend sessions while they settled into marriage. By discussing potential problems with an unbiased third party, Thomas says they both felt confident to be more open with each other.It also helped them to work on their communication styles, which has further strengthened their relationship. “It’s not just what you say, but when and how you say it. Before therapy, I might say something critical first thing in the morning and Jenny would immediately become defensive. We’ve learned that we communicate better when we allocate a time to sit down after dinner and rationally discuss things.”Although the couple dated for eight years before they got married, Thomas believes that counselling prepared them for the changes that come with marriage. “Even after all that time, therapy opened my eyes to new things about Jenny. It helped me to understand that people deal with issues in different ways and I have become better at seeing things from her perspective.”While premarital or wedding therapy may sound unromantic to some, for many couples, it is a way to future-proof a relationship and smash the dangerous illusion of the fairytale ending. “We had a fantastic connection when we met, but over time you have to put effort into a relationship,” says Thomas.It might seem out of the ordinary, but Cate Campbell, a sex and relationship therapist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says such therapy is on the rise. “In the past five years, this type of counselling has become increasingly popular,” she says. “I think people are becoming increasingly realistic about relationships.”However loved-up couples seem on their wedding day, the Office for National Statistics shows that the average marriage in the UK lasts 12 years. It is a far cry from the “happy ever after” ending promised by books and movies, which could explain why more couples are taking a proactive approach to maintaining healthy relationships.Unlike traditional couples therapy, which is often attended after a serious relationship breakdown, premarital therapy aims to prevent problems before they arise. It can cover a wide range of topics tailored to the couple, including money management, parenting, holidays, sex and other issues.“Sometimes I see couples who consider themselves soulmates. When they realise they have differences, this can be very hard to digest and they run into problems,” says Campbell. During the honeymoon phase, any small disagreements are often obscured by oxytocin, the love hormone that helps us to bond and reproduce. “Once we commit to each other or have a baby, this starts to wear off. That’s where small problems can start to escalate.”For many religious communities, premarital counselling isn’t a new phenomenon. When Georgina Fuller got married 11 years ago, she was expected to take a six-week marriage preparation course, run by priests. “It was mandatory so that we could marry in the Catholic church,” she says.“We went once a week for a couple of hours and got advice about our relationship. It included topics such as shared values, and managing expectations about marriage. They advised couples to discuss how they would want to bring up children together. It’s a very important thing to talk about and it’s not always the first thing people think of when they’re in love and planning a wedding.”Although elements of the course were useful, Fuller says the heavy focus on religion was alienating. “I felt the course was more about telling us what to do so that we could be good Catholics, as opposed to listening to us and helping us to understand our feelings. I think traditional therapy, where couples discuss their feelings openly with their partner, is more helpful.”As the complexities of modern life increase and people live more secular lives, many people are turning to independent, non-religious counselling for support. Last year, the School of Life in London introduced premarital psychotherapy to help couples build on the existing foundations of their relationship.“Our pre-marriage or pre-commitment therapy isn’t just for people getting married,” says Charlotte Fox Weber, the head of psychotherapy for the school. “It could be for couples who are having a baby or buying a house together. We support people to understand the realities of taking their relationship to the next level.”Known as “romantic realism”, more than 70 couples have signed up for premarital therapy since the sessions were launched. “We have seen a big rise in the number of young couples attending therapy, but we’re also seeing older couples who have been orced, recognised they made mistakes and want to make things work this time around.”Fox Weber says that some couples are even given therapy sessions as a wedding gift. “Sometimes people think they’re so in love that they don’t need therapy. But counselling can make a good life even better. It’s like taking out breakdown cover before your car breaks down.”It is something that Angela wishes she had considered when she got married in 2010, after a three-year engagement. “I never imagined anything could go wrong. We were so in love on our honeymoon, it made me wonder how relationships ever break down.” But almost a decade on, she is able to see how easily cracks can form. “We’ve faced a lot of stress over the years which has been hard to cope with,” she says.At the end of 2012, her partner lost his job shortly after the birth of their first child. The couple moved from their home in Australia to New Zealand to find work, which left Angela homesick and without the support of her extended family. By the time her second child was born two years later, she was struggling to keep her head above water.“Premarital therapy prepares you for what’s to come and there was a lot I wasn’t expecting,” she says. “I had no idea how difficult it would be to have two small children, or how much I would struggle with losing my financial independence on maternity leave. It became harder to discuss these issues with my partner because I was so exhausted I couldn’t even articulate how I was feeling.”Although she recognises, in hindsight, that these emotions are normal, it made her feel there was something wrong. “Communication starts to break down so quickly when you’re tired and stressed. Every tiny thing can build into resentment. Therapy helps you to see the potential pitfalls to prevent these clashes from happening.”The couple are extremely happy now, but it has taken time to iron out their differences. “One of the most important things for me is realising that when you are in a relationship, you are still an independent person responsible for your own happiness,” says Angela.In 2017, she made the decision to retrain as a mindset and success coach, which she believes has given her the tools she needs to take control of her own life. “Once I had this, it was easy to see how to get my marriage to a great place again.”Her sentiments are echoed by Campbell, who says that part of being in a healthy relationship is having confidence in yourself. “You need to feel happy that you can disagree with your partner and the world won’t end,” she says. “In reality, soulmates and perfect relationships do not exist. But premarital therapy can help two iniduals build strong foundations for the future.”(Some names have been changed)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad88fd33ba859197f16fbfe38eba72e5f6671727/0_9_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22ea88bb53a282a3263380d9ef461726","title":"hannah dines on going public with her labia surgery it started a big conversation","story":"The Paralympic cyclist wrote about the damage the sport had caused her. The article caused an outcry, others with similar experiences contacted her – and manufacturers finally began designing saddles for womenThe day after I wrote in the  about how my life as a female cyclist, and Paralympian, led to me having reconstructive surgery of my vulva – all because saddles are not designed for women – a book arrived in the post. It was The Vagina Bible by Dr Jen Gunter. It was a gift from my mum, who had read the searing details about my labial surgery. She has always had a good sense of humour.The response from other people was overwhelming. That is the thing when you share – people share back. When the first professional cyclist contacted me to tell me she had gone through the same thing, the relief was so profound that I cried. I can now say with certainty that there are other people like me who, due to the wrong kind of pressure, experienced a cycle of chronic inflammation and swelling. These are people for whom cycling is as necessary to life as breathing and they face an impossible dilemma.There was an awkward moment when I turned up for my gym session to the sound of Greg James interviewing me on Radio 1 about my vulva. The media furore was so huge, so unexpected and went on for so long that I began hoping the fame might go away.What happened next, though, was that I became the UK’s unofficial agony aunt for saddle trauma. Writing about my surgery started a conversation where there was silence before. Thanks to more female staff in cycling team environments, more social media groups, more newspaper articles, more doctors who listen and give you choice, and manufacturers that admit there might be a problem with their products, prevention is in sight.The professional US cyclist Alison Tetrick had the same surgery as me. She pushed her sponsor, Specialized, to take seriously the problems women on her team were having with their saddles. A two-year research project led to the only saddle I can now use without pain (the Power Saddle with Mimic technology). We are holding our breath for Specialized’s forthcoming 3D-printed saddle technology – basically a carbon cast of your bottom that should ensure all lumps and bumps are accounted for. It would be remiss not to stress that saddles are designed with men in mind. That is why an inidually customisable solution holds so much hope. Saddles can fail anyone. Yet women already face a data gap, as is so evident in Caroline Criado Perez’s book Invisible Women, and we can no longer ignore it. Accessing effective medical treatment is harder and solutions are more expensive. Bike parts, technological developments and racing procedures are all geared towards men.Jasmijn Muller is an ultra-endurance racer and winner of the World 24-hour TT Championships. When I asked her to rate her saddle comfort since having her second of two vulval surgeries at the end of 2018, the answer was 1010. This year, she has perfected her bike position, dealt with saddle pressure and even has special inserts in her shoes. Her battle was slightly different from mine – a recurring bacterial infection that was so bad it was tracking down her legs and up to her stomach. She is soon to be a coach. I am excited by this. A few of us were told by cycling mentors that what we were experiencing was normal. I wonder what the world would be like if every coach was like Muller.I wrote about my surgery because I wanted friends in this fight. Now I have them. Since the article was published, I have presented at the British Lymphology Society’s annual conference and there is now a dedicated clinic in London for swelling-related saddle trauma. There are saddle-pressure projects running at Dundee and Manchester universities and I am attempting to form a network of all surgeons who have performed the relevant procedures in hopes that, one day, there will be a go-to best-practice guide.Oh, and I won a bronze World Cup medal and crashed out at the world championships. I will leave you with my favourite Phoebe Waller-Bridge skit for Saturday Night Live. “Think about how many of them are in this room, right now. Just think about all the genitals, all across America, sat on couches right now,” she said. The genitals that are still being crushed into oblivion on bike saddles. But I’m so glad we can talk about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

His albums spent 41 weeks at the top in total, his singles 38, making a total of 79 weeks – more than any other artist. No other artist meanwhile has spent more time in the Top 40 singles chart than Sheeran’s combined 572 weeks.Sheeran said: “This is nuts – I didn’t really expect to have a career past five years, so to be able to have done it for a decade, … ” OCC chief executive Martin Talbot said Sheeran’s achievement was “truly remarkable”.It’s the latest in a string of record-breaking stats for Sheeran, who staged the world’s highest-grossing tour ever this year – it earned £558m ($775m), overtaking a tally set by U2 in 2011.With Sheeran currently in the Top 10 with his single South of the Border, he has become one of four artists to score more than 1,000 weeks in the UK Top 75. Only Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and Rihanna have a higher tally than his 1,002 weeks.His song Shape of You was named the biggest song of the decade, reaching 4.3m “combined sales” – the figure drawn from a combination of streams and downloads.

Johnson spent Tuesday in Staffordshire attempting to recover from a disastrous previous day, when he refused to look at a photo of a sick boy lying on the floor of a hospital in Leeds and his advisers then wrongly briefed that an aide had been punched.With polling stations due to open at 7am on Thursday, Corbyn will say it is time for people to vote for “a Labour government that will be on your side a Labour government that will save our NHS”.“It’s time for a pay rise for 12 million people, for lower fares and bills, and for free childcare,” he will say in a speech in Middlesbrough in the north-east on Wednesday.“It’s time for pension justice for women born in the 1950s, and for free personal care for pensioners. And it’s time for everyone to have free education and decent jobs.“We will put money in your pocket because you deserve it. The richest and big business will pay for it. We will save our NHS by giving it the money it needs, ending privatisation and by not selling it out to Trump.”He will argue that Thursday’s choice is the “most important election in a generation”, in which people have the chance “to vote for a government for the many, not the few”.Johnson, who will start his day on a milk-round in Yorkshire at 7am, said the Tories could not be complacent about being ahead in the polls and said the election remained “close-fought”.Asked at a campaign event in a JCB factory in Staffordshire whether the general election was “in the bag”, the prime minister insisted “absolutely not”.“This is a very close-fought election, and we need every vote,” he told his audience of factory workers at a carefully staged event. “The only mathematical alternative to a working majority for a Conservative government is the real, real risk of another hung parliament. That’s another five years of confusion, chaos, dither and delay. We cannot go down that route.”In an attempt to emphasise his point, he drove a union jack-emblazoned bulldozer through a wall of polystyrene blocks in a stunt for the TV cameras.He told JCB workers: “We’ve only got 48 hours to get this thing done. I want you now to reflect on the gravity of the choice we have before us. This is a momentous occasion for our country. I’ve never seen an election quite like it.”Labour quickly countered with an edited version of the clip that made it look as if Johnson was tearing down the NHS.The prime minister also sought to exploit comments by the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, whose downbeat remarks about Labour’s chances were leaked by a “friend”.“Jon Ashworth made absolutely clear that he thinks the reason Mr Corbyn is failing to persuade large numbers of people to vote for him is he is blocking Brexit, he won’t get Brexit done,” Johnson said. “He’s absolutely right.”In an apparent bid to reach out to voters who supported remain in 2017, he said: “We want to respect the will of the people. We’re democrats. I mean, whether we’re leavers or remainers, whichever way we voted, we’ve come together and we want to get it done. We can we’ve got a deal.”Johnson was accompanied by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, at the first of several stage-managed appearances as the Tories sought to get their campaign back on track for the final 48 hours.The prime minister was challenged on Monday over the photograph of a four-year-old boy, Jack Williment-Barr, sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital, and responded by pocketing the journalist’s phone. And his aides were later accused of lying about an incident outside the same hospital involving an aide to the health secretary, Matt Hancock.Javid introduced the prime minister at JCB by warning that a Labour government would create an economic crisis by Christmas.“Corbyn has a programme for government that is far left, that is the most anti-business, the most anti-enterprise, this country has ever seen. It will guarantee an economic crisis,” he said.“Normally a Labour government takes a few years to leave a crisis,” he added. “With this lot, it won’t be years it won’t be months it won’t even be weeks it will be days.

As well as offering constituency recommendations, it takes account of the other seven tactical voting sites, although voters should look at past results to get a full picture.The reality is that in the vast majority of seats in England and Wales it is Labour that is best placed to defeat the Conservatives. But this is the part of the UK where the Liberal Democrats are most relevant.Labour needs particular support here, where pro-remain vote-splitting in London means that the Conservatives could retake Kensington (Lab majority 20) and Battersea (Lab maj 2,416) – as well as outside London in Canterbury (Lab maj 187) and Portsmouth South (Lab maj 1,554).There are handful of Conservative held seats where the residual Lib Dem vote is greater than the winning majority: Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346), and Norwich North (Con maj 507). Other key Labour targets where there has been a significant Lib Dem vote include Watford (Con maj 2,092).This is more clearcut, because the Lib Dems are generally not registering among voters in this part of the country, although Tim Farron’s narrow 777 seat majority means that support from those who voted Labour last time could help him hang on in Westmorland and Lonsdale.Key seats where Labour particularly needs support from the often small number of previous Lib Dem voters include: Newcastle-under-Lyme (Lab maj 30), Bishop Auckland (Lab maj 502) and Colne Valley (Lab maj 915).Labour targets, which could in theory be taken with residual support from the Lib Dems, include Pudsey (Con maj 331) and Stoke-on-Trent South (Con maj 663). The party also appears best placed in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, even though the sitting MP, Anna Soubry, is running for the Independent Group for Change.By contrast the Lib Dems best hope is Cheadle, south Manchester, where the party is in second place, chasing a Conservative majority of 4,507.Labour is fighting a defensive operation in Wales, where it held Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832) and Gower (Lab maj 3,269) with less than half the vote at the last election and needs the support of Plaid Cymru and Lib Dem supporters.However, if Plaid voters switched – and Labour could hold its vote despite the regional polling – then it could in theory gain Preseli Pembrokeshire (Con maj 314) and Aberconwy (Con maj 635) from the Conservatives.The Lib Dems best chance is to hang on to Brecon and Radnorshire, which it won at a byelection from the Conservatives in August, and Plaid’s main concern would be to see off the Tories in Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Plaid maj 4,850).Against that backdrop, in every Conservative held seat, the nearest challengers are the SNP, with Stirling the top target (Con maj 148) followed by Gordon (Con maj 2,607) and Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Con maj 2,774), where there are enough Labour votes to unseat the Tory.The SNP meanwhile, needs support to defend seats like Perth and North Perthshire, which it held by 21 votes from the Conservatives. And while Labour would dearly like to make gains from the SNP, in an anti-Tory tactical voting guide the focus is elsewhere.Finally, in Northern Ireland, nationalists voting against the Conservative party’s former confidence and supply partners, the Democratic Unionist party, are expected to lead to the DUP losing Belfast South (DUP maj 1,996) to the Social Democratic and Labour party, and possibly Belfast North (DUP maj 2,081), where Nigel Dodds is standing, to Sinn Féin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2437fbdaef129eafc978dd35f6f5e73546718c7c/0_85_632_379/master/632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f085c79f7a702447c5f2d771f270172d","title":"tories open second investigation sally ann hart hastings candidate","story":"Sally-Ann Hart faces inquiries over alleged Islamophobia and antisemitismThe Conservatives are investigating election candidate Sally-Ann Hart for alleged Islamophobia just days after opening an inquiry into her for liking a Nazi phrase on Facebook and sharing an antisemitic slur.Labour has made fresh calls for the Tories to suspend their candidate in the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye, who was also publicly condemned last week for implying that disabled people should be paid less than the minimum wage because they do not understand money.The latest allegations relate to a post that Hart shared on her Facebook wall in 2017, in which she described a blog by anti-Islam activist and author Cheri Berens as an “affecting read”.In the blog, Berens claimed the Women’s March against Trump in the US had been used to promote the “Muslim agenda” in the US and that the Muslim Brotherhood had hijacked the movement.She claimed this was because they want American women to have abortions to limit the non-Muslim population, adding that American women should not wear the headscarf and wherever it is worn in the world there is oppression.Berens also claimed that the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist movement founded in Egypt, want to destabilise American youth and that they control the media.A Conservative spokesperson said: “Sally Ann Hart is under investigation and these comments will form part of that investigation.“Our complaints process is rightly a confidential one but there are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour, including conditions to undertake training, periods of suspension and expulsion, and these are applied on a case-by-case basis.”Boris Johnson has claimed that any of his candidates found to be discriminating against people would be “out first bounce”.Hart has not been suspended pending an investigation into alleged antisemitism and continues to stand for the Tory-Labour marginal seat which was previously held by former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd.“They want a young male population that is weakened or with confused female tendencies, whether real or imagined, or transgendered. They want to oppress the women and weaken the men. And the rest of America? They are controlling you via the media.”She claimed the Women’s March was not about Trump but used as a scapegoat for the Muslim agenda in the US.Hart shared the post on 25 January 2017, shortly before she was selected to stand in Durham North West at that year’s general election. Laura Pidcock went on to win the seat for Labour.Labour’s shadow equalities minister, Naz Shah, said: “This disgusting Islamophobia and homophobia have no place in our society. And no one who spreads these vile far-right conspiracy theories is fit to be an MP.“Boris Johnson has claimed that Conservative members who do this sort of thing are ‘out first bounce’. So it defies belief that Sally-Ann Hart was selected as a candidate in the first place, and it is shameful that Boris Johnson is now failing to take action.” reported on Saturday how Hart was already being investigated for sharing a video in 2017 with an image suggesting that Jewish billionaire George Soros controls the EU. She also liked a comment left underneath the footage that said “Ein Reich”, which is a Nazi slogan.Last week she was filmed at a hustings saying: “Some people with learning disabilities, they don’t understand about money. It’s about the happiness to work.”In a separate development, a Tory activist who was suspended from the party for trying to make a “joke” about the New Zealand terror attack on Muslims has been allowed to return.Martin Oddy, who wrote the words “shoe sale in New Zealand” on a Conservative Facebook group after 51 worshippers were murdered in March by a far-right activist in Christchurch, has returned to the Conservative party after completing an online ersity course.A friend of Oddy said the businessman, who is a supporter of the Brexiter MP Andrea Jenkyns, maintained a right to tell jokes about any subject. “He is back in the party and back helping the Conservatives again,” the friend said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/697f1786d218076b73ff08497a3a8d25567f79ea/0_149_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5006da5f651d70e6945272bf94fea28","title":"building reconciliation genocide social work rwanda","story":"The profession has played a key role in helping communities overcome ides and become self-reliantIn the lush hills and valleys of Rwanda, change is blossoming as villagers meet to plan their futures and to build better housing and schools. During a visit coordinated by the National Organisation of Social Workers (NOSW), I saw the powerful contribution of social work to restoring a nation torn apart by genocide, working towards a reconciliatory and vibrant future.The social work profession in Rwanda was formed following the 1994 genocide, which had its roots in the colonialist ide-and-rule administration and systematic oppression of the Tutsi population. After the slaughter of more than 800,000 people, Rwanda’s social fabric was in tatters. Economic institutions collapsed, there was widespread displacement and many women were pregnant as the result of rape.However, Consolee Uwihangana of the NOSW stresses: “The story of Rwanda is one of overcoming the history sown by the colonists. Ours is a story of reconciliation, repair and self-reliance, and as a nation we have made immense strides.”Social work has been a key factor in making this progress, through homegrown solutions or indigenous models of development that address the many layers of social wounds. Uwihangana explains the role of social workers: “We are counsellors, community facilitators, advocates and policy influencers. We work both with iniduals and whole communities as the nation needs to work together to overcome the challenges.”Among other approaches, social workers have been deeply involved with programmes such as umuganda (community work), ubudehe (local collective action) and girinka (one cow per poor family).With girinka, social workers are using an indigenous tradition as a vehicle for community change. A cow is issued to every poor family and, according to Charles Kalinganire of NOSW: “Giving the firstborn calf to your neighbour has been an enormous part of the reconciliation process, as neighbours and villagers to this day swap cows, reinforcing their connections and bonds.”Another inspiring example of social change from Rwanda’s capital city, Kigali, is Hope and Homes for Children, a community hub that prevents children from being abandoned. Emery Nduwimana, a social worker with the charity, explains that some of the factors that contribute to child abandonment include parental trauma resulting from rape, family isolation, drug abuse, vulnerability and stigma towards children with disabilities.As we drive into the mid-city community along the red earth road, Nduwimana points out the range of activity at the centre. In one classroom the walls are vibrating from loud drumming as young men practise traditional dance. “Our traditional culture is a safe and vibrant setting for them,” Nduwimana says before leading me to a classroom where adults are learning English as skills for employment.Outside, a group of women in patterned dresses and brightly coloured head scarves are holding a weekly meeting to administer their community finances. The programme offers loans to community members, supporting their entrepreneurial plans and providing relief when times are hard.There is still more work to be done to promote reconciliation in Rwanda – but as the fragrances of eucalyptus and pine drift through the air, I am hopeful. It’s clear from the absence of street children and beggars, and the inclusive gatherings of men and women planning their collective futures, that innovative social work has made an impact.Rwandans are right to be proud: in a short timeframe, the nation has achieved unparalleled progress in reconciliation and development. Social work has played a vital role in this success.• Rory Truell is secretary-general of the International Federation of Social Workers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba5f242997b09b57b0b5bec427dcc2cbc97bfd16/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9612b669ae9f0d692e29c18c55e7ca87","title":"trees labour green policies public buildings transport councils cash","story":"All parties agree on tree-planting as well as greening buildings and transport. Yet whoever wins, councils will struggle to find the cashTrees have had an unexpectedly good election, with every major party pledging to plant millions more of them. The exact numbers vary, and some parties seem unsure even what their own target may involve, but a huge national increase in foliage is one of the few policies that bridges the vast political distance between the Greens and the Brexit party.How this plays out on the ground will be another issue – even if all the promised trees are planted, about a quarter of saplings die long before maturity, and the types of tree and location will be big factors. Local authorities are likely to come in for a big share of the heavy work, whichever party wins, but how the budgets and responsibility for this massive climate-protecting project will be devolved remains opaque in most of the manifestos. Local parks spending may continue to be squeezed, even while national forests are high on the agenda.A similar vagueness over implementation dogs many of the other less eye-catching green policies proposed across the board, even though the public sector – mainly in the form of local authorities – is likely to be key to delivery. From home insulation to transport, renewable energy to waste and recycling, the infrastructure pledges made by all the major parties will require public sector oversight, spending, workers and planning.Hospitals, schools and other public buildings are all promised a share of the cash for upgrading and insulating buildings, which are one of the UK’s biggest sources of emissions. By 2030, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens would insulate every home, and in most cases other buildings too, while the Conservatives will spend £9.2bn on insulation nationwide.Electric cars are also a central environmental pledge, with the three biggest parties all targeting a phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles, and an expansion of charging infrastructure. Restoring and expanding bus routes looms large for Labour, which would electrify all buses for £4bn, and the Lib Dems have pledged £4.8bn to restore local bus routes. The Conservatives promise £4.2bn for local trains, buses and trams.Pledges are easy to make, so perhaps the most important question is which party is likely to take its manifesto pledges on the environment seriously in government. An assessment of the main parties’ pledges by Friends of the Earth put Labour at the top, closely followed by the Green party and the Liberal Democrats, all scoring between 30 and 33 out of a possible 45. The Conservatives – whose leader, Boris Johnson, refused to take part in a televised climate debate – scored just 5.5 points."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a5d2acb2873abc14bed956a93236f61b4fd467/0_1242_2678_1607/master/2678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2f5d5dfe6bccef4b42f69d3c0008aaa","title":"buy a classic sport photograph the big splash","story":"The tenth of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free deliveryWhile most other photographers took their places on the sidelines of the athletics track at the White City stadium for the 1965 British Games, photographer Gerry Cranham, always hunting something a little different, ducked down alongside one of the steeplechase hurdles and awaited his quarry.

And when you are constantly not being listened to – and constantly berated – there comes a time when you think should I put my efforts elsewhere? Without making knee-jerk reactions I think a lot will happen in the next 48 hours.”On Monday Wada’s president, Sir Craig Reedie, announced Russia would be banned from global competitions for four years after manipulating and deleting doping data from its Moscow laboratory. However, Wada also agreed that inidual Russian athletes would still be able to compete internationally if they could prove they were not tainted.Reedie also rejected calls for a blanket ban from Wada’s athlete commission, calling them a “ginger group” and saying full bans didn’t work. However, Aggar said those comments were both “laughable and disrespectful”.“I thought about quitting when Wada made the Russian Anti-Doping Agency compliant again last year so I don’t want to be the person that cries wolf and never acts on it after this appalling decision,” she added. “But, while I’ve hoped that things might head in the right direction, it’s looking pretty bleak at the minute.“ I also know Wada would love me to leave because I am challenging them.”Aggar has received the full support of Scott, who told the  that the fight against doping was in a difficult place. “It just feels like an uphill battle,” she said. “There is a real disconnect between the athlete commission and leadership at Wada.“The commission is really dedicated and passionate about protecting clean athletes. However, at a time when Wada’s Executive Committee finally had the power and authority to take legal action against such blatant corruption from Russia, it chose not to. It is surreal.”Adam Pengilly, the second British member of Wada’s athlete commission, also said he supported a full ban on Russian athletes because of the country’s failure to tackle widespread state-sponsored doping.“Nothing has worked,” he said. “I’ve been reluctant to call for a full ban but until the system changes athletes will continue to get exploited in Russia.“I have been told by a Russian friend in sport that it is a collective system and the majority of those who were around five to 10 years ago are still there. So the 12-year-old girl who wants to be a 1500m runner will probably be at major risk of having to be pushed into doping later in her career.”Meanwhile, Rob Koehler, who heads the athlete-led movement Global Athlete, said a significant number of leading sportsmen and women had contacted him to express their frustration with Wada.“It is a step backwards compared to where we were in 2016, when Wada recommended a complete ban on Russia for the Olympics and Paralympics,” added Koehler, who was previously the deputy general of Wada. “Reedie now says that blanket bans don’t work – but the example of South Africa under apartheid suggests otherwise.”Koehler also warned that the decision not to stand up to Russia would have worrying consequences. “I think the credibility of Wada had already deteriorated but this decision has made it worse,” he added. “The problem is that Russia is powerful. They host events and there is a lot of Russian representatives on various international sports boards, so their influence is wide and their tentacles are everywhere.”The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said his country have “reason to appeal” against the four-year ban imposed on Monday, claiming he did not agree with collective punishment. “The main thing, in my opinion, and it seems to me that everyone agrees with it, is that any punishment – since the times of Roman law – should be inidual and based on what that inidual did,” he added.However, the head of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, told the  the court of arbitration for sport might also listen to an appeal from clean athletes who feel Wada’s sanctions against Russia do not go far enough.“Cas rules allow for parties to intervene when it is appropriate and they are adversely affected,” he said. “Whether the athletes end up doing that will be their choice but, if Cas agrees with them, it would then have the ability to increase any punishment on Russia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ce2c0f201395913633cc52b651d50bcfbabbc5/0_237_4727_2836/master/4727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ca827def2d43f383f07d0e4ec58f4c","title":"ian foster named steve hansens successor as all blacks head coach","story":"New Zealand’s wait for a new All Blacks head coach is over after Ian Foster, Steve Hansen’s former assistant, was promoted to the position on a two-year contract. Foster was on a two-man shortlist for the job – one of the most high-profile and scrutinised roles in the country – after Hansen stepped down following the recent World Cup.The 54-year-old got the nod ahead of Crusaders coach Scott Robertson as New Zealand Rugby chose to continue its succession policy of filling the top job from within. Foster served as Hansen’s assistant for eight years and played an integral part in a golden era for the All Blacks which included an unbeaten season in 2013 and World Cup success in 2015.“The NZR board has today ratified Ian Foster as the new head coach of the All Blacks from 2020,” NZR chairman Brent Impey said. “He brings world-class international experience to the role, an incredibly strong coaching team, and we think he’ll do an outstanding job.”Hansen, who himself replaced his former boss Graham Henry in 2012 after a similarly lengthy stint as assistant, stepped down at the conclusion of the recent World Cup in Japan, where the All Blacks reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by England. The defeat ended Kiwi hopes of securing a third successive world title.NZR said it conducted a “lengthy and robust interview process” before settling on its preferred candidate, who has already assembled his back-room staff with four other coaches, to be named in due course.“The interview process was extensive and really difficult, which reflects the very strong applications from both candidates,” Impey said. “While we can’t confirm the full make-up of the coaching team today, we’re delighted with the quality they bring – they have a wide range of coaching experiences and are a erse group of thinkers.”Foster’s appointment heralds a new chapter for rugby in New Zealand, with a new CEO of the game’s governing body, Mark Robinson, also on his way in following Steve Tew’s announcement in June that he would step away at the end of the year.“These are exciting times,” Robinson said. “Ian has pulled together a very strong team and he is an outstanding person in his own right with a high-quality set of values. He is committed to stamping his own mark on the team and it’s clear that he and his coaching team want to bring a new and fresh energy into the All Blacks environment.”Seen as a risky appointment in some parts, Foster’s first task will be to win over a sceptical New Zealand public after the popular Robertson was overlooked. But the former Chiefs coach said he was looking forward to the challenge.“I feel truly privileged and honoured to be given this opportunity and I can’t wait to lead the team into the next chapter of what is a remarkable legacy,” Foster said. “I’m incredibly proud of what we have achieved in the All Blacks over the last eight years and I’m excited and energised by a new coaching team who will join me.”Robinson said the decision to overlook Robertson was not taken lightly. “As someone who knows ‘Razor’ well as a former teammate, he was a very impressive candidate and these decisions are never easy. We know Razor is an outstanding coach and I have no doubt he’ll have a big future in our game at international level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5453371d9b87a742b235e3bb2ffb989bab64f9/63_0_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a8ad515fa1e6c8c555160fa0ce521bf","title":"faustus that damned woman chris bush lyric hammersmith london","story":"In a new version of the enduring myth, Chris Bush sets the story in 17th-century London with a young woman who sells her soulA man (it is almost always a man) strikes a deal for greatness and pays a terrible price for it. The Faust myth teaches us to be careful of what we wish for, that pride comes before a fall, that nothing comes for free. Faustus is bored by the limits of his mortality (and his humanity) and so seeks supernatural aid. Only when the devil comes to claim his due does Faustus realise he has reached too far. He begs forgiveness, but it’s too late – he’s made his bed and now he must lie in it.The story endures because greed endures, and ambition endures, and we are never short of contemporary figures who believe they can beat the system, or that the rules needn’t apply to them. A modern Faustus might be a tech billionaire, a doctor playing God, or a Boris Johnson-type signing over his soul to a Mephistophelian Dominic Cummings figure – the only part that may feel like a stretch is that, in most versions, Faustus gets his comeuppance.However, there is one element of the story that I often find unsatisfying. Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus has moments of genius but thoroughly derails itself in the middle, primarily because Faustus doesn’t really do anything of note with his powers. He is granted near unlimited gifts and he squanders them pulling pranks and playing tricks. I think this is partially because Marlowe’s Faustus never has a real need for the devil. He is already a successful medical doctor whose bills are “hung up as monuments, whereby whole cities have escaped the plague”. He’s on top as it is. Now, the story of a man who has everything and yet still yearns for more is not uninteresting, but I think it misses a trick.In my new play, my Faustus is a young woman in 17th-century London, the daughter of a plague doctor father and a herbalist mother who was tried and killed as a witch when Faustus was a girl. She’s grown up with a mistrust of organised religion and a fascination with the occult, and exists on the fringes of society. She has no wealth and little agency. By the time she meets Lucifer she knows the risks but sees his offer as the least bad option available to her. As she tells him:Why then how could this fate be any worseThan to be bound to any common man?Oh, if you knew the lives we women leadYou’d understand the Devil is a catch.Faustus sells her soul in order to control her destiny, and to ensure what happened to her mother cannot happen to her (or any other woman). The deal she strikes is similar, but her road to damnation is driven by a very different set of circumstances. Faustus’s sex (and social class) doesn’t just affect her motivations it also affects how she’s treated and what she’s able to do with the gifts she’s given. Through this, the play becomes a study of how we treat women who pursue greatness, and how traits that seem admirable in men here might warrant damnation. I wanted to create an epic, ambitious, gothic, baroque fever dream of a piece that took a well-known classic and inverted it to say something truthful about the contemporary female experience.About five years ago, I decided to stop writing male protagonists for a while. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule (and one I broke when making Pericles for the National Theatre last year, although we did explore what a female Pericles might have looked like), but it’s something I intend to stick with for a little while longer. This wasn’t intended as a huge political gesture, but it’s one tiny thing I can do to try to redress the gender imbalance that exists across our stages.The western canon is dominated by male leads, and our industry is stuffed with incredible women who shouldn’t be relegated to always playing someone’s wife or mother. Quite aside from that, it makes my work more interesting, especially when reimagining existing stories. Inserting a woman into a traditionally male narrative complicates things. It creates more edges and obstacles. It highlights the way in which women still operate in a world designed by and for men, and how their very presence can send a story we think we know into strange and exciting directions.That said, the Faust myth endures because it is universal, and I don’t think any of that changes with this new retelling. It’s still the same story of vaulting ambition, hubris and exceptionalism, of what we’re prepared to sacrifice to achieve greatness, of the tantalising thought that, despite all the evidence, we might finally be the one to outsmart the devil. None of this is lost by having a female Faustus, although hopefully it brings into focus the way in which women are still punished for their ambition in a way men often aren’t.My Faustus is by no means a saint.

But it’s a line that could just as easily have been uttered by the lead of one of 2019’s best TV shows, Russian Doll, in which a wisecracking New Yorker named Nadia Vulvokov finds herself caught in a traumatic Groundhog Day-style loop, repeatedly dying and then revisiting the same day again and again. Instead, she goes with a slightly more vexed alternative: “The universe is trying to fuck with me! And I refuse to engage!”Nadia (Natasha Lyonne) is the central character of the eight-episode dramedy, which landed out of nowhere in February and proved to be one of the funniest, saddest and trippiest shows of the year. Every day Nadia is back: at a birthday party thrown for her by her obnoxious hipster friend Maxine, who coos the words “sweet birthday baby” as she offers her a joint laced with cocaine. And back in a place where everyone is completely oblivious to the fact that she can’t stop dying.Along with The Good Place and Maniac, Russian Doll – produced by Lyonne, Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland – continued the trend for existential crises on TV, but pushed it to blackly comic new depths. Nadia’s predicament is so strange, she tells Maxine, that “explaining it might give us both an aneurysm.” She consults a rabbi and her therapist – a friend of her late mother’s – who try to help her with what appears to be psychosis, but it’s all in vain. She ends up freezing to death, being run over or electrocuted before being shunted back to the party each time. Indeed, her death is the show’s one constant, a coda that pulls us back to that original refrain (and to the actual musical refrain that plays every time she is reincarnated: Harry Nilsson’s Gotta Get Up). Everything comes focalised via Nadia – irascible, vulnerable, whip-smart and, like the show’s viewers, extremely confused.That is, until she links up with Alan (Charlie Barnett), who has to relive the end of his relationship with his brilliantly stuck-up PhD student girlfriend (Lyonne’s Orange Is the New Black co-star Dascha Polanco) every day. Their parallel tortures begin to interweave, illuminating what has actually been happening and allowing them to save one another. For Alan, that means confronting the truth about the night of the breakup, and the fact that he wanted to end his life. For Nadia, it means facing up to the trauma caused by her mother, Leonora, whose suicide rumbles gently through Russian Doll like a faraway train before eventually crashing into the centre of the action, when Chloë Sevigny shows up as the chronically unstable Leonora in a sepia-tinged, melon-flavoured flashback.Nadia and Alan’s mutual support is nothing short of a blessing. Unlike the moral improvement narrative that underpins so many other shows about death, Russian Doll emphasises the need to be there for ourselves and for others, and to be present in the moment. Like addiction, one of the inspirations for the show, Russian Doll presents a cycle with no clear end or beginning, which is often terrifying, and requires human connection to confront. The parallels with Lyonne’s own life made it all the more poignant once tipped for major stardom, her life was derailed by heroin addiction and a string of related health issues. She previously told this newspaper: “At the back of that addiction are feelings that so many of us have, that don’t go away. Isn’t everyone entitled to a moment of existential breakdown in a lifetime?”Here, she plays out that existential breakdown to its logical end – before pulling it back from the brink. In the end, this quirky, haunting and sometimes hysterical show truly was a lifesaver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8efbc520ac10c584a8e8132ef569ea21c124a56/254_386_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabfd2ad2f02431aeca2460ccddf63e","title":"the country faces a bright future finland readers on their new pm","story":"We asked readers in Finland to share their thoughts on the country’s new prime minister. Here’s what some of them saidVery happy that we now have a young female PM with fresh new thoughts on how to lead our beautiful country. She is well educated, bright and does not take any BS from anybody. She is a strong independent woman and a bright new star for her generation. I’m sure she will make a good example for all the young men and women of our world. It’s the young people that need to take over as they are the ones living here long after my generation has passed. Veikko, 65, Ilomantsi, FinlandI cannot recall when politics last made me cry tears of happiness. This did. I experienced my political awakening at age 16. The power that rose from the 2015 elections four years later didn’t look like me. This, now, is what politics is supposed to look like. It is supposed to look into the future, think of the welfare of the people. Ella Kivisaari, student, Helsinki, FinlandShe’s going to have a challenging time finding a way to fund government spending and find a path to improving employment. She’s fresh, popular and brings a major improvement in communication skills but also needs to break her ties with her predecessor Antti Rinne to be able to avoid an impression of being a marionette of his. Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, FinlandBest choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed ‘fresh air’. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

But neither has been willing to compromise on their core demands for a power-sharing agreement. Netanyahu’s recent indictment on corruption charges has added a murky legal imbroglio to the saga.Following September elections, both men failed during their officially mandated time to form a governing coalition on their own. Then, in a final three-week window, they could not join forces to avoid another vote.Both sides said they were working until the last minute to find a way out of the deadlock. However, a breakthrough seemed highly unlikely.With a midnight deadline looming on Wednesday, both sides submitted legislation to dissolve parliament and schedule new elections on 2 March. If the bill is not passed by the deadline, new elections will automatically be triggered on 10 March.Given Israel’s ided state, and the deep mistrust between the opposing camps, there is no guarantee that another vote will break the loop of elections and instability that has rocked the country for the past year.Another campaign, and the national election day holiday, will cost the Israeli economy billions.But there will be an even steeper price caused by nearly 18 months of caretaker governments that cannot carry out major legislation, make appointments or pass budgets, said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute.“The entire decision-making apparatus has been stalled and that has ample implications across the board,” he said. “Israelis are frustrated as a result of the fact that there is no decisive outcome. But there is also an understanding that we are in a very unique and unprecedented situation where a prime minister who is very popular within his own constituency is also being indicted with very severe crimes.”The most straightforward way out of the stalemate would be for Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party to form a unity government with Netanyahu’s Likud. Together, they control a solid majority in the 120-seat Knesset.Gantz’s party refuses to sit with Netanyahu, who was indicted last month on charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-ever serving leader, is desperately clinging to power to wage his legal battle from the favourable perch of prime minister. He has insisted on going first in any alternating leadership arrangement and has refused to drop his alliance with other nationalist and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.Gantz has said he would make a deal with a different leader of Likud. But Netanyahu has so far managed to fend off a burgeoning insurrection inside his party, with just one major figure, Gideon Saar, daring to openly challenge him.“If I am elected head of Likud, I will lead it to victory,” Saar said on Tuesday, citing polls that he was more likely to be able to build a stable coalition. “It is very clear, on the other hand, that if we keep the current course we will not get anywhere better than we have in the last two elections.”With all the other top Likud officials lining up behind him, Netanyahu is expected to beat Saar in any primary vote.Netanyahu is not legally compelled to step down after being indicted, but Israeli law is ambiguous about whether he could be given authority to form a new government after the next election. The attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, who was harshly criticised by both sides throughout the lengthy process he took to press charges, will be required to rule on that question as well as before a likely court challenge.Recent opinion polls have forecast a similar deadlock if new elections are held.Avigdor Lieberman, a former Netanyahu ally, has emerged as a stubborn kingmaker, refusing to endorse either candidate while failing to coax them into a unity government.The maverick politician, who takes a hard line against the Palestinians, has earned some newfound support in liberal circles by also taking a tough stand against ultra-Orthodox parties that hold great influence in Netanyahu’s governments. But he has also faced criticism for the extended impasse.“Voting for Lieberman is a sure path to a fourth election,” wrote Matti Tuchfeld in the Israel Hayom daily. “Lieberman has turned into a one-man blocking majority. You can like him, agree with his opinions, you can love his zigzagging. No problem. But you have to know that a vote for him is a vote for continuing the political vacuum and a perpetual transition government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38e90c86af7cfef99a644fb2526fb22435924159/0_0_8451_5071/master/8451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d254f9d0a47aca42eb366002c00968ee","title":"unique home share scheme diversify media presspad uk mentors room","story":"PressPad’s UK mentors are making room in the industry – and their properties – for aspiring journalistsA social enterprise is trying to tackle the problem by matching established journalists who have a spare room with interns who otherwise would not be able to afford accommodation.PressPad has so far supported 50 young journalists, giving them a place to stay during unpaid internships or work experience as well as valuable support and mentorship. It now hopes to crowdfund £30,000 to hire a coordinator to help expand its operation.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theA large proportion of the UK’s media industry is based in London, where a month’s unpaid internship can cost £1,019 according to research by the Sutton Trust.The BBC journalist Olivia Crellin founded PressPad in 2018 after hearing stories of aspiring journalists unable to afford the costs of starting out. She found that many of her colleagues were keen to improve access to the industry, and a quick Facebook post led to 20 willing hosts.Crellin said: “I had no idea if it would work or if people would be interested in it. Journalists work long hours it’s a very demanding career. So the idea of taking a complete stranger, including one who is likely younger and in need of mentorship, into your home is quite a big ask.”PressPad has about 150 hosts on its books, all of whom are verified media professionals and will soon undergo DBS checks.Interns get their first two weeks of accommodation for free and are charged £150 a week after that, half of which is given to the host, but interns can apply for a means-tested bursary if they are unable to afford this. Media organisations can also buy PressPad “credit” that can be used to fund accommodation for their interns.Annissa Warsame, 20, was one of PressPad’s first interns. She stayed in Greenwich, south-east London with the journalists Kate Middleton and Meirion Jones while she completed an internship at Shine A Light, an investigative journalism project from openDemocracy.Warsame, a history and politics student from Birmingham, said she had no London connections to stay with so discovering PressPad was a stroke of luck.She said: “Kate and Meirion knew that they weren’t just offering a place to stay but they were cultivating this experience that would be something I could look back on when I’m hopefully a more established journalist.”Warsame asked for their advice and feedback after work each day and they had Sunday dinner together. She keeps Middleton and Jones updated on her life and has returned to stay with them for another work experience placement. “They said the door is always open for me.

This is it, the last day of the campaign, the end is in sight, but not before one final flurry of campaigning effort from all the parties. Herein we bring you the election news and the best of the rest – and of course you should follow the day’s live political news here.Labour and the Conservatives are in a frantic scramble for votes as the last day of campaigning begins. Both parties have labelled Thursday’s vote the “most important in a generation” .’s election editorial shares this view, saying “Britain has not faced a more critical election in decades than the one it faces on Thursday”. It urges people to back Labour and “candidates who can defeat the Tories in constituencies where Labour is an also-ran” – asking them to “think of the electrifying impact of relieving Mr Johnson of high office”.Neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is wasting a moment of this last day. The prime minister will be crisscrossing the country from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London, delivering his message that the Conservatives need only another 12 seats to win a majority and that only his party can “get Brexit done”.Corbyn will start his day in Scotland before visiting at least five key seats in a whirlwind tour across England – calling for those who are undecided to “vote for hope in this election”.Both sides insist the election remains closely fought and that polls giving the Conservatives a lead could be wrong. The release of YouGov’s second and much-hyped constituency-by-constituency poll suggests that this is not just a campaign line from the parties and we could be in for a nerve-jangling finish. Compared with the first poll, Labour is two points up, meaning Johnson’s notional majority has been cut from 68 to 28 as his party’s predicted seat count falls by 20 to 339, while Labour’s improves by the same amount to 231. The SNP takes 41 and the Liberal Democrats 15, with some particularly surprising Lib Dem gains predicted.A busy day all round. Johnson will be travelling from Yorkshire to the Midlands, Wales and London.Jo Swinson will be making appearances at a series of rallies.

The 11-year-old girl was propelled from a vessel on the Splash Canyon river rapids ride at Drayton Manor in Staffordshire in May 2017. The inquest jury found that Evha died accidentally. Jurors heard there had been no safety warnings given to guests boarding the ride, warning signs were incomplete or illegible, CCTV was not adequately monitored and no water rescue equipment or training was available to staff.\u0026gt The decline of the British pub may be at an end, according to figures showing that their number has increased for the first time this decade. The UK ended March 2019 with 39,135 pubs, which is 320 more than a year earlier, says the Office of National Statistics (ONS). It is the first net increase since 2010 and contrasts with the previous nine years during which pubs closed at a rate of more than 700 each year. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), though, cautions that its own statistics – due in the new year and covering a higher number of pubs – may not be as bubbly.\u0026gt Labelling food and drinks with how much walking or running is needed to burn them off could help tackle the obesity crisis, researchers say. While nutritional information such as calorie count is mandatory, there is limited evidence it makes people choose healthier food. A study led by Daley calls for small symbols showing how much physical activity is needed to compensate for consuming the item. A fizzy drink containing 138 calories, for example, would take 26 minutes of walking or 13 minutes of running to burn off. “If I tell you something is going to take you 60 minutes of walking to burn, I think most people understand that and know that 60 minutes of walking is a long way,” says Professor Amanda Daley of Loughborough University. A record number of homeless people died in 2018 and charities are warning this year could be worse.

I actually had to back off on the power,” he said.McDougall took the plane on a short trip along the Fraser River near Vancouver international airport in front of around 100 onlookers soon after sunrise. The flight lasted less than 15 minutes, according to an AFP journalist on the scene.“Our goal is to actually electrify the entire fleet,” said McDougall.On top of fuel efficiency, the company would save millions in maintenance costs because electric motors require “drastically” less upkeep, Mr McDougall said.However, Harbour Air will have to wait at least two years before it can begin electrifying its fleet of more than 40 seaplanes.The e-plane has to be tested further to confirm it is reliable and safe. In addition, the electric motor must be approved and certified by regulators.In Ottawa, transport minister Marc Garneau said ahead of the maiden flight that he had his “fingers crossed that the electric plane will work well”. If it does, he said: “It could set a trend for more environmentally friendly flying.”Battery power is also a challenge. An aircraft like the one flown on Tuesday could fly only about 160km on lithium battery power, said Ganzarski. While that’s not far, it’s sufficient for the majority of short-haul flights run by Harbour Air.“The range now is not where we’d love it to be, but it’s enough to start the revolution,” said Ganzarski, who predicts batteries and electric motors will eventually be developed to power longer flights.While the world waits, he said cheaper short-haul flights powered by electricity could transform the way people connect and where they work. “If people are willing to drive an hour to work, why not fly 15 minutes to work?” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4111222.1575999682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new liffey bridge in dublin to cost more than 20m","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA planning design of the proposed Blood Stoney Bridge. Image: Dublin City CouncilThe first dedicated pedestrian and cycle bridge over the Liffey, which will be located in Dublin’s docklands, will cost in excess of €20 million, Dublin City Council has said.The board rejected the council’s plans for a bridge at the same location earlier this year. However, the council said it hopes changes made to the docklands strategic development zone (SDZ), which are under consideration by the board, will lead it to consider the new bridge more positively.The council had planned to build a €17 million bridge 150m further west connecting the old London and North Western Railway Company station on North Wall Quay to Forbes Street on Sir John Rogerson’s Quay south of the river.The Victorian train station was the planned location of a proposed Dart Underground station for the north docks.In mid-2016 the council deferred development of the bridge on the request of the National Transport Authority to allow a review of the Dart Underground plans.Underground stationsThe 7.6km rail line, which was to link Heuston Station to the Dart line, with underground stations at the north docks, Pearse Station, St Stephen’s Green, Christ Church and Heuston, was shelved by the Fine Gael-Labour government in 2011. While it re-emerged in the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, the underground was not included in the 10-year National Development Plan published in 2018.However, as the proposed bridge would run over the reservation strip for the line, the council decided it would be best to move it 150m to the east.But last January the board refused permission for the relocation. It said it believed the original location was “appropriate” owing to its position on a “clear desire line for pedestrians and cyclists between north and south of the river Liffey”.Direct connectionIn the longer term, the board said the Forbes Street bridge would offer the potential of a direct connection from the south of the river to a “ future Dart Underground commuter rail station” at North Wall Quay.“The board considered that, notwithstanding the technical and cost arguments put forward in support of relocation, the existing approved position for the Forbes Street bridge would better serve the interests and amenities of the area in the long term, and would accord with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.”However, councillors were on Monday told changes to the docklands plan would make a positive decision by the board more likely.

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021“At Drax, even without carbon capture, only 32 per cent of the power generated ends up as useful energy,” said Ms\u0026nbspErnsting.\u0026nbsp“That’s already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up as quickly and effectively as Drax has claimed.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects.“We don’t know exactly what the solvent is, how it is produced and how environmentally friendly it is because it is a trade secret,” said Professor Ocone.\u0026nbspA further problem is the cost. Drax said on Tuesday it would not be able to go carbon negative unless it is handed more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show

far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021“At Drax, even without carbon capture, only 32 per cent of the power generated ends up as useful energy,” said Ms\u0026nbspErnsting.\u0026nbsp“That’s already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up as quickly and effectively as Drax has claimed.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects.“We don’t know exactly what the solvent is, how it is produced and how environmentally friendly it is because it is a trade secret,” said Professor Ocone.\u0026nbspA further problem is the cost. Drax said on Tuesday it would not be able to go carbon negative unless it is handed more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3.

That\u0027s all contained within Apple\u0027s stainless steel frame with wheels, and also comes with a mouse, trackpad and keyboard.Apple reveals computer stand that costs $999It is very unlikely that anyone will actually buy the most expensive version of the Mac Pro. Apple has specifically stressed that the aim of the computer is for it to be modular, allowing people to include the expensive, powerful\u0026nbspcomponents they need and not pay for the parts they don\u0027t.It is also likely that anyone spending near the top of the range for the computer will be doing so for a business. Mac Pros are largely used by people in processing intensive jobs such as games design or video editing, where full computing setups regularly cost tens of thousands of dollars.The computer has been teased for more than a year, and Apple has slowly revealed pieces of information about it. At its WWDC event in June, it said that the computer would be coming towards the end of the year and cost $5,999 – but the opening of orders is the first time that the full price has been revealed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAn exit from Asia would mean leaving one of the few international markets where Tesco has experienced sustained success.Despite recent challenges, Thailand had remained an area\u0026nbspearmarked for expansion with Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis unveiling\u0026nbspplans in June to open a further 750 convenience stores.Like-for-like sales at Tesco’s Asia business dropped 6.2 per cent in the last financial year, partly as a result of welfare cards issued by the Thai government that could not be used in Tesco\u0026nbspstores.​​Tesco expanded rapidly into Asia, the US and Europe in the 1990s under former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy but has pared back its overseas ambitions to refocus on the UK in the face of strengthening competition from discount rivals Aldi and Lidl.David Lewis shocks the City by quitting Tesco. What next?Tesco sold its US business Fresh \u0026amp Easy in 2013, citing “cultural differences” and announced a withdrawal from China after failing to make any significant headway with Chinese consumers.\u0026nbspAn accounting scandal\u0026nbspand record losses in 2014 prompted Tesco to launch a turnaround plan which has helped it regain UK market share. That included further disposals including the £4.2bn sale of Tesco’s South Korea business in 2015. If the Lotus sale goes ahead,\u0026nbspTesco\u0026nbspwould have stores only in the UK, Ireland and central Europe.Mr\u0026nbspLewis shocked the retail sector by announcing in October that he would step down at the start of next year.He returned Tesco\u0026nbspto profitability\u0026nbspafter taking the helm in 2014 cutting prices, by slashing\u0026nbspthousands of jobs, overseeing\u0026nbspa merger with wholesaler Booker, and simplifying the product range. The formula helped turn a £6.4bn loss in 2014 into a forecast £2bn profit this year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there appears\u0026nbspto be something in the crisp Surrey air\u0026nbspthat is putting a spring in the step of Lib Dem activists.Harding, a first-time candidate, is hoping to snatch\u0026nbspEsher and Walton from Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and erstwhile Tory leadership contender, in what is being seen as this election’s potential “Portillo moment”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProsperous and leafy, the Surrey seat has been\u0026nbspfaithfully sending Tory MPs to parliament since its creation in 1997. Indeed, the area has not elected an MP who was not a Conservative for more than 100 years.Raab, who has held the seat since 2010, is defending a\u0026nbsp23,000 majority on 12 December but his hardline Brexit stance has put him at odds with his voters, who backed Remain by over 58 per cent.Raab on target list in Lib Dem push for Remain-backing seatsYet Raab is one of the cabinet’s most hardline Brexiteers. In his tilt for the Tory leadership, he was relaxed about a no-deal Brexit and first mooted\u0026nbspthe idea of proroguing parliament.A recent Deltapoll survey put Harding just five points behind Raab on 41 per cent to the Tory minister’s 46 per cent, suggesting Labour voters – who took their party to second place in 2017 – were switching to the Lib\u0026nbspDems.\u0026nbspWhen asked who they would support if only the Tories and the Lib Dems had a realistic chance, the parties were tied on 48 per cent.Veteran pollster Peter Kellner\u0026nbspwrote\u0026nbspat the time: “Dominic Raab’s fierce enthusiasm for Brexit could cost him dear in a constituency that voted Remain in the 2016 referendum.”Tactical voting is likely to play a part here, with the Green candidate standing aside for Harding in the seat. Labour are standing by their candidate Peter Ashurst but Remain campaigners have been piling pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to also fall in line.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said, ‘I’ve been leafleting for the Conservative Party since I was four-years-old, and this is the first time that I have not only not voted for the Conservative Party, but I’m actually now joining another party. So it’s a big deal for me’.”Many voters in the area feel alienated and disenfranchised by Raab’s Brexit stance, she says. “I was one of them which is why I am standing. Because I felt I had no voice.”“Our MP hasn’t moderated his position one little bit in the last three years and in fact he was the first of the Tory leadership to suggest prorogation of parliament and he’s been touting no deal for a long time. Of course, it’s resonating here.”She is confident that she has a good chance of winning, with Brexit the catalyst to a wider picture of discontent.Harding says: “There’s been a huge amount of disquiet in the constituency for a long time.“I think that’s got bigger over the last three years because of the shambles the government have made of Brexit. Because of this position, what was once a moderate, One Nation Conservative Party has moved so far to the right, people are very uncomfortable with that.“They are very uncomfortable with the prorogation of parliament, very uncomfortable with the kind of language that’s coming out of the government at the moment and the misinformation that’s coming on a daily basis. That lands very badly here.”Created with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1927 Lancaster and Fleetwood1927 Lancaster and FleetwoodHarding, a management consultant who has lived in Thames Ditton for more than a decade, sees this as a local fight rather than a national one. Her campaign literature is emblazoned with commitments on Brexit, schools, the NHS and the environment issues.A school governor and a mother-of-four, Harding is also preoccupied with cuts to education funding and provision for children special educational needs (SEN), as well as community policing and hospitals.She says: “What you have got here is a battle between me and Dominic Raab and what we’re saying to voters is you know, you’ve got two very, very different choices here.”\u0026nbspWhen asked if she is worried about taking on\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspbig beast at the polls, she laughs.She says: “Dominic Raab is my MP. At the end of the day he’s answerable to the constituents and I’m a constituent ... I have no problem going up against my local MP who I disagree with – foreign secretary or not.”​One thing that seems to be resonating on the doorstep for Harding was the surprise endorsement of Ian Taylor, the former Tory MP who represented the constituency for 23 years.Hugh Grant reacts to Boris Johnson’s Love Actually spoofTaylor, a former minister, urged Tory voters to abandon a party he “no longer recognises” as he condemned\u0026nbspJohnson for allowing the “damaging threat” of a no-deal Brexit to remain on the table.As well as his endorsement, Harding has been received help from some big names, with Tory grandee Michael Heseltine and ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable visiting the constituency.Hugh Grant, the Love Actually star, joined her to canvas in Walton-on-Thames at the weekend, while Gina Miller, the Remain campaigner, also joined Harding for a lunchtime canvas session in Cobham.“If there is no tactical voting there will be a Tory majority,” she told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “If there is a Tory majority then a referendum is gone.“A hung parliament takes us to a second referendum. If there is a Conservative majority, all routes are closed.”Activists are confident – if a little bemused – by the turn of events.“Leafy Surrey, genteel Surrey. People are standing up and shouting, ‘Enough!’, says Saira Ramadan, a lawyer who joined the Lib Dems in May.“People are fed up of Raab. Our activists are hearing voters are saying they voted Tory all their lives but Dominic Raab doesn’t represent them anymore.”A Conservative Party spokesperson said: “No matter what they say, a vote for the Liberal Democrats would risk putting Corbyn in Downing Street.“A vote for the Liberal Democrats would mean we keep on arguing about Brexit whilst important issues – like the NHS, schools and police – don’t get the attention they deserve.“Only voting for the Conservatives in Esher and Walton will keep our economy strong, meaning we will be able to invest in the people’s priorities and unleash Britain’s potential.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

win a parliamentary majority at Thursday’s general election, according to a major new poll – but their predicted margin of victory has been halved in the past fortnight.Labour and Liberal Democrat gains have eaten into the Tories’ majority, according to the\u0026nbsppoll of more than 100,000 voters that came closest to predicting the 2017 result.The Conservatives are set to win 339 seats, with Labour on 231, the Lib Dems\u0026nbspon\u0026nbsp15,\u0026nbspthe SNP\u0026nbspon 41, and the Brexit Party empty-handed,\u0026nbspYouGov’s\u0026nbspMRP poll for The Times\u0026nbspforecasts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the level of variation in the poll suggests the Tories could secure as many as 367 seats, or as few as 311, leading YouGov’s\u0026nbspdirector of political research, Anthony Wells, to conclude: “Based on the model we cannot rule out a hung parliament.”The sophisticated polling model uses more than 100,000 voter interviews over a seven-day period, combined with analysis of key demographics, past voting behaviour and other metrics to guess the likelihood of a person voting for a particular party.Created with Sketch.General election: Facts and

intention since the most recent MRP poll on 27 November, which saw the Tories barrelling towards a 68-seat majority and Labour heading for a disastrous 211 seats.YouGov’s MRP poll was alone in correctly forecasting that Theresa May would lose her majority, calculating her party would win 310 seats. This turned out to be just seven short of the reality, with the poll correctly calling the result in 93 per cent of the country.However, in what is arguably the least predictable election in modern history, voter intentions are changing daily, casting some doubt over the week-long snapshot.Expectations of widespread tactical voting are a further hindrance to nationwide polls, with another YouGov\u0026nbspsurvey on Tuesday suggesting one in five voters intend to do so.What the parties are promising on the big issuesHow a photo of a boy sleeping on a hospital floor Hung parliament? Corbyn as PM? Tory win? The five possible scenariosWhich politicians have been the winners and losers on TV?“The margins are extremely tight and small swings in a small number of seats, perhaps from tactical voting and a continuation of Labour’s recent upward trend, means we can’t currently rule out a hung parliament,” said YouGov’s political research manager, Chris Curtis.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“As things currently stand, there are 85 seats with a margin of error of five per cent or less.”If the predicted result materialises, it would hand the PM the largest Tory majority since the Eighties, topping John Major’s 21-seat margin of Commons control in 1992.For Labour, the prediction of winning 231 seats would be its worst result for more than 30 years, according to YouGov.But the result will add to\u0026nbspMr Johnson’s woes as each party\u0026nbspprepares for a final blitz across the country in the final full day of the campaign, with Tory gains from Labour reduced from 44 to 29 since the MRP poll a fortnight ago.Labour appear to be “patching the cracks” in its so-called “red wall” of seats across the north and the midlands, YouGov said, but the Tories are still predicted to commandeer seats such as Don Valley, Bishop Auckland, Wrexham and Great Grimsby.The party leaders will on Wednesday issue\u0026nbsptheir eve-of-poll messages to voters in a last-minute bid to shore up their support. Speaking at a rally in Middlesbrough,\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is expected to ask the electorate to “save the NHS”.“My message to all those voters who are still undecided is that you can vote for hope in this election. It’s time for a pay rise for 12 million people, for lower fares and bills and for free childcare,” he is expected to say.“You can vote for a Labour government that will be on your side. A Labour government that will save our NHS.”JCB at factory in StaffordshireThe party has also released figures that it says show five more years of Tory government will push health service waiting lists up to 5.8 million by the end of 2024, up from 4.4 million in 2019. The figure was 2.5 million when the Tories took office in 2010.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the stats, drawn from official data, illustrate a “Tory demolition of our NHS”.But on Tuesday Boris Johnson\u0026nbsphammered home his party’s own simple message, telling voters that “the stalemate in parliament has held this country back for too long”.“Instead of concentrating on your priorities, Westminster has been mired in ision and deadlock,” he said.“Politicians have spent so much time shouting at each other and devising ways of wriggling out of Brexit that they have neglected the issues people care about,” he said during a speech in Staffordshire\u0026nbspwhere he brought to reality the symbolism of his statement: “It’s time to send in the bulldozers and smash through the gridlock.”Corbyn will appoint Brexit negotiators backing ‘both Leave and Remain’Terror victim’s father insists PM has not given condolences to familyI wish Boris Johnson could sit in my GP’s chairThe Lib Dems will also be on familiar political terrain for the last full day of campaigning. Jo Swinson, who will be visiting a string of Tory-held target seats in Esher and Walton, Guildford and Wimbledon, will tell voters: “My message today is clear. To stop Brexit, we must stop Boris Johnson. We have one more day left to do it.“To all my fellow Lib Dem activists up and down the country,\u0026nbspI say this: keep going. Keep fighting for every vote. And to everyone out there who has a growing pile of Lib Dem leaflets on their kitchen table: we can win where you live.”She is expected to say that Mr Johnson had “showed us the kind of leader he is going to be” when he refused to acknowledge a photo of a sick child forced to sleep on the floor of an understaffed NHS hospital.\u0026nbspAhead of her visit to Esher and Walton, Lib Dems released a dossier of comments from Dominic Raab to bolster their audacious bid to target the foreign secretary’s true-blue seat for what they hope will be one of the most remarkable upsets in modern electoral history.These included Mr Raab’s description of British workers as “among the worst idlers in the world”, his claim that typical food bank users were people with “a cash flow problem”, and his characterisation of some feminists as “obnoxious bigots”.The dossier also pointed to his admission of ignorance of the UK’s reliance on the CalaisDover link and co-authorship of a pamphlet containing calls to break up the “monolith” of the NHS – language also used by the PM as a nascent MP.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said: “Dominic Raab is a right-wing ideologue and has a long and chequered history of insulting the British public. He simply cannot be trusted to represent the people of Esher and Walton or stand up for this country on the global stage.“This Thursday’s general election gives voters the chance to unseat this man for good. Only the Liberal Democrats can take seats off the Conservatives and beat leading Brexiteers like Raab, John Redwood and Jacob Rees-Mogg.”The latest Ipsos MORI poll carried out from 6 to 9 December shows Ms Swinson is now more unpopular than Mr Corbyn, with a -31 per cent popularity rating. Mr Corbyn’s is now -30, up eight percentage points on the previous week, building on previous improvements during the campaign.\u0026nbspBoth leaders, however, trail Mr Johnson, who is rated -14. But the survey was largely conducted before Monday, when the prime minister was strongly criticised for his response to the photo of a sick child sleeping on the floor of a hospital.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But beyond the seemingly endless campaign gimmicks, soundbite interviews and scripted appearances, there are real policies at stake that will affect the country we live in for years to come. Here, we run through key issues that have seen less of the limelight in the build-up to Thursday’s vote, telling you what each of the three major parties is pledging – and what we think about it.Tories:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA “triple lock” on taxes, with no increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT for five years. Boost public sector investment up to 3 per cent of GDP but rethink if debt interest hits 6 per cent of revenue.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLabour: Public spending boost of £83bn, with rises in corporation tax, capital gains tax and income tax for the highest earners to fund it. Nationalisation of rail, mail, water and the big six energy firms, as well as the broadband arm of BT.Lib Dems: A “mechanism” that lets the public share profits of tech firms, plus a tax on frequent fliers, while cannabis use would be legalised and taxed. Corporation tax would be restored to 20 per cent, but the marriage tax allowance would be scrapped.Is Labour’s policy of planting 2bn trees by 2040 realistic?Our view:\u0026nbspPain and short- to medium-term economic damage from Brexit will be substantial, and restrict the ability to boost public spending, cut taxes or reduce the national debt. The terms of a new trade deal with the EU, let alone any with other major nations, are unknown – and therefore so are the nation’s future prospects. Tories promise to “unleash Britain’s potential”, presumably by making the economy more competitive via “supply side” reforms, while Labour’s huge fiscal stimulus would raise the rate of growth in the economy, but experts say\u0026nbspto only a relatively modest extent. The Liberal Democrats have enjoyed the most favourable reviews from independent think tanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Tories: Ensure universal credit “works for the most vulnerable”, but end the benefit freeze and bring in tough punishments for those who cheat the system. £1bn for extra childcare places before and after school, and during holidays.Labour:\u0026nbspScrap universal credit, the benefit cap and the two-child policy, while bringing in a pilot of universal basic income. £58bn for the “Waspi women” affected by state pension age changes.Lib\u0026nbspDems: Reform universal credit, reducing the wait for first payments from five weeks to five days. Introduce a legal right to food. Keep the triple lock on the basic state pension while Waspi women would be “properly compensated”.Our view:\u0026nbspUniversal credit is almost universally loathed, and its shortcomings have been well-advertised. Even in its primary goal of reducing the cost to the taxpayer the new system has failed – and it is yet to be fully rolled out nationally. The problem, as the Commons Public Accounts Committee has pointed out, is that scrapping universal credit at this late stage in its development and returning to either the old system or yet another new system would cost more than persisting. In other words, UC may be the least bad option for the public finances. \u0026nbspClimate and environmentThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailTories: Cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, spending £9.2bn to improve the energy efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals – with £6.3bn installing energy-saving measures to cut bills in 2.2 million homes.\u0026nbspLabour: Aim to “achieve the substantial majority” of emissions reductions by 2030, but no pledge to cut out greenhouse gases by that date.Lib\u0026nbspDems: With a net-zero target to 2045, the Lib Dems will insulate all of the UK’s homes by 2030, ensuring 80 per cent of electricity comes from renewable sources by 2030 and planting 60 million trees a year. Ban on fracking and non-recyclable single-use plastics, with all cars electric by 2030.The key seats that will decide the general electionIs Nicola Sturgeon the key to a second Brexit referendum?Our view:\u0026nbspIn their ways, all the parties’ promises to make the UK carbon-neutral are ambitious. Even the Tories’ would cost £1 trillion. The problem, of course, with any of these plans is public resistance to moving out of conventional cars, scrapping gas boiler central heating, and taking fewer flights. The parties are also unclear about whether these targets account for offshoring our pollution to China and elsewhere.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspTories: £14bn for schools, and programmes to deal with bullying and disruption.Labour: Charitable status removed from independent schools, 30 hours of free childcare for pre-school children and a Sure Start centre in every community. Scrap university tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.Lib\u0026nbspDems: £13.9bn a year on early years, including boosts for children’s centres and free childcare for 2-4-year-olds, as well as those aged nine months and over whose parents work full-time. An extra £10.6bn a year on schools, including 20,000 more teachers, and £10,000 skills wallet for adults to invest in training.Our view:\u0026nbspEducation, education, education was once the chant, and, under new management, Labour has the edge on radicalism. In economic terms, encouraging higher education should improve skills and therefore the underlying performance of the economy. The question is how much of the cost should be paid by the inidual and what should be accounted for by the state. On schools, after years in which they were prioritised by New Labour, then partly ring-fenced from austerity, the state of British school is not as dire as its times portrayed, which may be one reason why the issue has subsided in importance.\u0026nbspTories: New social housing white paper and a pledge to renew the affordable homes programme.Labour: Pledge to build 100,000 homes for social rent each year. Some 8,000 homes available for people with a history of homelessness, and £1bn a year for councils’ homelessness services.Lib\u0026nbspDems: Build 300,000 homes a year, including 100,000 for social rent. Government-backed tenancy deposits for private renters under 30. Council-tax hikes on properties left empty for more than six months.Our view:\u0026nbspIf tougher regulation and a larger role for the state is the solution to the housing crisis, then the Labour Party has all the answers. The obvious retort to that is that measures such as rent control have been tried and sometimes led to perverse consequences. In terms of supply, there is some agreement – Labour and the Liberal Democrats and committed to building, but the Tories promise only a white paper.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.General election:

NHS Visa for qualified doctors and nurses. Freedom of movement will end.Labour: Numerical targets scrapped along with the 2014 Immigration Act. Pledge to dismantle the “hostile environment” that led to the Windrush scandal, while free movement will be subject to Brexit negotiations.Lib\u0026nbspDems: Stop Brexit and retain freedom of movement. End hostile environment. Resettle 10,000 refugees a year, and a further 10,000 refugee children over the next decade.Our view:\u0026nbspAll the main parties refuse to say whether immigration will be higher or lower than it is now, whether Brexit happens or not. There is much talk of “control” and, in different ways, they all stress that migration should match the needs of the economy, but beyond broad principles there is little specific – because immigration remains so explosive.\u0026nbspTories: £1 billion in extra funding every year, while building “a cross-party consensus” to find a long-term solution, on the condition that any reform must ensure nobody needing care would be forced to sell their home to pay for it.Labour: A comprehensive National Care Service for England. Under a lifetime cap on personal contributions, no one would be required to face costs of more than £100,000 for care in old age.Lib\u0026nbspDems:\u0026nbspRaise £7bn a year with a 1p in the pound rise in the basic, higher and additional rates of income tax for health and social care.\u0026nbspOur view:\u0026nbspAll parties agree there is a crisis none has an actual plan. Despite promising such a scheme, Boris Johnson has conceded the plan is not fully worked through. Labour and the Liberal Dems talk in more detail, but again a few paragraphs in a manifesto do not constitute a plan.\u0026nbspCrime and justiceTories: Recruit 20,000 police officers over the next three years to replace those lost due to budget cuts since 2010. Consult on toughening laws for attacks on emergency service workers and boost the number of Tasers and body cameras available for police.Labour: Re-establish neighbourhood policing and recruit 2,000 more frontline officers than the Conservatives. Establish a royal commission to develop a public health approach to drugs. Review the Prevent programme. Eliminate institutional bias against black and ethnic minority groups.Lib Dems: Invest £1bn in community policing and take a public health approach on violence. An extra 2,000 prison officers to help make prisons “places of rehabilitation”. Pledge for an immediate 2 per cent pay rise for police officers.Our view:\u0026nbspEvery political party promises to reduce crime, but few governments succeed in doing so. The extra police promised by all, plus the restoration of cuts to the criminal justice system (such as the courts and probation service) offered by the opposition parties might well improve matters. However, crime levels are also linked to social conditions and the wider state of the economy. Thus, as new Labour used to say, political parties need to be tough on crime, but also tough the causes of crime.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

After rejecting Theresa May’s deal (too soft), then Boris Johnson’s deal (hard, but with an unacceptable Irish Sea border), they returned to Belfast, with their tails between their legs.In this election, again they’re asking voters to give them a mandate to go and influence the Westminster government - without so much as a hint of irony. The truth is they won’t be hugely punished.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPolitics in Northern Ireland remains deeply tribal, and many unionists will still back their biggest party for fear of splitting the vote\u0026nbspand handing a victory to what they see as the other side. The DUP are also attempting to distance themselves from Boris Johnson’s betrayal over the unpopular Brexit deal.So while Sinn Fein will take a fistful of seats along the border, the DUP will still\u0026nbspromp home in many of its safe constituencies.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75But in some seats, Remainers are giving them a run for their money. As many as 60 per cent of voters in Belfast wanted to remain in the EU, yet aside from Sinn Fein in West Belfast, the other three seats in the city are held by the DUP. This week, the pro-Remain parties of Northern Ireland hope to change that.For 20 years, North Belfast has been the seat of Nigel Dodds, DUP grandee and their leader at Westminster. He is being challenged here by Sinn Fein’s John Finucane - the current Lord Mayor of Belfast and the son of solicitor Pat, who was murdered by loyalist gunmen in his\u0026nbspfamily home in 1989.\u0026nbsp“I grew up in North Belfast and it was pretty much as safe a unionist seat as you could get,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbsp“But I think that’s different now because society has moved on, and there’s a regressive brand of politics that they want to leave behind. People want to remove those very loud Brexiteer voices who are not representative.”Mr Dodds has a majority of 2,081, but with the SDLP and Greens not running against Sinn Fein, this seat is in a virtual dead heat. Mr Finucane is working hard to win over people who wouldn’t normally vote for his party. As Irish republicans, Sinn Fein abstain from taking their seats in the House of Commons (seven at the last election), but he believes this position has never been easier to justify, given the chaos that has played out at Westminster.“The Brexit project is very much an English nationalist project, and they’re entitled to have that,” he explains. “There is a momentum that will be forcing this through no matter how much damage it will cause here in Belfast or across Northern Ireland.“For those who backed Remain, or have come around to backing Remain since 2016, protection for them has come from Dublin, Brussels, Washington DC, and protection is never going to come from the green benches of Westminster.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Finucane describes Mr Dodds as the arch-Brexiteer\u0026nbspof Northern Ireland, having been part of the Vote Leave campaign. “People see this as a real opportunity to send a powerful message beyond Belfast that we rejected, and continue to reject, Brexit.”What does the Sinn Fein-SDLP electoral pact in mean for Brexit?In South Belfast, the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly (with a majority of 1,996) is under threat from a nationalist who would take up her seat in Westminster. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna says people are feeling “disenfranchised and unheard” in the Brexit debate, and she wants to change that.“There are some crazy things being said in Westminster about Ireland and Brexit, and there’s nobody there to correct them,” she says. “There are many people who may have voted Sinn Fein in the past, but who now see a situation where we have votes coming down to a handful of MPs, and that protecting Ireland’s interests should come ahead of party ideology.”Indeed both Sinn Fein and the Greens have stood aside in this seat to aide Ms Hanna’s fight against the DUP, who she says have left Northern Ireland in an “unequivocally worse position” than when they entered the confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservatives in 2017.“They had an incredible amount of power and influence, and they had the opportunity to use it to positive effect for people in Northern Ireland and they chose not to.”\u0026nbspThe DUP have dug themselves into a Brexit-shaped hole, first by backing it in spite of the ever-increasing Remain consensus\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland, then by rejecting Theresa May’s deal in favour of a harder one, then by rejecting Boris Johnson’s harder deal once they saw it would be damaging to the union.“They have yet to articulate a form of Brexit that matches both their red lines and the red lines of the people who live here and don’t want a hard border,” says Ms Hanna. “Perhaps it’s dawning on them that you can have a hard Brexit or you can have the union but you can’t have both.”Arguably the SDLP’s strongest asset, Ms Hanna - a Stormont MLA who has even been endorsed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar - looks poised to take this seat and ensure her party’s return to Westminster. Nevertheless, she is well aware that Northern Ireland MPs cannot reroute Brexit alone.“We’ve got to roll with the punches in terms of what is on the table after the election,” she admits. “If there happens to be a majority of parties other than the Conservatives, then a People’s Vote is our preferred next step.”But it’s not just nationalists like Sinn Fein and the SDLP who are lining up to take on the DUP - this extends to all the pro-Remain parties, including the Alliance Party. Neither nationalist nor unionist, Alliance is a centre-ground party, increasingly representative of the other\u0026nbspconstituency in Northern Ireland, who are not committed either way on the constitutional question.The slow but steady growth of Alliance was evident in local council elections earlier this year, as well as the election of party leader Naomi Long as one of the region’s three MEPs. She is taking on the DUP’s Gavin Robinson in East Belfast (with a majority of 8,474), a seat which she previously held from 2010 to 2015, because she says the unionist party is pursuing an agenda which is not supported in the constituency.“What we’ve had from the DUP is a very extreme Brexit stance,” says Ms Long, pointing out that the party has lurched to the right as the process has gone on. “Even some of those in East Belfast who would have voted Leave feel they’re not being listened to at Westminster.”While nationalists and Others\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland have largely backed Remain, a Lucid Talk poll released in recent days showed that only 38 per cent of unionists now back Leave, with 41 per cent in favour of Remain. Support for Boris Johnson’s deal is in single digits across all communities. And it seems the DUP have already got the message. Brexit doesn’t feature at all in the party’s election broadcast, campaign literature, or their official website. Ms Long says this “speaks volumes about how wrong they have got this, and how little they want to be held to account for their decision.”Alliance must draw cross-party support to take East Belfast, but the party is not in favour of pacts. So while Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Greens have stood aside to give Ms Long a clear run here, Alliance have not exactly returned the favour. In fact, they are the only party running in all 18 of Northern Ireland’s constituencies - and with a 50-50 gender quota at that.\u0026nbsp“We are standing to be MPs for five years, and our manifesto is broader than just Brexit,” says Ms Long. “So I think it’s important that we stand and give people that choice.”Like the SDLP, Alliance are in favour of a second referendum - with Remain on the ballot. While this stance has been criticised as one which ignores the wishes of Leave voters, Ms Long argues that’s not the case.“I’ve never patronised people who voted Leave,” she says, “but what they were promised in 2016 was a kind of unicorn Brexit which would be all things to all people, and what we’re now getting is a lame donkey Brexit under Boris Johnson, and I think given that choice, some people may decide that they would prefer to keep things as they are.A seat-by-seat guide to the general election in Northern Ireland“They should have the opportunity to change their mind just as the prime minister himself has done on numerous occasions on this issue.”As election day approaches, it seems likely that the SDLP will take South Belfast, although it will be a harder fight for Alliance in East Belfast. But if there’s only one Northern Ireland seat to keep your eye on, it’s Dodds v Finucane in North Belfast. A win for Sinn Fein here would be a major victory, and its loss would be devastating for the DUP.As with so many seats across the UK, the success of pro-Remain candidates in Northern Ireland will lie entirely in people’s willingness to vote tactically to send a message to the DUP, and elect more voices who will reflect the pro-EU majority.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Corbyn would bankrupt the nation. Corbyn despises this country. Corbyn has spent a career licking the boots of terrorists. Corbyn never met a hate preacher he didn’t like.If Jeremy Corbyn gets elected on Thursday then, in the words of The Carpenters, it will be yesterday once more — and ato the ravages of gormless Socialism, red in tooth and claw, unseen since the Seventies.We have forgotten what mass unemployment is like in this country. We have forgotten what soaring inflation is like. We have forgotten what it is like to endure endless strikes. Corbyn would bring it all back — and worse.For Jeremy Corbyn has no love for this country. He has no affection for our people, our history or our flag.Personally, I couldn’t give a flying figCorbyn watches the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day.But it does bother me that he always takes the side of this country’s enemies.It concerns me that his “friends” include terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA. It disturbs me like hell that Corbyn can even find excuses for Russian thugs conducting their murderous business on British soil.Jeremy Corbyn despises the nation he seeks to lead. And that scares me most of all.Thursday will dawn cold, dark and with the possibility of snow. This close to Christmas, nobody feels like going to a polling booth. But this close to a terrorist-sympathising Marxist moron seizing power, we can’t afford NOT to vote.There are real problems that the incoming government will need to address on day one.Yes, our departure from the European Union is absolutely crucial. But no matter how much we may despise the unelected fat cats in Brussels, the nations of Europe will always be our neighbours and should always be our friends.Leaving the EU while maintaining good trading relations with it is no easy day at the office.And the new PM will have far more than Brexit to deal with. The housing crisis has made owning your own home an impossible dream for the younger generation.The pressures on our schools, roads and NHS are at breaking point. The working man and woman pay too much tax. Serious crime is rising. Climate change is real.All this is waiting in our new Prime Minister’s inbox.Jeremy Corbyn — a stupid, tenth-rate little man with stale, left-wing clichés where his brain should be — is clearly not up to the job.He is an economic cretin who would empty your pockets. He is a spineless hypocrite on Brexit. He has enabled racism to enter the bloodstream of the Labour Party. And he hates the wicked West.“What goes around comes around,” Corbyn sneered when almost , people were murdered on  .Every time there is a terrorist attack, Corbyn finds a way of saying that we had it coming.On Thursday, YOUR vote can keep the worthless old git and his deranged supporters from power.This country deserves better than Jeremy Corbyn.THE Pirelli Calendar was once the byword for lavishly shot sexiness, but it is struggling to find its role in the modern world.Pretentious pictures of Emma Watson as a po-faced nun are probably not the answer to the Italian firm’s dilemma.Next year Pirelli should just print pictures of tyres.It has to be more interesting than this pompous cobblers.HARDCORE James Bond fans have long feared that an increasingly politically correct  was becoming licensed to kill joy.Bond had started coming over all woke. Daniel Craig never needs much encouragement to moan about Bond’s old-fashioned, sexist ways, while sources have claimed that the term “Bond girls” is now banned on  film sets as it is deemed unacceptable in the modern era.All very worthy. And all light years away from the gritty, sexy essence of Ian Fleming’s iconic hero.But the good news is that the trailer for the new Bond movie, No Time To Die, dropped this week and it looks exactly like a  blockbuster should look.Evil villains dreaming of world domination. Fast cars and fast women. Fiendishly clever gadgets. Car chases that would get you nine points on your licence.AndAna de Arma is not the ultimate Bond girl, then my name is Pussy Galore.WHEN I was a child, my family would make a -mile round trip just to gawp at the Christmas wonders of London.The lights of the West End. Santa’s grotto in Selfridges.And the giant Christmas tree given to us every year since  by the nation of Norway, grateful to us for chasing out the Nazis.This year the tree in Trafalgar Square is, frankly, a bit of a disappointment.Did the Norwegians forget to water it That’s not a giant Christmas tree.It’s a big twig.I’m not sure I would go to the end of the garden to see it, let alone drive all the way from Billericay.THE Duchess of Cambridge is such a great ambassador for the Royal Family.In these dficult days, with Prince Andrew all sweaty and Prince Harry all sulky, the glorious Kate never puts a foot wrong.Look at her helping out at a charity for disadvantaged kids on a Christmas tree farm in Great Missenden, Bucks.Sometimes I think that, after the Queen has gone, there is no future for the monarchy in modern Britain.But then I look at Kate – always smiling, always gracious – and I change my mind.WHEN BBC-approved comedian Nish Kumar appeared at The Lord’s Taverners Christmas Lunch he was booed off stage and narrowly dodged a bread roll.Nish made the mistake of trotting out lame anti-Brexit quips that would have had the canned laughter turned up to ten on any BBC  show.This material doesn’t work so well in the real world.The Lord’s Taverners is a cricket charity that supports children living in poverty or with disability. A very good cause.But the audience at their Christmas beano had no appetite for jokes about evil Tories. Although jokes about evil Tories will get your contract renewed at the BBC.Nish, the host of The Mash Report – me neither – told the audience: “I should have known this would happen when I agreed to do a set in front of people who colonised my ancestors.”Desperate stuff, Nish.I very much doubtanyone at that charity lunch colonised anyone’s ancestors.One of these BBC-approved comics should do a stand-up routine on Diane Abbott’s mathematics.Or the Labour Party’s inability to elect a woman leader in  years.This is all worthy of biting satire!But then they would never be asked back on Mock The Week, or The Mash Report nor any of the Beeb’s dreary, joyless, biased crap.Nish Kumar’s humiliation in the real world begs the question: Why should we all pay the BBC £. a year for a licence fee when it only represents the views of some of us Kumar – and all of these BBC-approved comedians – should stay in Broadcasting House.They will be safe there – Nish, Dara O Briain, Sandi Toksvig, Jo Brand and all the rest.They should never go into the real world.Someone might chuck a bread roll at them.PRINCE WILLIAM says he “recycles as much as he can”.Any chance of leaving his beleaguered uncle, the Duke of York, out for the bin men If Andrew is as innocent as he claims in his dealings with child-abusing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, then he should go to the United States and do whatever it takes to clear his name.Until he does so, the former Randy Andy is an embarrassment to his family.And his country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we are also their role models in terms of food choices. If we breakfast on Pringles, pizza and doughnuts then the odds are they will too.By the same token,we start the day with porridge, seeds and fruit, they’ll likely grow up assuming that’s the best way.School is a huge influence, too, and it is great Jamie did succeed. In fact, he started a nationwide trend of schools providing and promoting a healthy diet.But some schools are taking it too far. At one primary I know of, teachers and dinner ladies patrol the lunchtime tables hunting out contraband such as sugary drinks and chocolate, to confiscate it then attempt to shame the parents into submission with letters about their snack misdemeanours.Other schools, it has emerged, are taking it even further than that, with pupils being followed when school has ended.Yes, following them from the school gates to the high street to intervenethey are seen going into a takeaway.Children at Cotham School, in Bristol, have been told they are not allowed to enter at least three convenience stores and a takeaway between .pm and .pm.Not only that, but school staff acting as bouncers have been patrolling the shopping parade and standing in high-vis jackets outside the chippy.The school says it is using powers given by Michael Gove’s  Education Act, which allows it to rule over the conduct of pupils in certain circumstances outside the school gates.The school’s business manager, Allison Crossland, said teachers have the authority over what the pupils do even after the end of the school day.And they are doing so to, “ensure the safety of children on their way home from school”.According to one takeaway owner, teachers went inside and started giving out detentions to children they found in there, although the school denies this.But the takeaway shops on the street say they have seen a drop in business since Cotham School staff started patrolling the streets and, unsurprisingly, they are up in arms as a result.I’m not saying it’s great for kids to snack on high-fat or sugary food when they leave school. Of course it’s not.But is it really the responsibility of their teachers to make sure they don’t  Is it right teachers can rule on what your kids eat when they leave school I don’t think so. AndI was a parent of a child being told what to eat by someone other than me, I’d be furious.I know some people will say this comes down to money, that it’s more expensive to eat healthily.And yes, it is cheaper and easier to snack on sugary foods such as chips and biscuits.Some might say that school dinners are not satisfying enough.Parents need to take it upon themselves to learn about how to cook and eat healthily.You don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well. Look at Jack Monroe, who has written a book on how to cook well with tinned food.There is no doubt something needs to change when it comes to kids and food.The number of obese people in the UK has almost doubled in  years. Rather than paying staff to patrol the chippy, I would vote to bring back domestic science and teach all children how to cook properly from scratch.But as parents, it is our duty, and no one ’s, to look after our children and teach them how to eat well.I KNOW they were doing important work at the Nato summit and all . . . But bloody hell, it was easy for the onlooker to be distracted, wasn’t it, with all the world leaders’ power-mongering going on First of all there were the handshakes. The amount of one-upmanship that can occur in a simple greeting is staggering: Who gets to overpower who by making sure their hand is firmly on top throughout the shake.Who lets go and de-shakes first, and who insists on prolonging the handshake so enthusiastically that it is impossible for the other party to get away until the prolonger is good and ready.Donald Trump famously shakes LONG and HARD. I think it is called the Power Shake and is often employed by people who think the harder they squeeze, the more important and manly they are.They hold on to show they have control over you. But at this summit, Trump possibly met his match with Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was repeatedly filmed gripping people’s hands so hard that both sets of knuckles were going white.Mind you, that is better than the limp shake. No one likes nor trusts someone with a limp handshake. It’s like shaking hands with a person with no bones.But my least favourite is the sweaty-palm shake.And then there was the footage of Trudeau, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson apparently gossiping about Trump like a bunch of naughty schoolboys.Where’s the leadership qualities in behaving like that It all left me feeling like they need to grow up.And then I saw the photo of our magnicent Queen and all  Nato allies. Guess how many women were in the group  I counted seven, including the Queen. I can’t help but thinkthere were more women involved, less of this childish stuff would go on.But it comes with at least one benefit: An utterly fabulous clothing budget!I have never seen Melania in the same outfit twice .She wore a coat a few months ago which I quite liked the look of, so I thought I might buy it.I looked it up online and it was £,, for something made out of wool. I passed! Mind you, whatever the cost, she looks great and oozes class.I SHUDDERED when I read the story of Jayney Nascimento, , who borrowed £, from her mother for liposuction in the hope of having skinnier legs. But instead of getting the legs of her dreams, she contracted a deadly flesh-eating bug called necrotising fasciitis, which left her fighting for her le and she almost had her legs amputated.Jayney, an administrator from Shropshire, says: “I paid for an expensive cosmetic procedure so I would feel comfortable showing off my legs.“Instead, I nearly lost them and I hate them more now than I did before the operation.”Talk about a sobering reminder that all cosmetic surgery is invasive and has potentially le-threatening side-effects. Is it really worth it I’m guessing this woman would say no.CHRISTIE Brinkley was photographed looking absolutely spectacular at an event in New York. Wearing this black, trenchcoat-style mini- dress, with bedazzling purse and sparkly calf boots she seemed about half her age, which is, incredibly, .If I have half of her joie de vivre and charisma at that age, I will be over the moon.And so should she be.POOR Rhodri Giggs, who told this week about the devastating effect brother Ryan’s affair with his we has had on the family. Quite understandably, he hasn’t spoken to footballer Ryan, , in eight years, since the affair with Rhodri’s we Natasha was revealed.But shockingly, he said his mother Lynne hasn’t spoken to him in the past eight years.Rhodri, , says she has taken Ryan’s side: “Because I haven’t got  medals, I haven’t played for Manchester United for -odd years and own a big house.”Turns out this was a triple betrayal. His we. His brother. His mother. Your entire support network gone overnight. Shame on his motherthat is true.DID anyone  wince over Jeremy Corbyn vowing to confront Donald Trump at this week’s Buckingham Palace reception It was about the sanctity of the NHS, which Trump does not appear to be interested in having anything to do with anyway.In the end, Corbyn didn’t get a chance as he was kept firmly away from the US President, possibly after publicly announcing his intentions.But the US is our main ally and it’s quite shocking that on a visit by the President, the opposition leader has to be kept away from Trump because he can’t be trusted to act with respect.What a calamity it would behe became the leader on December .JUST when I thought my admiration for black cab drivers had reached a peak, I got an invitation to a Christmas lunch organised by the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans.They offered Christmas lunch – turkey and all the trimmings – to  veterans who were taken to the venue by a fleet of black cabs driven by volunteer cabbies.It is so heart-warming that it actually brought a tear to my eye.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner. Proof he really hasn’t been paying attention to his Mash Report audience.If he had, Nish would’ve noticed they’re not laughing, they’re applauding in furious agreement about just how much they also hate the Tories, Boris, Trump and Brexit.Those of us who don’t share any of these left-wing prejudices, of course, are just meant to sit and meekly accept the abuse and the fact that all the least funny, most obnoxious and radioactively smug people on TV suddenly seem to have decided they’re the nation’s new moral compass and we’re racist bigots.What’s brilliant about the Lord’s Taverners story and accompanying internet footage of the audience is they refuse to play ball. At the point the clip kicks in, Nish has already lost them and is, as always, playing the race card.Half the crowd are booing, the other half are begging him to say something funny, ashe might suddenly turn into Robin Williams.A great comedian could still have turned it round and adjusted their material, of course.But Nish Kumar is neither great nor even a comedian. He’s a left-wing propagandist who cannotoutside of the tiny BBC Channel  echo chamber, so he has to be ushered off stage by the tombola bloke in red livery.It could’ve happened to any one of a number of C BBC “comedians”, obviously. The Tez O’Clock Show, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order are all just as biased and unpleasant as The Mash Report.Nish is by far the smuggest offender, though, andthe BBC is ever going to make a mass audience laugh again, instead of just lecturing us, it needs to learn the Lord’s Taverners lesson and carve these words on a comedy gravestone: “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish Kumar.

the PM even ditched cuts for higher paid in order to fund it.Boris promised he would freeze income tax, VAT and National Insurance for the next five years, as well as cut NI for the Brits earning the least.The promised tax cuts will save  million people £ next year, the Tories claim.And the PM recently hinted he would also scrap the hated TV licence, so families could save even more on their costs.On issues that are traditionally the most important to working class voters, Boris comes out on top, polls have shown.Almost half of Brits think the current government is tackling unemployment totally well, and  per cent of people think a Tory government led by Boris will provide more jobs.On who Brits think will keep prices down, the Conservatives have a nine point lead against the Labour party.Ms Ainsley, who has written a report on low-income voters being locked out of political debate, warned the Tories that they would need to deliver the promises they had made in order to keep the support of the working class.She added:have seen parties make promises before and they havent seen fundamental change in their communities.Many of their communities feel worse off than they did before so all politicians are going to have to deliver.Former Work and Pensions Secretary and Conservative candidate for Tatton, Esther McVey, said the modern incarnation of the Labour party has become too detached from the working class.She told The Sun Online: Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnells Labour is nothing at all like the Labourgrew up with.They wouldnt understand the concerns of a Labour voterthey fell over one in the street, she said.People understand sounds too good to be true, it iniably is,people are doing a four day week they know it ultimately cant work out like that. is detached from reality.They are a metropolitan elite that is just detached from the day-to-day le of regular working people.They are not talking about things which resonate or relate or ordinary people.Working class voters flocked to the Leave campaign in  and made up a huge  per cent of the vote to leave the EU.Those who voted to Leave have been left disillusioned by Jeremy Corbyns ambiguous neutral stance on Brexit and promises for a second referendum.Mr Corbyns recent Brexit position comes after years of wavering and failing to articulate a clear point on one of the biggest issues facing the UK.It has gone down appallingly with working class voters, predominately in traditional Labour heartlands, who have turned now turned their backs on the Labour party.Even Unite boss Len McCluskey, a Corbyn supporter, warned he was losing working class support after a poll of , Labour members showed the parties failure to back Brexit was hitting them hard in the Midlands and North of the country.The crash in support for Labour - and the Tories after failing to get Brexit done in March - led to huge wins for the Brexit party in the European elections earlier this year.As Boris continues to fight for his pledge to get Brexit done, Tory insiders are confident that left behind Labour voters will turn to the Conservatives.While Mr Corbyn has been campaigning for the many, not the few, his party has become dominated by posh career politicians who are out of touch with the working class.Academics at UCL released a report into the decline of working class Labour MPs: in the s seven out of  came from working class backgrounds, now that number is only one in .The lack of real world experience has alienated the voters the Labour party claim to champion.Retiring Labour MP Gloria de Piera warned her party is in the midst of a war for its soul and must reconnect with what was once the workers party.When voting intention is categorised by education level, the Labour party haemorrhage even more votes.In   per cent of people with GCSEs or below voted for Labour, as few as  per cent of equivalent voters intend to cast ballots for Mr Corbyns big spending party on Thursday.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A decent majority will liberate him to secure Brexit by January .But Boris also has a zeal to radically improve Sun readers’ lives — and we would hold him to it.His rival for PM, Marxist Jeremy Corbyn, was yesterday branded a danger to national security by one of his OWN senior front-benchers, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. A Boris victory would kill off that threat for ever.He would then be able to pour £billion extra into the NHS, hire , more cops to hammer crime, inject substantial new funding into schools and green-light multi-billion-pound, job-creating infrastructure projects.Plus, Boris will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT for five years.No sane politician can or should compete with the absurd freebies Corbyn claims he could dole out. Labour’s entire plan is a vast, ruinous fantasy, relying solely on the better-off sticking around to be hammered again and again for extra tax. The truth is everyone would pay for Marxist revolution.Boris, by contrast, would not bankrupt Britain. Nor wage war on private companies, as Corbyn would, and scare off investors, causing mass job losses.And, crucially, he tends to achieve what he sets out to. He ran for Mayor in Labour-dominated London and won twice. He led the Leave campaign to victory against the Remainer establishment. He was written off as a futureTory leader but won that too. He doggedly pursued, and won, the new Brexit deal every know-all said was impossible.Boris is being subjected to a tsunami of hate from Corbyn’s thugs and diehard Remainers who know he is Brexit’s last hope. Almost all of it is confected cobblers. Boris is as liberal as any of them.He is nothing like their hard-right caricature and they know it. Had he backed Remain they would love him.Boris is the right man to lead Britain into the s. And the alternative, as Corbyn’s own front-benchers privately admit, is too horric to think about.Vote Tory tomorrow.HEARING Corbyn branded a national security risk by one of his most senior frontbenchers is almost too much to grasp.Jon Ashworth, shadow health secretary, believes that his own leader is a danger to Britain. ThatCorbyn becomes PM on Friday the civil service will need to act rapidly to keep us all safe.The Sun has long considered Corbyn an unprecedented threat to our country. He is far closer to terrorists like Hamas than our No ally, America, which he detests. Our security partners would not trust him with classied information.But this taped confession tells us much about those around him too.In public Ashworth is a loyal Corbynista. In private he says Corbyn is a security threat and a loser who blocked Brexit. He longs to replace him with someone “half-decent”.He and his allies know their leader to be useless. Worse, they are beseeching voters to hand power to an extremist they know endangers every one of us.How can they look themselves in the mirror Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But here there is nowhere to go.“We are all on top of one another.“No one is giving us straight answer. I just want an answer.”The couple added the conservatory to their council home and made changes in the loft without permission from building control or housing, the council has said.But Solly claims he was given the go-ahead for the conservatory and insists the only works he carried out in the loft were to put plywood flooring down and plasterboard on the sides.They were booted out of their home of  years as a result of a prohibition order in response to a “category  hazard”.Solly said: I know we shouldn’t have, but I did it to make the family more comfortable. It was there four – five years.“Then the council came round to do an inspection, looked in the loft and told us we weren’t meant to have a bedroom in the loft.“But there are ten of us in a three bedroom house. We needed extra space. I didn’t do it out of maliciousness. I did it to house our family.”The council said by removing and cutting away at the support joists, the remaining timbers were bearing six times their safe load.And the conservatory was also pulling away from the wall - with the council now planning legal action against the family for estimated costs of £,.They are now hoping to carry out a full structural survey once the couples belongings have been removed from the home.Solly and Donna claim they are unable to claim their possessions as they cant afford a storage facility.A Brentwood Borough Council spokeswoman said: “Initial reports suggest that the timber joists in the roof are no longer in place and the first floor ceilings show cracks.To make the property safe and carry out the survey, it has been necessary for the tenants to vacate the building.We offered to undertake the removal of items on behalf of the tenant, but this has been declined so supervised limited access is being allowed given the condition of the property which is being monitored.“The tenants have been rehomed in temporary accommodation and the council continues to liaise with them.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tell us how much money you are requesting between £, and £,. Please note there are a limited number of larger grants available. The Sun Readers’ Fund , that decides who gets what and how much, will be looking to donate the majority of the £million as small grants to help as many good causes as possible.BY POSTIf you don’t have access to the internet, post your nomination to: Sun Readers’ Fund, The Sun, , London Bridge Street, London SE GF. Lamar, who is on the autistic spectrum, had been overlooked by other potential parents until we ran our story as part of the annual adoption drive to find loving “forever families” for children.Jan says: “We were drawn to Lamar immediately, even though he had challenging behaviour at that point in his le — he had had quite a rough start in le.“The reality is that a lot of these children are lost, they’re hurting and you have to put in a lot of work to get them to a place of being the best versions of themselves.”Tony says: “A child like Lamar can get moved from foster carer to foster carer. But you can break that cycle and give a child a home, and do the best you can.“My thought was, because he has a condition, you can’t just leave him, so that drew us more towards him.”Tony remembers the moving moment when he officially became Lamar’s dad and says: “One of the great joys was the feeling when we had to change all the paperwork into our surname.“The judge called Lamar up and sat him on his knees while the judge was signing the form, then he said, ‘You’re now a Coombs’. That was a fulfilling day.” Lamar has flourished in his adoptive family, he is making strong progress with his schoolwork and is very sporty, particularly enjoying running and rugby.He is also a gted street dancer, who has won numerous competitions and trophies, and hopes to forge a career in modelling.Speaking to The Sun, Lamar comes over as a typical teenage boy — obsessed with sport and, of course, social media. He says: “I like hanging out with friends, going bowling and going to theme parks. I now have almost , followers on Instagram.“Some of my favourite family memories have been of the holidays we have been on, like to Cuba.”Jan and Tony reckon Lamar has come on leaps and bounds and they are both hugely proud of the determination he has shown over the years.Jan says: “He’s doing really well in school, the headteacher has sung his praises.”Two years before Tony first made that excited call to Jan about Lamar, the couple had adopted another child, Shai, again thanks to a newspaper campaign for National Adoption Week.But before adopting, they had never planned to start a family. Jan says: “Believe it or not, I never actually wanted to have children. If it wasn’t for National Adoption Week, we may not have even started. That was the start of the road for us.”As Shai got older, the couple then began to think again about adopting. Janet says: “We would go away on holiday and think, ‘He’s on his own, he’s on the beach with no one to play with — he needs a brother’.“But adopting Lamar took almost a year to complete because we had to go through loads of meetings and .“Social workers had originally thought Lamar would be better off as an only child, because he is very high-energy and had experienced a few problems with a previous foster carer’s son.“But we managed to persuade them that he would be able to live with our family. Lamar finally came home with us in the April of , nine months after we had first seen him in The Sun.”Lamar and Shai have grown close over the years and get on well, but for the occasional tf.Jan says: “Most of the time we all sit at the table and eat together, and that’s when we take the mickey out of each other — or on WhatsApp throughout the day.”Tony adds: “It’s all been joyful. You have the ups and downs, which is normal with children, but on the whole it’s a real joy.”Looking again at that original Sun story, Jan says: “Seeing the picture of Lamar is amazing because he is still like this. He is still very bright and mischievous.” Tony adds: “If I hadn’t seen him in the newspaper, we wouldn’t be where we are today.“It’s only when you look back at things like this, you think, ‘Oh my God, I’m so glad we’ve done it’. It reminds you. It grounds you.“You can take things for granted sometimes when the children are growing up and you go through dferent stages in their le.“But looking back at this article again brings back all those memories. It will be nice to give the article to Lamar when he is older — not to say, ‘Look what we have done’ but just as a way of being appreciative of our le together.”Ever since he was a toddler, Lamar has loved rollercoasters. At first, he got a thrill from just looking at the rides, then as he got older, he has grown braver and the family has travelled to theme parks all over the UK for him.Lamar says: “Going to theme parks with my family are some of my favourite memories of growing up. We have been to Thorpe Park, Blackpool, Drayton Manor, Chessington, Six Flags, all of them.“I remember going to Blackpool — the big red rollercoaster, that’s scary. It makes your tummy feel well weird.”But while Lamar has always loved the ups and downs of a rollercoaster ride, thanks to Jan and Tony his le could not have been more stable. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The billions he is supposedly going to spend on us all without a clue on how he is going to raise them.“Notes to Santa written this month by five-year-olds have more realism about them than his manesto.”The devastating attack comes the day after Labours Jonathan Ashworth was caught saying he didnt think Labour would win the election - and voters cant stand Mr Corbyn.The Shadow Health Secretary was caught on a taped call telling a pal that the “civil service machine” would move “pretty quickly move to safeguard security”Mr Corbyn reaches No.He also said his party’s chances of winning seats in the North were “abysmal” and that he “can’t see” Mr Corbyn getting to No.However, Mr Ashworth later told the BBC that the comments were simply banter between him and a Tory activist friend who had subsequently made him look a plonker.Seizing on the comments today, Mr Johnson said thatBrits vote for anyone other than the Tories: “This country would be led by a Hamas-backing, IRA supporting, anti-Semitism condoning appeaser of the Kremlin - which is what he is, look at the record.“Butyou doubt me, listen to what his health spokesman said today, Jon Ashworth.“He revealed that he thinks his own leader is a security risk and I think it couldnt be clearer than that.”The Tory boss made the comments at a JCB factory in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, after crashing through a Styrofoam brick-wall, with ‘Deadlock emblazoned on it, in a Union Flag digger.The PM blasted the leftie-leader as a “Hamas-backing” IRA supporter as he lept on the humiliating blunder by Mr Ashworth two days before the election. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every vote for Labour brings the Corbyn revolution a step closer.That catastrophe could easily happen this week.In recent opinion polls, the Tories have maintained a consistent lead over Labour by about  per cent - enough for a comfortable majority.But in some surveys, the gap has fallen to just  points, while one poll at the weekend suggested a Conservative majority of just .Moreover, as the last two General Elections proved, the polls can be badly wrong. The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader said he “feels the pain” of millions of people trying to get by and is determined to make the country a fairer place. And he made a heartfelt promise to protect the NHS after our stories about desperate families struggling to get treatment from the struggling health service. In his final interview before polling day, Mr Corbyn revealed what put the fire in his belly as he appealed to undecided voters to back him to be the next Prime Minister. “I feel the pain of the people I represent, the pain of trying to bring up children in a small overcrowded flat, and wanting them to do well and wanting them to achieve at school,” he said. “I think of the people saying theyaposve got three children with quite wide age gap sharing a bedroom, one wants to play music, one wants to do their homework, one wants to play with Lego on the floor. “They just end up fighting for space, then those children donapost achieve what they could at school and their whole le path is damaged because we, the community as a whole, did not provide the housing they need. Itaposs that sort of thing that drives me to change things in our society.” Speaking to the Mirror on Labouraposs battlebus in the North West of England, he added: “Le can be cruel to many people and I want us to have a much fairer society.” Mr Corbyn revealed that his first act on becoming PM would be to allocate emergency funding for more hostel places to help those sleeping on the streets. “Iaposll do something urgently about the rough-sleeping crisis around the country as a symbol of what we are determined to do to end the injustice of the housing crisis,” he said. Labour will also prioritise shoring up the NHS in its first weeks in power – after the Mirror published a series of devastating stories about children struggling to get treatment. “It is an utter disgrace in a civilized world, we can do better. It indicates just how desperate the situation is in our health service,” he said.  But he backed away from personally attacking Boris Johnsonaposs handling of the situation. “I would rather go out there and be positive about what we want to achieve. People can make their own judgements on Boris Johnson when confronted with a picture of a child on the floor of the hospital, compared with the approach that we would take.” He praised his shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth as “absolutely brilliant” despite a leaked conversation in which he predicted they would lose the election as a result of Brexit and Mr Corbynaposs leadership. The Labour leader revealed Mr Ashworth had called him up straight away and was “mortied” and “very upset” that his “banter” had been published. “Heaposs working flat out for a Labour government. I know that and I think heaposs been absolutely brilliant on health and I think we just move on,” Mr Corbyn said. But he acknowledged candidatesapos concerns that Labouraposs Brexit policy was coming up regularly on the doorstep in Leave seats. He admitted that many people were “fed up” with Brexit but that any deal needed to be one that protected people’s livelihoods and security. “Iaposm sure many people are fed up and bored with it,” he said. “Iaposve had as my bottom line that I would prevent a no deal Brexit and would prevent a trade deal with Donald Trump that would sell off our public services.” He admitted it was going to be “dficult” to resolve the issue once and for all but he wanted to try to represent both the % and % as it was the “sensible, grown-up” approach. “I recognise that itaposs going to be dficult. I donapost want to represent just the % or the %, I want to represent the people as a whole”. A Labour government would spend three months negotiating a Leave deal with the EU that wouldnapost destroy industry and then put it – and Remain – to a public confirmatory vote in six months. Its negotiating team would include Brexiteer Labour MPs as well as Remainer ones. “It will be people who have dfering views,” he said. But he admitted his decision not to campaign for either side was “not easy”. He added: “What  could we as a party do to represent people who voted both ways in the referendum  Anything  would be even harder.”  And he warned that under Boris Johnson the risk of a damaging no deal Brexit at the end of  was very high. Mr Corbyn, who has been accused of not being tough enough on security, insisted the first job of any government was to “keep the country safe and secure”. He talked passionately about the welfare of armed forces personnel and cited their pride in missions including rescuing refugees, dealing with the Ebola crisis and UN peacekeeping. “Our armed services are there, yes to protect us against attack, but also there to deal with the insecurities that come from poverty, from environmental disaster and from refugee flows.” Asked whether he could envisage a scenario where he would be prepared to deploy troops for security reasons, he replied: “I would hope we didnapost have to, but of course you have to be prepared to defend society”. Throughout his leadership, Mr Corbyn has faced allegations of not dealing with anti-semitism in party ranks swtly or tough enough. “Antisemitism is utterly evil. Obviously weaposll continue to clamp down on it,” he said. He suggested that Labour could adopt recommendations from the ongoing Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry in full. “Theyaposre only looking at processes and so yes... Weaposd look at it of course. I would imagine we would implement them but theyaposve not made any suggestions yet.” Mr Corbyn was last week accused of being unpatriotic for not watching the Queenaposs Christmas message – but claried that he had watched news bulletins in the morning. “When her Majesty finally gets to make the speech we all know whataposs in it because weaposve seen the trails on it. There was a bit of miscommunication between the interviewer and myself on that. I think weaposre now cool.” He and we Laura Alez, who was sitting next to him on the battle bus, would celebrate Christmas together “hopefully in No , thataposs the idea”. He claimed that “we both” do the cooking but was interrupted by his we who added: “Mainly me”. What was he getting her for Christmas  “A present.” They laughed. “Something nice and something surprising”. But would he have the time to go shopping  “I make time. If you want something done, ask a busy person.” Mr Corbyn claimed he was able to cope with the scale of personal abuse he sometimes faced from the media – but that he worried about his family. “It gets to people around me more than it does me. It is very stressful for family and friends who get very angry on my behalf and feel thereaposs been a lot of unfairness. “I have been active in politics all of my le and I do it because I believe in it. You get personal abuse. Iaposm not replying to it, Iaposm not getting into the gutter with anybody.” He did not criticise Labour candidates for choosing not to put his name or picture on leaflets. “Itaposs up to them what they put on their literature. Nothing bothers me. The only thing that bothers me is winning the election. Itaposs not a Presidential election, itaposs a parliamentary election and Iaposm proud to be Leader of the party.” Mr Corbyn ruled out endorsing tactical voting but admitted he was “looking forward” to seeing Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of universal credit, lose his seat to his Labour rival.  “Iaposm not in favour of tactical voting. I want the Labour message to be there clearly all across the country.” He has ruled out forming a coalition in the event of a hung Parliament and asked whether he would stand downhe lost insisted: “I donapost intend to lose”. But after shadow chancellor John McDonnell appealed for the next Labour leader to be a woman, Mr Corbyn yesterday admitted there was a “fair case” for that to happen. He also hopes that in the future there would be two Labour deputies – a man and a woman. Mr Corbyn revealed the first thing he would do on walking through the famous black door of No  would be to check out the coffee machine – so he would be equipped to work late into the night.

The first time it even got in my head that I should even run here was when I watched I, Daniel Blake, the Ken Loach film, because I know that experience to be true, and I saw it in my mum, the indignity in how she was treated by the state.” In , Nuzhat died from an infection following the transplant. Her last hours were spent waiting for help on a trolley in an over-run NHS hospital, struggling under Tory cuts. “Mum was a classic front-of-the-Mirror story on a trolley,” Faiza says, her voice catching. “She was so vulnerable to infection, she’d just had a heart transplant’.” If there is a point on the map that most symbolises the fight between Labour and the Tories this election it is right here. “There’s no undoing that pain that was caused,” Faiza says. “But I do think there’ll be a bit of justice for everyone that went through thatwe can get Iain Duncan Smith out.” As we walk around the corner to see the two-bedroom terrace where she grew up, it’s clear there’s more to the story of Faiza’s childhood. “I’d stand here some nights,” she says, “looking at the house, dreading going in”.  Her story comes tumbling out. “My dad isn’t a good man,” Faiza says. “He was a temperamental character. Moody and a very dficult person to live with, especially for my mum.” She hesitates. “To the point that people would come to my house and find my mum beaten up. That’s why the community is so important to me now, because people did have to look out for us.” Her Fijian father, a car mechanic, had settled in Chingford in the s but met Faiza’s mum in Pakistan when he was visiting his sister who had settled there. In England, he had experienced racism so severe that at one point a man set fire to the newspaper he was reading. He taught his kids the teachings of Martin Luther King, as well as how to punch, in case of being confronted by racists. “We lived in Walthamstow for a couple of years and that was a really bad time for us,” Faiza remembers. “My dad left for a while, the house didn’t really have any heating, it was really atrocious, my mum was on benefits. Then my grandma made him come back from Fiji and we all moved to South Chingford.” She looks up. “Mum’s le was so unfair,” she says. “Within six months of my dad eventually leaving for good, she went for a routine test and her heart burst. I’m sure it was related. Coming from Pakistan, orce was a big deal.”  Her mother was fiercely bright and fought all her le to be recognised. “When mum was growing up in Pakistan, she went on hunger strike to stay in education,” Faiza says. In later le, Nuzhat went on to join a pioneering medical team working on stem cell research at the Royal London Hospital, as a researcher. “She never got enough credit for the work she was doing.” Faiza says. “Mum ended up winning an out-of-court settlement. But she lost her job, the thing she wanted most of all.” Instead Nuzhat put her hopes into her children, naming her middle child ‘Faiza’, which means ‘winner’, and ‘Shaheen’ which means, ‘flies high’.” These are the names that the Labour candidate now uses, the ones on the posters looking out across Chingford. “I dropped my dad’s surname,” Faiza shrugs. “It’s nothing to do with me any more.” She tells a story of her dad coming to see her at Oxford University. “He was crying, which was strange because my dad never cried,” Faiza says. “He said: ‘All those years ago in Fiji and we would do test papers with Oxford University Press at the top and I never thought my daughter would come here’.”  She went to see her father, with her husband the Prison Break actor Akin Gazi, because she had heard he was dying. “I told him mum had died,” she says. Faiza says it’s her mum who was the fighter, but Faiza too has been fighting her whole le. She went to Chingford County High School, the same school as David Beckham and Harry Kane. “After that, my mum’s plans for me always included Oxford, a Masters, and Phd,” she laughs. “Which was statistically so unlikely.” Having achieved all three, Dr Shaheen now runs a thinktank, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies . “Obviously, my mum was disappointed,” Faiza laughs. “She’s Pakistani, she wanted me to be a medic.” Now she faces a tough battle in Chingford and Woodford Green, where the election fight is as dirty as they come. “The lies and the gutter politics are straight out of Trump’s playbook,” she says. Nicknamed the ‘British AOC’ after the Democratic politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Greggs where she once did early shts has sold out of vegan sausage rolls thanks to the hundreds of young activists come to canvas for her. We are back in her constituency office, in a parade of shops next to a Brexit-loving hairdressers. There are so many IDS posters in the window that it looks like it’s advertising the Chingford Skinhead.“This battle is even bigger than the NHS and Brexit ,” Faiza warns. “It’s about values that will be held at the very top of our society and it really does scare me that that set of values could win. That’s why we’re fighting so hard, that’s why all these people are here. I just think that the stakes couldn’t be higher.”Her gaze strays to the pile of posters in the office. “Mum would have loved to see my poster in all these windows now,” Faiza says. “She’d be telling everyone, ‘that’s my daughter’.” She laughs. “My mum would always say, ‘my daughter is going to stand on the highest mountains’, that’s the translation from Urdu.” This Thursday, should Faiza Shaheen bring down Iain Duncan Smith, the voters of Chingford and Woodford Green may start to see that prophecy come true.

Mum of two Kertu Babik, said she was reduced to tears and left pleading with nurses to see a doctor. Her three week old baby girl, Blanka, was eventually diagnosed with bronchiolitis and spent a week recovering at Leeds General Infirmary. The family have decided to speak out in support of the mum who found herself under fire after revealing her four-year old-son’s plight. Kertu, , and partner Benjamin, , are at pains to say the doctors and nurses were “phenomenal”.Benjamin said: “The staff are truly amazing, we love them. But the NHS is like a sinking ship where the talented band are still playing.” The worried couple spent an “exhausting”  hours waiting for treatment after arriving at AE with Blanka at .pm on November . They had travelled to the hospital on the advice of their midwe as their baby was coughing and lethargic.  Several hours later, around .pm, they were sent to the Children’s Assessment Unit, where they waited in a “dark and boiling”, corridor. Eventually, at midnight, they were transferred to a treatment room where their baby was diagnosed. They insist it was not until am that they were put on the ward with a bed and cot. The hospital say it was am. Kertu said: “I was feeling so poorly and my baby needed to be held constantly in an upright condition because she was coughing.  There was no air and it was so very hot and I was worried about her. She is tiny. “I was in tears when I went to the nurses at .pm to ask how long before we saw a doctor. They said soon, but it was not until midnight. It was not until much later that I found out how serious her condition was and she could have died from it.” Software developer Benjamin, of Leeds, said: “I saw children sleeping on sofas and plastic chairs.Some were on makesht beds with two chairs put together and a parent was sleeping next to their child on the floor. When we got a bed I felt guilty stepping over them.” “We’ve only decided to speak out because of what the other mum has had to put up with. She was not lying about the state of the NHS.” It also follows the story of nine-month-old Lily, who was forced to wait six hours for a bed while poorly at the Countess of Chester Hospital in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.Ben said: “I have watched the NHS gradually decline over the last  years. My mum used to be a nurse and my two aunts are still. My grandparents came here as refugees from Poland and Austria. He served in the Polish air force and later the RAF, going on to fight at Normandy. They would turn in their gravesthey saw the NHS they were once so proud of.”Lisa Grant, Chief Nurse at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: “I’d like to sincerely apologise to Blanka and her family for the long wait they experienced when they attended our hospital. Our Chief Executive, Julian Hartley, has offered an apology. “Our hospitals are extremely busy and are experiencing signicant demand. On busy days in our Children’s Assessment and TreatmentUnit we usually see up to  patients in a day.

That is my election message to Daily Mirror readers. The choice on  December is between a Labour government that will repair the damage done to your communities by a decade of austerity, or a continuation of Tory cuts and crises. Working people know which Party is on their side. Which Party offers real change – and can be trusted to deliver it. It will never be Boris Johnson’s Conservatives. They are the Party of the well-to-do and the privileged, and we can be sure they will continue to put the interests of the rich first. Johnson thinks that Brexit is his trump card. And I know that many Mirror readers voted to leave the European Union in . I can understand why they did. I don’t live in the metropolitan bubble that many politicians seem to. Communities felt abandoned. Left behind as decent well-paid work was relocated where, town centres rotted, the sense of stability and security was destroyed and their opinions ignored. People are concerned about the greedy bosses who use and abuse migrant labour to undercut wages and conditions. It’s not the migrant workers who are to blame but the unscrupulous Companies and Agencies. But I tell you this. If the Tories get re-elected nothing is going to change. The left-behind won’t catch up. Our towns will be left to rot for another generation. Only Labour will fund an investment programme on the scale needed to fund the jobs and industries of the future. Only Labour will stop the undercutting of wages with Labour Market Regulations.  Only Labour will rebuild our public services by taxing the super-rich and the corporate elite who can afford to pay more. Only Labour will end the scandal of people depending on foodbanks to survive, and lt children and pensioners alike out of poverty. Only Labour will create a real Living Wage of £ an hour minimum, and end insecurity at work by giving all workers new rights and abolishing zero hours contracts and bogus self-employment. And only Labour will save the NHS from privatisation under the Tories, and give our hospitals, doctors and nurses the funding they need to do their job.  That is the sort of programme that our communities need. This election is about far more than “getting Brexit done”, which will not on its own solve a single pressing problem. That does not mean that we can just forget about Brexit. Unite has all along recognised the importance of delivering on the  referendum result. But Boris Johnson’s deal is a bad Tory deal that will see many thousands of jobs lost in our manufacturing industries, aswe haven’t lost enough already. Brexit does not need to risk jobs nor the sale of the NHS to Donald Trump’s pals. We can do better than that. That is why Labour will negotiate a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the rights of workers and consumers - rights that the Tories will rip up as soon as they get the chance.

Fit and well, it came as a huge shock. Not least to his family and fiancee Kayleigh with whom he’d only recently welcomed new baby son Owen. But determined not to let the condition change his le, Dom carried on working as a customer service manager at TSB in Sunderland to support his family, even while having a form of chemotherapy. Dom spent weeks in hospital being treated with Lemtrada, which works to reset the immune system. He had two courses of the treatment,  months apart,  which aims to reduce the number of relapses by about %. Thankfully the treatment, at the Sunderland Royal Hospital, was a success.  “After the second treatment, I felt my le turn around and I had a renewed vigour and energy,” says Dom, now , and a Customer Service Team Manager at the Sunderland Contact Centre.“Mentally the whole has process has been tough as I didn’t know anything about the condition.” Determined to help others like him, the now father-of-two wants to give back. This September he ran the North Run, asking people to sponsor him so he could raise funds for the Multiple Sclerosis Society. He gave himself the apt name ‘MS Warrior’ and raised over £,.“I also created an Instagram page to try and inspire and motivate others who had the condition. I wanted to show them to keep up hope and that they could carry on with their lives.“Within weeks I had hundreds of new followers. I think my message must have got through. I just wanted to show people that le doesn’t have to end just because you have this diagnosis.” Now his courage is being recognised after he was first nominated and went on to win a Pride of TSB Award. Jacqui Wilkinson, a senior manager at TSB Sunderland, said: “Even having two years worth of chemo didnapost stop Dom working or being a vital part of our migration team by re-writing training support packs while he was in hospital. “He is an inspiration to all who meet him in and outside of work. His close work with our local Hospital and MS charity has changed his le and made him feel le is for living.” And Dom said: “I thought this was the perfect opportunity to raise awareness about Multiple sclerosis which is an unpredictable and incurable condition that affects peopleaposs nervous systems. “I feel the Multiple Sclerosis Society can contribute to make people’s le a little more comfortable and continue to work on finding a cure. I also feel it is really important to raise awareness as it’s a relatively unknown condition - so people who have been newly diagnosed don’t know what they are facing.  Thankfully I have received many dferent treatments to keep the condition under control.” Dom, who is now planning further feats including the London Landmarks half-marathon in March, added: “I want to give something back as I am currently feeling the best I have felt since my diagnosis. Not only that but I want to make my sons Owen and Leon, , proud.”To support Dom go to his instagram page @mrmswarrior .

But they have today hit out at their new accommodation - a tiny flat in Brentwood, Essex.Speaking today to Essex Live , Donna said: One of the children has autism and being in a confined space he suffers quite badly. Normally he can take himself off. But here there is nowhere to go.There’s nowhere for Solly to go, we are all on top of one another. No one is giving us straight answer. I just want an answer. Solly, -year-old Ryan and a nine-year-old are sleeping in the living room. Everyone , including Donna, Robert,  and Connor, , along with four children all aged under ten, are sharing one bedroom – two children are top and tailing in one bed. The other bedroom is inhabitable due to mould. But Brentwood Borough Council, which is controlled by the Tories, said none of the works on the previous three-bedroom house had the appropriate permissions from building control or housing. The family, who had been living there for  years, were rehomed after a prohibition order in response to a category  hazard was issued.  I know we shouldnapost have but I did it to make the family more comfortable. It was there four five years, Solly said. Then the council came round to do an inspection, looked in the loft and told us we weren’t meant to have a bedroom in the loft. But there are ten of us in a three bedroom house. We needed extra space. I didnapost do it out of maliciousness. I did it to house our family. The council says by removing and cutting away at the support joists, the remaining timbers were bearing six times their safe load. It adds that the conservatory can be seen pulling away from the wall. Solly said : The engineer said it is bearing six times the weight but all I did was put floorboards down and plaster board up. They said Iaposve removed joists which I havenapost. He believes the building inspector was in the property for around  minutes and didnapost even go in the loft before making a judgement.

Mum-of-two Deirdre McShane, , had been swimming with a friend on Monday morning when she got into dficulties in the high waves. Local resident Aine Paterson spotted both women in the sea when she was walking her dog on the beach along Co Antrim in Northern Ireland. She managed to pull one of them to safety before recovering Deirdreaposs body.Aine told Belfast Live : I went for my normal walk on the beach and saw what I thought was a big bit of drtwood being washed into the shore.“Then I thought it was maybe a seal but then I realised it was a person as I got closer. “She was trying to get out of the water and I just dragged her out of the water. Her legs failed and she kept passing out...I got her sitting up a little bit but then she would pass out again. When she looked out to the sea again, she saw another person in the water. I realised then there was somebody  in the water but the waves were so high, you just wouldnapost have seen anybody toady. I went into the water and there was just, well, she was gone at that point...I knew. I just wanted to get her body out of the sea.Deirdre had worked as a community midwe for many years in the Co Antrim area and was a member of the Frosses Medical Centre in  Ballymena  . A source said: “Deirdre was well known and well loved in the area. She was a fit and a very physically able woman who always seemed to be cheerful and ready to help anyone she could. “She had helped so many women and families over the years and welcomed hundreds of new lives with such ease and love, it’s just hard to fathom she’s been taken from us. “It’s well known she was one of the open water swimmers in the area and she seemed to go down with a group on a very regular basis to start the day with a swim. “Tragically today she’s died doing what she loved and her loss will leave a huge gap in this community. Now we are praying for the safe recovery of her friend who is also known to so many of us. The first call for help was made to the emergency services at .am and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service sent a number of crews to the scene. The Coastguard also received a call around .am reporting two women in dficulty in the water.A spokesman said: “We tasked two RNLI leboats, one from Red Bay and one from  Portrush  and two coastguard rescue teams, one from Ballycastle and one from Coleraine. A Coastguard rescue helicopter was also sent to the scene. As the first team was arriving they reported that the two females were out of the water. The ambulance service was dealing with the casualties so we stood down the two RNLI leboats and the Coastguard helicopter. Deirdreaposs friend was taken to Causeway Hospital where doctors described her condition as aposstableapos. Cara McShane, SF councillor for Causeway Coast  Glens Borough Council said she was related to Deirdre McShane. She said: Ballycastle is reeling from this tragedy this morning. There would have been a large group of people who, on a daily basis, would have been swimming on the beach. Deirdre is such a lovable person, really well liked and loved. She is such a pillar of strength for her own two children - and she is such a careful and cautious person who wouldn’t have been doing anything that was at all reckless. This would have been a regular thing. She would have been going for a swim this morning and then going to work. She has a long term partner and we are all devastated for her immediate family. Deirdre worked as a community midwe so she would have been well known, particularly among young families. DUP election candidate for the area, Ian Paisley described the death of Deirdre as an aposabsolute tragedyapos. He said: It is a regular beauty spot for people to go swimming... and you usually find a lot of accomplished swimmers up round there. Unfortunately it appears one of these poor people have got into tragic circumstances, maybe caught in a riptide. Another person is in hospital, I understand quite seriously ill with hypothermia. My heart goes out to them and their families. A Northern Trust spokesperson also paid tribute to Ms McShane. They said: The Northern Trust team and in particular our midwery colleagues, are heartbroken by the tragic death of Deirdre McShane, who was a community midwe in the Ballycastle area. We extend our most sincere and heartfelt sympathies to her partner, her two beloved children and the wider family circle.

Ash Lammin, who was born a boy, began insisting that she was a girl as soon as she could speak, according to her mum. Terri, , said that watching her daughter - who was born Ashton - grow up confused and upset by her body was heartbreaking. She said: Although she was born male, from the moment she could speak Ash insisted she was a girl. By age five, she was asking aposwhen is someone going to chop my winky off apos - and questioning why she had it at all. Family photos from Ashaposs upbringing therefore mask a very dficult period for the family, who live near Ramsgate in Kent. In one, Ash is splashing around in a bath, wearing a sparkly mermaidaposs swimming costume and looking like an average three-year-old girl - obsessed with pink and wearing a princess dress, the sort of thing thataposs usually seen at birthday parties. But, Terri revealed, the only reason she was wearing her swimming costume in the bath was to hide her body - which had dismayed her from an early age. Ash says that it has been dficult growing up as a trans girl, but says she feels that she is firmly on the right path. She said: The journey is long and itaposs still going, but I feel like the sense of victory is there through it all. I do feel accepted sometimes, but other times not.  Not everyone is going to understand and people have to have their own opinions and I understand that. Some people might not like the idea of trans. I hope I inspire others but I just hope that love and acceptance comes through everything. According to her mum, Ash is the perfect example of a child who has been born in the wrong body. Now, aged almost , she is embarking on a y journey to transition her gender from male to female at an NHS-run clinic - and is one of the youngest in the country to do so. Ash - who changed her name by deed poll to Ashley when she was eight - will start by taking hormone blockers to halt the onset of puberty.  She has researched the process incessantly - and eventually wants a womb transplant so that she can be a mother when sheaposs older. While some critics have accused Terri of taking drastic decisions on behalf of a child who is too young to know better, she points out that Ash will take the blockers until she is . At that point, she herself will decide whether to go ahead with gender reassignment surgery. If she decides not to go ahead with it, Ash will come off the blocker - and her puberty will kick in just a few years later than her peers. Terri said: I never thought it was a phase, Ash was just Ash. When she was three she said to me, aposIaposm a boy because you gave me a boyaposs name - itaposs your fault.apos  I remember feeling horrible, because she blamed me. I personally thought maybe this was what an extremely camp gay man is like as a child. Iaposd never come across it before and I just went along with it. I just thought apos heaposs happy, well thataposs the main thing. But Terri, who has seven other children, said that le became much harder when Ash started at primary school. She said: I sent her to school in a boyaposs unorm. I felt awful, she didnapost want to wear it and I was making her. The school were great. The headmaster at the time said apos you think itaposs going to make le easier then bring Ash in a girlaposs unormapos, so I did. I was in a right state. I thought aposeverybody is going to think Iaposm weirdapos - but Ash loved it, she found it easy.  Before, when I was taking her into school, she was biting me and kicking me, she didnapost want to go in. As soon as she put the girlaposs unorm on, she wanted to go every day. Despite the schoolaposs willingness to help and the kindness of Ashaposs classmates, Terri says that other parents were very dficult - leaving her out of social events and complaining that Ash was using the girlsapos toilets. She added: When Ash was Ashton, she was invited to all the kidsapos parties, even though she used to turn up in a princess dress. The parents didnapost mind then. But as soon as I let her be Ashley all the time, for a whole year she didnapost get invited to one party. The kids were fine itaposs not the children, kids play with anybody. Itaposs not until an adult comes in and says you shouldnapost do that then it changes. When Ash turned  and went to secondary school, she became a target for bullies who would throw things at her on the bus and shout apostrannyapos at her - forcing Terri to take her out of the school after just one term.

By the end of January all playthings will have been removed from Daisy Chains nursery in Prestatyn, North Wales.Instead children will be able to play with everyday items such as pots, pans and crockery, the Daily Post reported. Fancy dress costumes such as princess outfits have also been thrown out, to be replaced with real clothes. The move has been welcomed by parents who support the schemesapos ambition to foster the imaginations of the nurseryaposs children. Rebecca Wright, who runs the nursery, said: I have always wanted the nursery to be toy free. Parents will have all had the situation where you buy a child a big expensive toy and then they play with the box, that should tell you something. When I told staff some were initially a little taken aback but they have quickly seen the benefits and everyone is fully onboard. Parents have loved it too, tech has its place and kids take pictures and make plans on iPads but parents love old school skills. Expensive toys take away imagination, with this everyone benefits, the children, staff and the envrionment.  Rebecca said that a lot of research had been done suggesting there were positive effects of putting children in a toy free environment. They are dressing up using real clothes, using household things like pots and pans, pieces of pipes or building blocks, she said. There was some apprehension  over the crockery but everything we use is risk assessed. We need thinkers and doers. We need people who think outside of the box, we will need creative thinkers for the jobs that we will be creating in  years time.

She added: It was late and probably quite cold outside and he lives a long way away. I had no reason not to let him in.

So far Iaposve found an imunotherapy and a protontherapy for my type of cancer but they are only available privately. I need to work out what the best course of action is to take. Iaposm trying to deal with having chemo and the emotional impact itaposs having on my family and doing the research on top.

And now her family are asking anyone with information on Plemomorphic Rhabdomyosarcoma to come forward. A fundraiser has also been set up to try to raise money for an alternative treatment. Nikki said: Anything at all will help and Iaposm very grateful for anything. It just gives me hope that I can do something about this because being told that you could be dead in  months time is grim.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

If you do hit a deer, report it to the police, evenyou are uninjured and your car is not damaged, as the deer may be fatally injured and suffering.Jamie Hammond, SNH management officer."},{"url":null,"title":"stars rough start continues with defeat to league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star are still looking for their first points in this season#s Premier One campaign after another disastrous first half saw the Lochgilphead side trail - at half time against table-topping Easthall at the Ropework.The home side steadied the ship in the second half, however, and pulled a consolation goal back through a well placed effort from Lee MacLean # though the damage had been done in a first-half spell where Star shipped five goals in the space of half an hour.On Saturday November , Red Star travel to play Argyll neighbours Dunoon AFC looking to pick up their first win and move themselves off the foot of the table."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 15 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan took this wonderful photograph of autumn on the Crinan Canal.Avril said: #You take things for granted until you take a walk.#"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 2","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode Delve once more into the wonderful golfing world of Bob MacIntyre with George Graham, Keith McIntyre and Stephen Day in Episode  of this Oban Times Podcast # This week #  broken clubs, statistics, slices and more.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-screen-pocket-turning-total-idiot","story":"BBC Scotland airs a timely documentary tomorrow which looks at the use of digital devices like smartphones and iPads by the average family.

Dad Jason spent . hours a day online ndash as much as most of us sleep. Six-year-old Danielle was on a screen four and a half hours a day.Mum and dad have wasted years of their lives online which could have been spent with their children. The documentary uncovers how the couple have lost three years with eight-year-old Charlotte, two with Danielle, and one year with Alfie. Theyrsquove also wasted much of their own relationship. The Mitchells have been together ten years, but a third of that was spent on screens.In the film, the family agree to an intervention. Their devices are removed for five days. They blossom ndash they play games, talk, instead of a screen at bedtime the kids get playtime. Therersquos lots of closeness, hugs, kisses, eye contact. Before, they were like the living dead. Now, far from being bored, they feel alive.Within minutes of getting their devices back, though, the Mitchells are all staring blankly at screens. Ghosts to each other again.

Itrsquos executed with a lightness of style, and a youthful tone, which hopefully catches the eye of young families who need this cautionary lesson, but the message is pitch black: screens are poison and theyrsquore ruining you.The mantra that all technological progress is good has been shown to be utter nonsense.

The evidence is almost irrefutable, and I have to come clean about this for the sake of my own consciencehellipThe whole sorry story kicks off on Sunday afternoon. My fourteen-year-old son, Ben, is enjoying a hectic day of sofa slumping. Phone in hand, hersquos engrossed in a YouTube video showing another fourteen-year-old boy slumped on a sofa watching a YouTube video.ldquoFancy an entertaining night on the tiles  I ask him.Ben doesnrsquot glance up from his phone. ldquoIrsquove got to watch this before doing anything , he mumbles. ldquoItrsquos the most important YouTube video Irsquove watched since the last one I watched half an hour ago.ldquoHow long will it last  I ask.ldquoJust a couple more hours, he says.At which point I amputate Benrsquos backside from the sofa, dislocate his brain from YouTube, and guide him firmly in the direction of Glasgowrsquos west end, where Elfingrove awaits us.All of which sounds like fun, especiallyyoursquore into over-the-top Christmas events, which I certainly am. At this time of year my inner child executes a daring Steve McQueen-style prison break to go on an eggnog fuelled rampage that doesnrsquot end until December the th.However, itrsquos my other child, the phone-loving dude who goes by the name of Ben, who Irsquom really hoping will enjoy this eveningrsquos entertainment. Although therersquos a sizable risk he wonrsquot be impressed at all. And not just because the night doesnrsquot involve any YouTube celebrities.Elfingrove has become a controversial topic on social media, with a number of mums and dads complaining that itrsquos overpriced and under-imagined. Of course social media doesnrsquot always provide the most balanced of forums. Take a reasonable comment, pluck it from its moorings and drop it in the Twittersphere and strange things start to happen. Like Dr Jekyll gulping down a pint of bubbling green potion, that same innocent statement will rapidly morph into something a lot less innocuous. It soon becomes a snarling, cackling, half-crazed, ldquoWit-you-lookin-at-pal  screech of unbridled rage.So perhaps social media manufactured the entire #elfingroveiseffinrubbish brouhaha.That doesnrsquot stop me feeling a tad trepidatious as Ben and I scurry through a west end thatrsquos being relentlessly rained upon by a mob of heckling storm clouds that are clearly on the side of Twitter and Facebook when it comes to the Elfingrove altercation.Benrsquos not making me feel any better. The daggers hersquos flashing me are the only thing illuminating the night sky. Until we reach Kelvingrove Museum, that is. Suddenly therersquos light everywhere. The entire faccedilade of the building has been turned into a modernist canvas, with spotlights painting wild patterns on the brickwork. Irsquom impressed, and sois Ben.Things improve even more when we reach the grounds of Kelvingrove, where a Christmas market has been rolled out. Readers of last weekrsquos Diary at Large may recall that I was disappointed with the Christmas market in Glasgow city centre. This onersquos smaller, though better, with more of a cosy Crimbo feel.Tents have been erected, similar to Native American teepees. Inside therersquos good cheer and drink. Opposite the teepees are food stalls and wood-burning fires for roasting marshmallows on sticks.Therersquos also a silent disco tent, which intrigues Ben, though wersquove no time to pause as wersquore racing up the steps into the museum. Awaiting us inside is an elf. Actually itrsquos an actor in an elf suitthough I donrsquot tell Ben this, not wanting to spoil the momentrsquos magic.ldquoOh look, itrsquos an actor in an elf suit, says Ben. Sometimes I forget hersquos . Almost a middle-aged bloke. Any moment now hersquoll be smoking a pipe, griping about the youth of today and voting to bring back hanging.Though hersquos not there yet, and I can tell that he is , ,starting to enjoy himself. Though obviously he doesnrsquot tell me that, as it would ruin his cool. The actor elf informs us shersquos in charge of elf and safety.She also gives us a card to guide us through the museum. It lists a number of elves wersquoll meet on the way, to be ticked-off on the card as we spot them.And so we head into the bowels of the museum. First up, therersquos a series of sculpted heads hanging from the cavernous ceiling in the main hall. Regular visitors to the museum will know this installation predates Elfingrove by quite a few years and was created by the artist Sophie Cave. However, for Elfingrove the heads have been brought to le. Almost. While spotlights flash upon them Queenrsquos Bohemian Rhapsody booms out, making it appear as though the heads are belting out the lyrics.Upstairs we come across more elves and more playful content. Therersquos an elf in charge of wrapping, although on this occasion thatrsquos been updated to mean rapping. Yrsquoknow, like P. Diddy and Emimem. This particular elf isnrsquot the best rapper Irsquove heard, though that doesnrsquot seem to bother the kids. Theyrsquore mostly primary school age, so probably arenrsquot well-versed in the traditional rapping lore of hook-ups, hold-ups and hustles. Though even a mature fellow like Ben is enjoying the performance.He also gets into the spirit of things in ious other rooms, dutully writing a letter to Santa which he slides down a chute.Then therersquos a Christmas Knight Out, with a pair of armoured knights battling in a corridor in a scrap to the death. Or at least until theyrsquore thoroughly knackered, which they seem to be already.Next up, we meet Rudolf. Though in this case hersquos not a reindeer but a roaring, robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex. We also come across a dancing fairy and some massive brussels sprouts hanging from a ceiling.An attempt has been made to enliven the spitfire that dangles from the museumrsquos western court. Flashing lights streak along the planersquos wings, and the roaring noise of engines create the illusion the planersquos in flight.Clearly a great deal of ambition, creativity and hard graft has gone into creating Elfingrove. So are the grumpy parents on social media being meanspirited  Not entirely.Some of the elf actors are a little bit awkward and amateurish, though Irsquom guessing the cream of the local acting talent are hamming it up in panto, this time of year.The major set pieces, such as the singing heads and flying spitfire, are impressive. Though not especially Christmas flavoured. Meanwhile the more intimate happenings lack a certain level of razzle-dazzle, and could almost have been cobbled together by a particularly energetic primary school teacher, well-versed in the wonders of glue, string, sticky-tape and papier-macirccheacute.Now Irsquom starting to sound like one of those Twitter tantrum types. So Irsquoll also add that the younger kids seemed to be having a ball. Plus a few of the older ones, too...ldquoTime to go home, I inform Ben, after wersquove roamed the museum for a couple of hours. ldquoBut I havenrsquot been in the silent disco yet! says Ben. ldquoAnd therersquos still a few rooms in the museum Irsquove got to seehellipHe shakes his head in disappointment as I guide him towards the exit gate.And so, because of me, the poor wee fellow only got to enjoy the singing heads, the flying spitfire, a mountain of marshmallows plus a few other quirky moments of minor magic.I told you I wasnrsquot much cop as a dad.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But to be able to now officially say we have raised over twice the amount we set out to achieve is absolutely amazing. The donations came in thick and fast, and we are so grateful to all of those who contributed in any way. Orkney is a tremendously generous place, and the community has yet again come up trumps!#The rest of the money came in from donations from generous iniduals and businesses across the county, via a the newspaper or through The Orcadian website.“All of the money raised in this campaign will stay in Orkney, and is earmarked for this project, so we will very much look forward to seeing how the CLAN team get on with their plans.“They make such a dference to all of us who have been affected by cancer in any way, by giving advice, a supportive shoulder, support, therapies — even organising a roof over our heads during treatment.“They are truly amazing, and this money will mean that more people can benefit from the fantastic work they do.”#The monies raised, by the people of Orkney and further afield, through The Orcadian’s ‘OutreachCLAN’ appeal, will enable us to reach out to more people across the county who are affected by their own or someone ’s cancer diagnosis, and for that we are truly grateful.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yet nothing is certain. Boris Johnson could still miss the goal spectacularly like Diana Ross famously missed that penalty at the ‘ World Cup opening ceremony.He undoubtedly has flair and talent, but can he be trusted to deliver  That has been the central issue that has limited his undoubted appeal and held him back from achieving an unassailable lead.At the outset of the campaign I argued that the election was Boris Johnson’s to lose. The danger facing him was that having benefitted from the public’s growing sense of grievance about Parliament obstructing the deliverance of Brexit he might be drawn into fighting on the ground of his opponents choosing where he could be more easily beaten. He might lose points on the NHS, he might be outflanked on social care or ridiculed for increasing police numbers that his party originally cut. Whatever the issue, Johnson had to remind the public that the general election had been called earlier than should be expected, and thatthey truly wanted to end their boredom and exhaustion with Brexit they must make a choice between giving him a majority – or sending him packing.In the end, from my own admittedly subjective viewpoint, Johnson has managed to hold on to a diminished lead because his main opponents have been unable to land any signicant blows. Indeed the very question of being able to trust Johnson that has been levelled at him by other leaders such as Corbyn, Sturgeon and Swinson has only raised the questions of trust in them.Labour’s revered Aunt Sally – the threat posed to the NHS by the dreaded Tories – becomes less convincing each time she is wheeled out in her bathchair. Thanks to the changing demographics a lot more demand is putting a strain on resources and with changing technology the costs rise further. NHS costs keep going up and this will not change whichever party governs the nation. Labour can argue you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS all it wants but it rings hollow when we know they say this every election and that every time they are in office they increase spending on the NHS – even during the period of austerity when other departments had their budgets cut.Nor do the attacks from Labour and the SNP about the threat of privatisation of NHS services have credibility.Their idea was to use President Trump as a bogey man but my MEP colleague Henrik Overgaard-Nin, a practising dentist and former head of the General Dental Practice Committee, utterly demolished this thesis last week by categorising how it has been the European Union forcing the growth of private provision of services in the NHS. Likewise it is the EU that was pushing a trade deal with President Obama that could have opened up the NHS further.In all of these points it is those such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson who by fighting to deliver Brexit are the real defenders of the NHS remaining accountable to the British electorate.In Scotland, the claims of Nicola Sturgeon are especially weak. The scandals of the tragic and avoidable deaths of children in Glasgow’s new infirmary due to contaminated water, and the unopened Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh costing an extra £ million that leaves her especially vulnerable to an accusation of rank hypocrisy. Claims about trust on law and order under Johnson – made after his promise to recruit , more police in England when it was the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who originally reduced their numbers following the great recession – have no value when put by other parties who have their own records to feel ashamed about. This week in London the th murder was committed, surpassing last year’s total of  with three weeks of  still to go. The comparison of Johnson’s record as London mayor against the current Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, puts labour in the dock, not the Tories. Likewise the state of Scottish policing was brought into sharp focus by the resignation of Susan Deacon as the chair of the Scottish Police Authority claiming its governance and accountability is fundamentally flawed.While the issue of trust has undoubtedly undermined the Boris Johnson campaign it has not been a knockout blow, for sadly too many politicians come with the same reputational challenge about trust. Nicola Sturgeon promised the  independence referendum was “once in a generation” then “once in a letime” vote but started campaigning for a second referendum practically from the moment her campaign was defeated. At first she was careful enough to suggest it might take a few years but now, five years on and she has been pressing incessantly for a second vote – certainly not a generation later.Corbyn has his reputational problem with past associations with terrorist groups and now wishes to take our industrial relations back to the unrest of the seventies. Then there is labour’s ant-Semitism problem. Do people really trust Jeremy Corbyn The largest issue of trust for me is Johnson’s claim that only he can “get Brexit done”. It is proving a convincing slogan with the public fit to burst over the incessant parliamentary infighting and sharp practices to deliver a deal that suits the EU and leaves our country ided. I do not accept Boris’s “deal’ is anything other than an attempt to move the issue out of the public eye and play down the further capitulations of the UK’s interest that are yet to come. I fully expect the Prime Minister to get his majority and therefore get his deal through parliament – but I do not expect him to secure anything like the free trade deal with the EU that he claims is within his gt, nor do I expect him to go for leaving without a deal – so I foresee yet another extension to our membership after the end of .That’s why we need Brexit Party MPs to press Johnson to deliver, without them millions will have no voice. I would like to think I am wrong but this Brexit General Election could well prove fruitless and undermine public trust in politicians even more.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch brexit won t get done if boris wins an snp backed labour government is safer bet","story":"#Getting Brexit done# will simply continue to overshadow everything , says Lesley Riddoch.If the Tories get a working majority on Thursday, as predicted, will Boris Johnson actually get Brexit done  Will politicsto something like normal Even at a time of fairytales, flying reindeer, Wise Men and Tinkerbell most adults realise the answer to both questions is a resounding no.Passing Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreementmarks only the end of the beginning – the first stage of a bitter, contested orce which moves on to the financial settlement and future trade negotiations. These must be concluded more speedily than any similar deal in political history andthe shambolic UK negotiating team fails – by accident or by design – the inhabitants of Britain will face the same “no deal” clf edge next Christmas that was supposedly seen off in .This much we know. Every news bulletin and parliamentary debate will continue to be dominated by Brexit in . Uncertainty will blight investment, job security, le-plans, recruitment and the quality of public services. The unbelievable total of , nursing vacancies in the English NHS will not diminish but increase as EU workers finally depart for good. There will be no Golden Age for public services – why should there be when the new boss is actually the old boss  At a deeper level, how can Brexit ever “get done” when leaving is bitterly opposed by millions of voters who will neither abandon their commitment to European identity, nor be accommodated in any way by the new Prime Minister. Thus, Europe will only become more isive and totemic as an issue and will continue to distract from the seismic issues of inequality, climate crisis, and democratic modernisation the entire British political system has chosen to ignore. Most Tory voters and even Brexit supporters know this in their hearts.They back Boris, not to get Brexit done but because he’s the one who lets them dream a while longer, indulges make-believe, allows disorientated people to take respite from the bleakness and empty affluence his party has created with the vain hope of making Britain great again. No harsh realities, dficult choices or tough reappraisals from Santa Johnson. You only have to believe in his magical powers, his innate superiority and his bona fides. Or pretend. It’s like an electoral version of the Stockholm syndrome. Some depressing yet powerful human dynamics are at work.So, a Boris win is likely – but looking on the bright side, a Tory majority would change the thrust of political debate in early .Firstly, it would rob Boris Johnson of the chance to keep posing as the champion of The People against an evil, unresponsive, high-handed Remainer Parliament. If he becomes Prime Minister again, that “self-serving political elite” will largely be his own hand-picked “do or die” foot-soldiers. Any mistakes, delays, crassness or missed deadlines will be entirely and demonstrably his fault and no-one ’s. Alienated Tory big beasts like John Major will join with expelled grandees like Michael Heseltine to rub the new leader’s nose in it – and he must watch for signs of mutiny amongst hisloyal band of lieutenants Gove, Hancock, Javid and Raab – all of whom wanted to be leader themselves. At the first sign of trouble they could try to challenge Johnson, supported by Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May on the backbenches, nursing their wrath to keep it piping hot.Boris may be the darling of the Tory Party membership, but he will have very few friends in Parliament or , in the capital city. Is Johnson an accomplished political tightrope walker – we may soon find out.Secondly, an overall majority would probably also rob Boris of his best recruiting sergeant – Jeremy Corbyn. Not even Teflon Tony could have withstood the sustained and concerted hatchet-job Corbyn has faced every waking day for the last five weeks. The Labour leader has made the media’s job easier than it needed to be, but he’s also overseen a much-needed policy alignment. If Labour’s popular programme of renationalisation and public ownership is wedded to a new, more articulate and assertive leader – Boris will face real, spirited political opposition every inch of the way in . Thirdly, a Boris working majority would also end the absurdity of Arlene Foster and the DUP \u2028representing the views of Remain voting Northern Ireland. Greens and other small parties won’t stand against some Alliance and SDLP candidates, so there’s a chance Ms Foster’s personal authority will be seriously clipped – and that this could precipitate the much-predicted break-up of Britain.Astonishingly, it’s influential parts of the London media who’ve decided that’s on the cards.Channel Four anchor Jon Snow is travelling around the Celtic nations, making a series of films about dissatisfaction in the devolved nations. Radio Four’s flagship World this Weekend is planning an hour-long debate on the future of the United Kingdom for next week. Doubtless, more is planned.It’s ironic. The Conservatives have won elections in the teeth of fierce opposition from Scots for decades. But Brexit has finally thrown that crushing unfairness into sharp relief and a supportive media spotlight. So too have recent opinion polls which suggest a majority of Scots would support independenceBoris Johnson triggers withdrawal from the EU. London’s sudden interest in Scotland’s constitutional bind is welcome, but dangerous too. Enthusiasm may soon waneScots don’t live up to our newfound billing as the Remain rebels who Won’t Stand For Brexit. Unfairly, since no smaller member of this “family of nations” has yet found a way to exercise authority or be heard. But the British media doesn’t do fair, patient, marginal or incremental. So, the pressure will not relent. Brexit won’t get doneBoris wins the vote. And an SNP-supported Corbyn government is still a much better bet.

All elections are important. But rarely have the stakes been so high.Let’s start with the nightmare scenario. If Boris Johnson gets a majority, he will drag Scotland out of Europe against our will and we’ll face another five years of Tory chaos.It’s hard to imagine someone less suited for the office of Prime Minister than Boris Johnson. We would all prefer that political disagreements were about policy, not character. And, as far as Boris Johnson actually believes anything at all, there’s plenty to disagree with. But character is important, especially in political leaders. Boris Johnson simply can’t be trusted.This is a man with a long record of insulting minorities, of dodging responsibility for his actions and of being economical with the truth. Unbelievably, the highest court in the land had to intervene after he unlawfully shut down parliament. Boris Johnson is not just more of the same – he’s much worse than that. If he wins a majority of seats, he will take that as a green light to do whatever he wants to Scotland.Let’s be clear: the Tories’ central election promise to ‘get Brexit done’ is a lie.The Tories haven’t even started talks with the EU about our future relationship. Experts say that process will take years. If you’ve thought Brexit was a mess so far, it’s only going to get worse. With Boris Johnson desperate for a trade deal with Donald Trump, there’s a real threat to our NHS. There is another way.A vote for the SNP on Thursday is a vote to lock Boris Johnson out of office. Elections can be hard to predict, and this one is no dferent. Butthe result is close, Scottish seats could make the dference. In every single Tory seat in Scotland, it’s the SNP who are the challengers. In fact, every opinion poll shows that the election in Scotland is a two-horse race between the SNP and the Tories. We can’t wake up on Friday to five years of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. Instead, let’s rally round the only party in Scotland who can beat the Tories.We will push for more investment for the NHS – which will in turn mean a funding boost in Scotland – with our plan worth more for the health service than any other party. We will demand an end to the welfare cuts that have left families on the breadline and driven up foodbank use. We will fight for a fairer deal at work, with a radical extension of parental leave and a real Living Wage for all. And we will push the UK government to match Scotland’s ambition on climate change.The SNP are offering a chance to escape Brexit and put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands by reinforcing our right to choose our future as an independent country.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"author simon griffin on why people have forgotten about good manners","story":"When I was young I wanted to play in the National Basketball Association. By the age of about  I realised this was increasingly unlikely to happen, partly based on the fact that most other boys were at least a foot taller than me by this point, but largely based on my complete lack of ability. But as I lay on my bed looking up at my carefully curated collage of adverts torn out of FHM and Loaded magazines, Michael Jordan looked back at me and told me to Just Do It.Whether it was inspired by Gary Gilmore’s final words before being executed doesn’t really matter, in  Nike’s trademark slogan was being plastered all over the world and  years later it’s still going strong. It’s enabled and empowered new generations of go-getters and high achievers – the ultimate mantra to prove anyone from anywhere could achieve anything in lethey put their mind to it. Wake up, get up, and Just Do It. Do early morning yoga classes, do a gym session at lunch, and do a creative writing course in the evenings so you can do your blog. Do a marathon at the weekend. Do that job promotion, do that new business plan and do the extra hours that you know will pay off one day. Do work emails in the rain whilst ignoring your children playing rugby, do amazing meals with exotic ingredients imported from all over the world and do luxury holidays filled with doing even more stuff. Fill your le with acts of great signicance and meaning and they will build statues in your honour. Just F***ing Do It.Of course, we also need to remind ourselves that we need to do the washing up, do the laundry and do the weekend shop too. All the stuff that Jordan and Charles Barkley never seem to mention in their adverts, like doing the car insurance renewal. We live in a world of perpetual doing. The list simply doesn’t end. There’s never a point where you get to check your list and say with a smug smile, “I’ve got nothing to do.”Which is perhaps exactly why we need to force ourselves to do less. Give ourselves time to switch off and do absolutely nothing.A few thousand years ago our lives were a lot more simple. Not necessarily easier, but certainly less filled with stuff to do. You got up, ate, fed your livestock, went in search of food, spent some time sharpening spears or arrows, looked for more food, then maybe whiled away a couple of hours making fires or doing some recreational drawing on the walls of your cave. Today – thanks to the miracle of smartphones – we can’t go  minutes with checking to seesomeone’s emailed a message that we probably don’t want to read, or updated their profile with a picture we don’t want to see.Not only are we stuffing our lives with more stuff to do on a daily hourly minutely basis, but we’ve more choices than ever before. A few years ago one national supermarket chain had  ieties of air freshener,  types of rice,  ieties of cola and a mind-blowing  ieties of coffee. No self-respecting café in  would ever dare offer you the binary option of black or white. We want dferent blends from dferent countries with dferent methods and dferent syrups and dferent milks and dferent foams.All this stuff squeezed into exactly the same amount of hours in the day that our cave-dwelling ancestors had. We simply don’t have the time for things to go wrong, sosomeone dares behave in a manner that dfers slightly from our own expectation of acceptable behaviour – for example, eating a boiled egg on a crowded commuter train – then a whole arsenal of toys are going to be ejected from the pram.Manners have nothing to do with class or wealth – as so frequently demonstrated by a iety of overpaid public figures – they cost nothing, after all. But they do take time, and in our busy little bubbles that’s almost more valuable than money. We’re cash rich and time poor, so who gives monkey’swe offend a few people by clipping our nails on the train or pushing to the front of the queue  You’ll probably never see those iniduals again anyway. We’ve all got a million things to do and are constantly reminded of the million things other people are doing, so the faster we can get things done the better, right  Well wrong. The faster we get things done the faster we get them done. Doing things properly always takes a lot more time, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “Manners require time, and nothing is more vulgar than haste.”Whether you’re doing the weekly daily hourly grocery shop, taking a group of hyperactive kids to the cinema, or signing up at your local meditation class, please, forget just looking after number one, and be on the look-out for number two as well. It’s much more dangerous when it hits the air-cooling device.We’re not talking Mother Teresa levels of selflessness here, just a few moments of clarity when we acknowledge that perhaps flossing your undercarriage within two feet of someone’s face in the changing room, might not be to everyone’s delight. A little lightbulb that pings on as you smugly sprint to the front of the newly opened checkout that tells you maybe other people have been waiting a little longer.We don’t need to Just Do It or Live Le to the Max. Turn off your f***ing phone and experience the truly le-changing miracles of doing one thing at a time. Only when we can treat ourselves to this level of kindness, will we be able to pass on that kindness to others.Simon Grfin is the author of F***ing Good Manners .

And nothing on Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.Admittedly the splash headline “Corbyn has made Labour a welcoming refuge for anti-Semites” was legitimate. It was taken from the Jewish Labour Movement’s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commissioninquiry. And what a damning submission it was.It said the party to which its members belonged “promotes anti-Semites to positions of power does not take actionagainst those guilty of abhorrent anti-Semitism victimises those who speak out against anti-Semitism fails to protect Jewish members from anti-Semitism allows Jewish MPs to be hounded out of their political home and derides the issue of anti-Semitism to the extent that its very existence within the party is denied.” Such criticism was not unexpected. In the past decade Corbyn has been involved in a succession of incidents – from his defence of an anti-Semitic mural in Tower Hamlets to the glowing foreword he wrote to a book laden with anti-Semitic tropes – which appeared to validate suggestions he was fostering a culture of racism. To understand the impact this has had on Jewish members one need only look as far as East Renfrewshire – home to the largest Jewish community in Scotland. For more than  years this constituency ed Jim Murphy, Blairite and one-time member of the Labour Friends of Israel group, as its MP. Last week, the current Labour candidate Carolann Davidson told a Glasgow Jewish Representative Councilhustings the Labour Party did not deserve their vote. She said she’d only come to reassure them some Labour politicians refused to surrender to racism.With Jewish MPs including Luciana Berger forced out, you would have to be a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist to believe Corbyn was being ly smeared . You might wonderfive full pages on the EHRC investigation and no pages on – for example – the poverty that is blighting the lives of hundreds of thousands of children at Christmas – was politically motivated. And you might go on to surmise that, while all racism is equally bad, some forms of racism are less equally bad than others.While Corbyn is suffering as a result of his failure to address anti-Semitism, Boris Johnson is shrugging off quite blatant Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, such as Sally-Ann Hart’s claim that learning disabled people should earn less because “they don’t understand money.”We know Johnson is racist, because racist sentiments so often pop out of his racist mouth. He has talked about “piccaninnies with water melon smiles” and compared Muslim women to letter boxes. In , he described Islamophobia as the natural reaction to Islam, while in  he suggested Malaysian women coming to UK universities were looking for a man to marry.Like Corbyn, he has promised to root out the problem while continuing to support those who embody it. He promoted Zac Goldsmith to his cabinet despite Goldsmith’s Islamophobic London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan, and he continues to employ Tommy Robinson’s pal Chloe Westley as an aide.You can detect the same notes of betrayal in the voices of Berger and Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, who described the past four years as like being in an abusive relationship. She spoke after discovering a promised internal investigation into Islamophobia was to be watered down to “an investigation into prejudice of all kinds”.The incidents of Islamophobia go all the way down into the grassroots of the party. Earlier this year, the Conservatives suspended  party members for a string of abusive social media posts, including one that called for all Muslims to be turfed out of public office.Then, last month,  sitting and former Tory councillors were suspended in another social media scandal in which one poster referred to Muslims as “the enemy within”.The party insists such suspensions are evidence of a zero tolerance approach. What, then, are we to make of ministers Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom and Thérèse Coffey, who have been out on the campaign trail supporting candidates facing claims of Islamophobia  Meanwhile Channel ’s misquoting of Johnson – it claimed he uttered he words: “people of colour” when, in fact, he said “people of talent” – is \u2028being touted as evidence he is not prejudiced. In fact it is merely evidence that, now and again, he remembers not to gt-wrap racist ideology in racist rhetoric.This “talent” quote is a sanitised expression of an immigration policy that created a hostile environment for asylum seekers and deported British citizens back to the West Indies. Let’s not get too outraged with C for mishearing something that, to most people, seemed entirely plausible. And, while criticising Corbyn for failing to apologise for anti-Semitism during his Andrew Neil interview, let’s not forget Johnson wouldn’t submit to the Neil interrogation. And that his response to questions about Islamophobia in the latest leaders’ debate was to change the subject back to Brexit.All this measuring of Labour and Tory sins should not be reduced to whataboutery. But it very often is. The way in which the partiesturn examples of their rivals’ racism into anti-ballistic missile systems capable of combating their own is demoralising This election should not be a game of bigotry Top Trumps. The Conservative Party’s racism does nothing to dilute the Labour Party’s nor ought there to be some hierarchy of hatred. Still, it is worth asking why there is so much focus on one type of racism, while another is seen as more trivial. And why – when the concept of anti-Semitism is rightly sacrosanct – the Spectator and other right-wing publications feel free to carry columns suggesting Islamophobia is a fiction created to silence criticism of fundamentalism  The consequences of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are almost identical: fear, hurt, and radicalisation within affected communities, and a rise in hate crime towards them. Othering is othering is othering. Whether you are a Hasidic Jew visiting the synagogue in Gfnock or a bearded Muslim attending a mosque in Pollokshields, the misery of being insulted, spat at or attacked is the same. It is to be hoped the EHRC launches an investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party as it has into anti-Semitism in Labour to reinforce that any form of racial discrimination is unacceptable and must be rooted out. And that – instead of posturing and preicating and pointing to each others’ flaws – all the parties will come to a consensus on the iniquity of religious ethnic hatred: for the sake of social cohesion and so their own exiled members canto the fold.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"former labour mep urges scots to vote snp in general election","story":"A former Labour MEP has urged Scots to vote SNP tomorrow to keep Boris Johnson out of Downing Street.In a letter to The Scotsman on the eve of polling day, Hugh Kerr warns against the prospect of a “hard right Tory government” and calls for tactical voting for the SNP in Conservative constituencies north of the Border.He writes: “As a former Labour member and MEP I would appeal to Labour voters in Scotland to vote SNP and get rid of the  Scottish Tory MPs who gave the Tories a majority at the last election.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH2911NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 29th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland.

The first occurred in the Ligoniel Road on May , with the second happening on the Crumlin Road on May .The -year-old has denied all six charges - including attempting to murder police officers, possessing explosives and causing an explosion - and was called to the witness box on Tuesday.Under questioning from her barrister Tim Moloney QC, Connor spoke of her Republican background and her involvement with the Republican Network for Unity .When questioned about the two incidents in north Belfast, Connor admitted she was out for an early morning walk in the area at the time of the second incident, but denied involvement in both incidents.Mr Moloney began his questioning by asking his client about her education, family background and employment history.She was then asked whether Republican politics was an important part of her upbringing, to which she said \"yes, very much so\". Connor said that around late  and early , she was actively involved with RNU which she described as \"a political organisation, not an armed group\".Connor said she and other members took part in protests, pickets and camp-outs \"to highlight the plight of republican prisoners\", with one such protest taking place outside the Alliance Party HQ in south Belfast when the partys David Ford was Justice Minister.When asked about other organisations, Connor said she was \"not aware\" of United Struggle\" and was \"aware of... but not part of\" ONH.Mr Moloney then turned to the \"specics of the allegations of the offences\" she was charged with.She was asked about former co-accused Stuart Downes, who was charged with offences linked to the incident. Downes - who the Crown say assisted Connor by purchasing component parts for the pipe bombs and ensuring they were delivered to Northern Ireland - died in June .Connor denied communicating with Mr Downes and when she was askedshe ever pretended to be Swedish model Sanne Anderson, she replied: \"no\".Mr Moloney then questioned his client about movie clips - one of which was found on Mr Downes phone and another on a laptop found in a mattress in her bedroom.Its the Crowns case that one of the clips is Connor conducting a \"dry-run\" of the route she planned to take before launching the first pipe bomb attack on May .Connor denied making the video, and when asked \"is that your voice on it \", she replied \"no it definitely is not.\" She also denied being involved in the incident.Mr Moloney then turned to the events of May , and when he asked Connor \"were you out and about that night \", she said she was. When asked why, she said: \"It is something that I did regularly.\"If the police had gone through CCTV for the weeks, months and days before that, they would have noticed that. It was something I did regularly.\"Connor then outlined the route she took, which included walking on the Ligoniel and Crumlin Roads as well as roads and streets in Ardoyne.Connor was then askedshe brought a bag with her and she replied \"yes... for water. I have type two Diabetes and Im constantly drinking water.\"When asked what type of bag it was, Connor said it was a Tesco reusable bag. And when Mr Moloney asked Connor \"did you carry pipe bombs in that bag \", she replied \"dont be ridiculous.\"Connor was also asked about hearing loud bangs when out walking at around am. She said she was \"about four minutes from the junction of Crumlin Road and Ligoniel Road\" when she heard the bangs.Connor said she recalled talking to a woman on the street who was in her pyjamas, they had a brief chat about the bangs and that Connor told the woman she had dropped her phone.The final line of questioning was about her arrest on May ,  and the police interviews.Connor denied putting a laptop and other material in a mattress found in her bedroom, and when asked about a pair of boots also seized, Connor said they didnt fit her and werent her size.Mr Moloney closed his questioning by asking Connor why she gave no response to questions asked during multiple police interviews. Connor said that whilst in custody in Antrim for seven days following her arrest, she had two dferent solicitors - both of whom advised her to make no comment.The non-jury trial is due to resume on Wednesday morning when Connor is expected to be cross-examined by a Crown barrister."},{"url":null,"title":"couple shaken after burglars force way into belfast home","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The current policy of a fixed penalty notice of £ for offenders up to the value of £ shoplting is clearly not working.\"Mr Roberts believes the problem could be even worse than believed, with under-reporting of the crime being common among many of the retailers that he speaks to.\"I think the real figure is actually higher, given that a lot of these shoplting cases are not reported,\" he said.\"A lot of businesses consider it to be too much time having to go to court and that kind of thing. That means staff members are out of the businesses for the day and one of their colleagues has to come in to cover for them. It all mounts up.\"A lot of our members have really upped their game in terms of CCTV.\"Much of this is clearly the work of organised gangs that move from city to city and town to town. \"Aside from the pressure it puts on the business owner and their bottom line, it also puts pressure on staff.\"Many of these staff, when confronting shoplters, have been assaulted themselves.\"Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts urged the public to be vigilant, to avoid stolen and counterfeit goods and to report suspicious items and people.\"The goods people purchase may be dangerous and could pose a health risk,\" he said.\"I would urge people to be thoughtful around counterfeit goods theyre buying.\"It is essential that businesses report crime when it does happen, evenbusinesses view it as a small loss.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both are happening at the same time,” she said.When asked what presenter agreed to have their pay cut and by how much she said: “I can’t comment on that at this stage. It was in excess of %.”She said she would not like to see the Government introduce legislation to regulate pay at RTE and said it should be “left to the open market”.Asked about the  million euro cost-cutting plan, Ms Forbes said half of this will be made up of what she described as “people costs”.“We expect in the region of  staff will leave RTE in a combination of voluntary redundancies,” she said.Ms Forbes said the current collection system of the licence fee is untenable and the  euro fee for the licence fee represents good value for money.She said it costs the equivalent of  cent per day, per household and is better value in comparison to online streaming services such as Netflix.She said RTE offers more homegrown programming than equivalent public service broadcasters across Europe and cited the Late Late Toy Show which attracted a live audience of . million people across the world."},{"url":null,"title":"follow northern irelands general election results with belfast telegraph","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed. We were only  minutes in and pan-nationalism and pan-unionism both seemed in tatters – except in North and South Belfast of course.Eastwood has enjoyed a good campaign. The nadir of his party’s  removal from Westminster left some wondering whether the SDLP would ever . He now stands of the brink of heading here along with a colleague. The SDLP leader may also have been buoyed by the apparent photo endorsement from Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Interesting that, given it is only eleven months since the launch of the “historic partnership” between the SDLP and, er, Fianna Fáil — a tie-up rejected by the SDLP’s MP-to-be in South Belfast.Naomi Long performed solidly and it has been a fine year for her party, its vote up % in the council elections and % in the Europeans. But a First-Past-the-Post contest remains dficult terrain for Alliance. Another issue is that Westminster contests are for the true believers. In , those identying as unionist or nationalist were twice as likely to vote as those eschewing such labels.The debate moved onto the health crisis and the associated problem of Assembly restoration. It was everyone ’s fault that it was mothballed. Not their party’s responsibility. Oh no. Michelle O’Neill gave no ground on an Irish Language Act, insisting it was a right. “It’s not an either or” in terms of a Language Act versus dealing with the health crisis was her line. Good luck with those talks on Monday, Secretary of State.Each representative performed creditably. But how much any of Tuesday night really mattered is questionable. The viewing figure for Sunday night’s UTV leaders’ debate was just shy of ,. More watched the programme immediately afterwards, where the contestants had to eat grubs in a jungle.

His media performances have been first-class, and this was no exception.Two SDLP advisers accompanied him to the debate, but he didn’t need them. From start to finish he was passionate, polished and professional. He was streets ahead of Michelle O’Neill. While he scored countless points against her, it wasn’t in a destructive way.His most successful moments were when he challenged Sinn Fein on abstentionism from a pragmatic, not ideological, position.He blew away the argument that going to Westminster made no practical dference.Whether we liked it or not, massive decisions were taken there, and MPs had already stopped Brexit several times. “We need to be there fighting against Boris Johnson, locking him out of Downing Street,” Eastwood said.He brushed off claims that this stance was at odds with pulling out of North Belfast for an abstentionist Sinn Fein candidate.“I’d much rather have John Finucane sitting in his house than Nigel Dodds sitting in the House of Commons,” he replied.There was a stinging one-liner to the DUP about how “no amount of Ulster Hall meetings or banging drums” would change things on Brexit. Eastwood’s words will have secured him no friends among unionists. But his eyes are focused on Foyle, and he may well have won over soft Sinn Fein voters with this sparky performance.Emma Little-Pengelly, DUPEmma Little-Pengelly DUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.The word was that Nigel Dodds would stand in for Arlene Foster in this debate but the DUP opted for Emma Little-Pengelly as a substitute.She is fighting to retain her Westminster seat from the SDLP so prime-time media exposure helps. The outgoing South Belfast MP performed well given that she has considerably less experience than her rivals in such scenarios.Her opening statement was excellent. Her brief was obviously to mention the DUP’s £.bn confidence-and-supply money for Northern Ireland as often as possible. The repetition does get a little tedious. Naomi Long at one stage said the money was “a drop in the ocean” of what was needed to turn around public services here.Little-Pengelly didn’t have answers for some of the criticism her rivals made. On a Brexit plan, the best the DUP can come up with is that a hung Parliament is likely and it will exert its influence againholding the balance of power.Little-Pengelly did handle Steve Aiken’s assertive approach expertly. Her barrister training clearly helps.She came across as moderate and measured, and that will do her no harm in South Belfast.She held up her party’s manesto twice near the end of the debate. That is aimed not at the DUP’s core voters but at the middle-class unionist constituency whom the party wants to win over with its policy detail.Naomi Long, AllianceNaomi Long Alliance at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Naomi Long started nervously, and that is not like her. She and Steve Aiken were the only leaders to look at their notes during their opening statements.But from there on the Alliance leader was in top form. She tackled both the DUP and Sinn Fein very successfully several times.There were some stinging one-liners. Long insisted it wasn’t a choice between dealing with health and an Irish Language Act — “we can walk and chew gum at the same time”.In the health discussion, she raised Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and Little-Pengelly’s husband, which clearly is uncomfortable territory for the DUP.Less successful was Long’s metaphor about Brexit unicorns and donkeys. She has used it too many times and it has lost its appeal.The Alliance leader was totally honest about our NHS crisis, admitting there isn’t “a silver bullet or magic wand”.She was taking no prisoners regarding the DUP and Sinn Fein’s record of government at Stormont. Alliance, the SDLP and UUP sat around the Executive table while the two big parties sat in another room and carved things out between them, she said.Long came across as that rare breed — a straight-talking politician with integrity. This performance strengthens her image as someone who wants to get things done here but is frustrated by the obstinacy of others.Michelle O’Neill, Sinn FeinMichelle ONeill Sinn Fein at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.This was a typical Michelle O’Neill performance. She didn’t drop the ball, but neither did she run with it and score.Sinn Fein prefers script over spontaneity, and its vice-president stuck to that approach. Tory austerity was a get out-of-jail card whenever her party’s own record was raised.Her best line came when accusing DUP politicians of initial over-excitement about their influence at Westminster. “They’re now sobering up to the reality thatyou’re bought, you can be sold,” she said. The image of a drunk DUP will have raised smiles in a fair few homes. O’Neill’s weakest moment came when she was asked why there was only a single line in Sinn Fein’s manesto about health. “This election is all about Brexit,” she said.Neither had O’Neill answers as to why as Health Minister she didn’t reverse the DUP’s decision to end pay parity for health service workers here. In her favour, she came across as pleasant, and someone who can definitely do business with unionists. She is no bogeywoman..jpg\" title\"Sinn Fein Deputy leader Michelle ONeilland DUP South Belfast Candidate Emma Little-Pengelly during the recording of UTV election debate at the Queens Film studio in Belfast.

Despite a very bitter election campaign, don’t be surprisedthese two parties manage to overcome their dferences on an Irish Language Act and reach a deal that willthem both to power at Stormont.Steve Aiken, UUPSteven Aiken UUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Steve Aiken went into this debate determined to tackle the DUP, and he did so with gusto. Indeed, with so much gusto that he faced allegations of aggression from Emma Little-Pengelly.There was an awkward moment during the Brexit segment when the DUP candidate tried to cut across the UUP leader. “Wait!,” he said firmly, and put up his hand. A male politician saying that to a female one just doesn’t look good, whatever the intention. It wasn’t helped by Aiken then saying to her: “Don’t tell me I’m wrong!”The UUP is taking an assertive approach towards its DUP rival in this election and that is tactically no bad thing. But the tone of this particular exchange was perhaps not the wisest. The substance of what Aiken said, unlike the delivery, was actually very good.The point that a border down the Irish Sea appeared on the DUP’s watch and “Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds, Sammy Wilson and you Emma” bear responsibility will hurt the DUP. Although it may not lose that party support, as grassroots unionists seem to blame Boris Johnson alone for the Brexit betrayal. Aiken called for a health emergency to be declared here by London rather than waiting for theof devolution.He pointed out that when the UUP held Stormont’s Health Ministry there were , on our waiting list compared to , now. But his whole performance, unfortunately, just didn’t hang together."},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein brings rent freeze measure to the dail","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But she said the current lack of government and the welfare reform mitigation packages coming mean \"things are getting worse\".And now CiNI is asking all political parties to commit to ending child and family poverty and to make it a priority as well as urging local businesses to provide vital financial support to its Holiday Hunger projects to help the organisation ultimately achieve its end goal of \"ending holiday hunger\". Carrickfergus mum Cathy, who took part in CiNIs Carrickfergus Gets Active programme, and whose children accessed food and activities last summer, said that sometimes food banks are her only option.\"As parents youre trying to find the money for everything - the money for clothes, the money for food, and trying to get the money for all the clubs,\" she said.\"You dont have that money to go out and buy a proper dinner every night in the week, youre having to rely on food banks at times to get the kids fed.\"Referring to the Get Active summer scheme, however, Cathy said it was a huge relief \"not to have to worry about where were getting the money for the kids from\".For further information, call Children in Northern Ireland on   ."},{"url":null,"title":"airport closed after plane comes off runway","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The decisive score came in the st minute with a winning goal from St Conors midfielder Eoin Mullan. The sides met in the group stages and it was the Tyrone side who prevailed.

So instead of saying ‘no, no no!”, ‘don’t touch’ or spending hours re-doing them every night, why not give your child a Christmas box  Simply fill a shoe box or a large cloth bag,with the decorations you don’t want any more, decorations donated from a friend or cheap ones bought from a bargain shop. Just make sure they aren’t dangerous, can’t be choked upon etc and let your little one feel the textures, enjoy the sparkly colours, see and touch the glittery baubles, the soft Father Christmas or sparkly beads, maybe you could even buy a little cheap tree for them to decorate! Add to your Christmas box wrapping paper, bows and ribbon to feel and crinkle and of course to wrap ‘presents up’ too , and of course Christmas cards to write on!Salt dough, to make snowman ornaments or baby hand prints to sprinkle with glitter and nish, just remember to add a hole before you bake them so they can hang on your tree. .Shake  Snow, wash an old jar and it’s lid and allow to dry. Stick a Christmas ornament to the lid , pour glitter, sequins or pretend snowinto the jar. Fill about   way with water, add approximately two tablespoons of glycerin and stir. Put on the lid and shake - fabulous! .Christmas cards, who doesn’t like a home made card! Here are a few suggestions For baby - paint their feet, print onto card and write mistletoes! For toddlers - paint their hand white and print onto cardstick on a Christmas hat, add two black finger print eyes and a smile of course!. For older children paint their hand brown, cut it out and stick onto card, add google eyes, have the finger part pointing downwards as the legs and the thumb as the face, draw on antlers and a red nose and decorate Rudolph with sparkles! Christmas cutting, children love to look at pictures of toys they’d like, younger children love to cut and toddlers love to glue and stick. So pick up a toy catalogue next time you are out and let them, or help them to make a Christmas stocking picture of what they might like! Great for practising cutting and fine motor skills, may also give you a few ideas too! Quick tip, plastic scissors are awful to learn to cut with so do buy a normal pair BUT do watch your little one with the scissors as you don’t want your child to have a ‘home done’ hair cut at Christmas!Christmas tree, easy, easy easy - simply cut out a Christmas tree shape, let your child decorate it however they want , stick the back of it onto a toilet roll and there you have it a stand up tree!Christmas biscuits, mmmm. Make simple biscuits and use a cutter to turn them into snowmen, decorate with icing, smarties and sweet laces for a smile, then deliver to your parent and toddler group or nursery class. . Just remember these activities are meant to be fun, so don’t take over, let your child do it - not you,you want you can make one too !Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

He imposed all the suspended sentences concurrently and imposed a six month sentence on the latest charges.  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams.Funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -.Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims to support the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages.“We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI.NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period.Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it.“The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained.The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.”The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information.Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.”For more information go to www.ccskills.org.uk or email nicep@ccskills.org.uk googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Endorsing Colum Eastwood Felix Healey said: It’s better to be inside trying to change, as opposed to being outside and having no impact at all. “I remember a time, i’m old enough to remember when people in this city voted for one man one vote, it’s important to use that vote and see that vote being represented in Westminster… “I’m calling on people to support Colum Eastwood and vote SDLP.” Speaking following the endorsement, the Foyle SDLP candidate said: “I’m honoured to have the backing of Derry City legend Felix Healey. Felix is a proud Derry man - and knows the challenges we face here just won’t go away by representatives staying outside of Parliament. googletag.cmd.push “Derry needs an MP to fight against Brexit, against cuts and to stand up to Boris and the DUP. We cant just wish Derrys problems away - we have to be there to defend our interests. “That’s why I’m asking people to come out and support me in this election - I’ll go to Westminster, I’ll take my seat and I’ll vote against Brexit, against Boris and against the DUP.

It came from a poor line-out which saw Derry lose possession and Enniscorthy broke quickly with second row Tomas Stamp scoring and Ivan Poole converting for the first of seven tries.Enniscorthy, with just one defeat in seven games ahead of this one, had the lead they wanted and they picked their moments again and again to frustrate Derrry. The home side looked short on ideas against a disciplined defence with brief forays by the energetic Simon Logue giving glimmers of hope, but the final pass did not live up to the build up.Enniscorthy were devastatingly efficient and when prop Sam Duffy was yellow-carded on  minutes the visitors wasted no time in striking again, a line-out ending with quick passing which opened Derry up for Ivan Jacob to score right under the posts. An easy conversion for Poole made it -.A frustrating first half ended on a positive note for Derry with Alex McDonnell converting a penalty to get the hosts on the scoreboard, but a big effort was needed second halfthis was going to go anywhere for OKanes side. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The next score was crucial in this one and Derry began the second period positively, but within ten minutes the comeback looked beyond them as Enniscorthy, so clinical, hit two more scores. Davy Murphy hit the visitors third try to put daylight between the teams and after another yellow card, this time to Derrys Dara Gill, Poole scored and converted to make the score a daunting - with just  minutes played.This Derry team are not known for giving in however and to their credit they responded well to score their first try. David Ferguson was the driving force behind the period of pressure which eventually led to the score, with McDonell eventually picking his way through the Enniscorthy line to score a try which he also converted.Any hope of a comeback was killed inside four minutes however when David ODwyer replied for Enniscorthy to make it -. Kept comingAt this stage the win was Enniscorthys but Derry still kept coming. A yellow card for Enniscorthys Paddy Waters offered a glimmer of a hope of a losing bonus point and when Callum OHagan scored to take the game to -, it became a real possibility. One more score would have given Derry that point but in the dying seconds of the game, two misplaced passes gave Kidd and Dunne simple scores, to put an emphatic score on the result that Derry did not deserve.All eyes now turn to the game at Midleton this week, with Derry desperate to get another away win to take the pressure off. This defeat sees Derry drop two places to ninth in Division C but four points on the road this week could change the picture dramatically and see Derry enter the play-off places. With Midleton also desperate for points to avoid become marooned at the foot of the table, it will be all to play for in the last game before the Christmas break.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

But we cannot achieve net zero without government investment.“Any measures farmers take towards net zero will require investment and signicant changes, and we need the future government to create policy which ensures these steps are not only right for the environment, but right for our businesses too. With the appropriate research and a range of incentives to help farmers improve productive efficiency, increase carbon capture and boost renewable energy, we can build on our work producing high quality, sustainable food for the nation. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “British farmers are part of the solution to the climate crisis. We have a huge opportunity in this country to be pioneers in climate-friendly food production – we have the ambition, we just need the right policy to support us.”Here in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Farmers’ Unionsays farmers and their farm businesses must be considered part of the solution when it comes to tackling climate change.\u2028UFU president, Ivor Ferguson said: “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a huge challenge for agriculture in Northern Ireland. But we are up for it. There have already been gains with the dairy sector reducing its carbon intensity by  per cent since . “Productive and efficient agriculture needs to be recognised as part of the solution.”\u2028The UFU says it is crucial that in its bid to tackle climate change the UK does not export food production, and as a result emissions, to countries with lower environmental standards or ambition to tackle this important issue. “Hindering domestic food production is not the way to address climate change. In the UK,  per cent of farmland is best suited to grazing animals. The extensive nature of grass based farming in Northern Ireland means we are already largely green by nature. Grass-fed suckler herds help to manage many habitats and produce a quality product from land that is unable to produce other crops. Grassland, farmland hedges and trees are also crucial for carbon sequestration,” said Mr Ferguson.Fake games consoles seized - and some are dangerous Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought -

It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
