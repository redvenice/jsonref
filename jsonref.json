[{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan NOT bring Lilibet Christened Church England","story":"Share this articleIn August, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliam told the Express the couple will \u0027do things their own way\u0027 with their daughter Lilibet. He said: \u0027It seems certain that her christening will be in Meghan\u0027s home state and with the secrecy but without the controversy that surrounded Archie\u0027s christening.\u0027 The couple have never released an image of their daughter to the public, with royal commentator Richard saying the decision shows the Duke and Duchess are acting on their own terms.The latest claims come after it was revealed that Prince Harry was not expected to return to Britain next week to join his brother Prince William at a party to honour their mother. The party had originally been planned for July 1, when the brothers unveiled a statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.Prince Harry flew back for the unveiling without wife Meghan, who had given birth to the couple\u0027s second child, Lilibet.Due to coronavirus restrictions, the plans were scaled back, with just the Princes, their uncle Earl Spencer and aunts Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes present.Harry was due to attend the rescheduled party for 100 guests, believed to include Sir Elton John, on October 19, although it is unclear if Meghan would have accompanied him.However sources this week said it was not expected he would return for this. Since attending the statue\u0027s unveiling, Harry has announced he is writing his memoirs. They are due for release next year, when the Queen will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. In February a spokesperson for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry confirmed the couple were expecting a second child together. The couple shared their announcement - aptly on Valentine\u0027s Day - by posting a black and white image of Harry resting his hand on Meghan\u0027s head as she lay in his lap underneath a tree.\u0027The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple\u0027s longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!\u0027 their spokesperson added. Lilibet – whose middle name is Diana – was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in June.    It is understood the Queen was informed by Prince Harry that her great grandchild would be named in her honour, ahead of their official announcement which was made on their official website. However, Buckingham Palace appeared to be caught off guard by the timing of the Sussexes\u0027 news with a spokesman for the palace congratulating the couple 90 minutes after the announcement broke.    Omid Scobie, a journalist favoured by Harry and Meghan, later tweeted that the couple would \u0027not be sharing a photograph at this time\u0027 of Lilibet and that they were now on \u0027parental leave\u0027. He said the couple\u0027s office was encouraging anyone who wanted to send gifts to support organisations working for women and girls. The name Lilibet was coined by the Queen and used by her younger sister Margaret and their parents.George VI once said: \u0027Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\u0027Lilibet arrived six days before what would have been the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 100th birthday."},{"url":null,"title":"Now Harry Meghan banking","story":"Share this article Meghan last visited the city in September 2019 when she made the surprise stop at the US Open. This came seven months after her last trip, when pals including Amal Clooney and Gayle King held a lavish baby shower for her at The Mark Hotel\u0027s $75,000-a-night penthouse suite on Manhattan\u0027s Upper East Side.The Duchess traveled to that event from London on a private jet, with the bash estimated to have cost $500,000.   During their first stop on their Big Apple trip, Meghan and Harry posed for photos in front of the One World Trade Center observatory\u0027s floor-to-ceiling windows, which offer stunning views of New York City and New Jersey. The Sussexes were joined by Governor Hochul, 63, Mayor de Blasio, 60, de Blasio\u0027s wife Chirlane McCray, 66, and the couple\u0027s son Dante, 24.  Harry and Meghan then visited the 911 memorial pools around 9am EST.  The couple inspected the large black pools, built in the footprints of the original Twin Towers, before entering the 911 Museum, which sits underneath, and spending around half an hour inside.     Harry and Meghan, who donned somber dark outfits, walked hand-in-hand around the memorial pools and museum accompanied by National September 11 Memorial \u0026amp Museum President Alice Greenwald and Patricia Harris from Bloomberg Philanthropy. The couple\u0027s two-year-old son Archie and three month-old daughter Lilibet remain at home in California.  Harry and Meghan arrived at One World Trade Center in sombre outfits, likely chosen for their planned trip to the nearby 911 Memorial afterwards. The couple exited a black SUV, and were whisked up to the skyscraper\u0027s viewing deck - which sits between floors 100 and 102 - to meet Hochul and de Blasio, who arrived moments before the royals.Meghan donned a stylish dark blue outfit, with a matching jacket, polo neck, wide-legged trousers, heels and her hair swept back into a business-like bun.

In addition, we immediately took down the advert for the space pending sorting this issue out.\u0027It is unfortunate that, in this instance, this homeowner (who is not a JustPark customer) took matters into their own hands and impounded the driver\u0027s car and demanded a fee for its removal.\u0027We have rigorous checks in place to ensure that driveways that are advertised on our platform are done so in a proper way.\u0027The advert for this space was submitted to us back in 2019 and our fraud team did highlight this space as potentially fraudulent, but I can see that a number of weeks later the advert was set live - this was human error on our part and we can only apologise for this.\u0027Like all companies, we are sometimes the target of fraudulent activity and our fraud teams work hard to detect this and to protect our customers.\u0027We have thousands of adverts submitted to us every month and the vast majority are genuine - we pride ourselves on being able to help homeowners generate an additional revenue stream, as well as being able to help drivers find affordable and pre-bookable parking spaces in locations that are convenient for them.\u0027We park over 1.5 million cars every month and generate over £50 million each year in parking transactions for our space owners, and have overwhelmingly positive reviews from customers.\u0027On the very few occasions that there are complications between drivers and space owners due to a misunderstanding, we can usually resolve these quickly and amicably.\u0027In situations like this, we would always ensure that the homeowner is compensated appropriately.\u0027However, this incident escalated disproportionately because the homeowner, who isn\u0027t a JustPark customer, reacted inappropriately and completely disproportionately and took the law into their own hands, impounding a vehicle which was parked by a driver who believed that they had a genuine booking.\u0027The booking in question was of course fully refunded last Wednesday.

The carbon centre of gravity is calculated by taking an average of each country’s latitude and longitude, weighted by their annual emissions. The most polluting countries exert the strongest gravitational pull on the centre of emissions. At the beginning of the 20th century the industrial powerhouses of the US, UK and north-western Europe were responsible for the majority of emissions. By the end of the second world war, the global centre of emissions was located a mere 25 miles off the east coast of the US. Since then, rising industrialisation in Asia – led by China – has dragged the centre of emissions more than 7,000 miles eastwards. It is now located on the Tibetan plateau in western China. This representation should not be interpreted as suggesting that the population of China produces a disproportionate amount of CO2. On a per-capita basis, 36 countries had higher carbon emissions in 2020. But the centre of gravity does highlight the importance of getting large emitters such as the US and China to commit to stronger climate policies at the Cop26 summit. New modelling from the International Energy Agency suggests carbon emissions have peaked in the world’s wealthiest economies –⁠ including in Europe and the US –⁠ but are likely to rise in less developed countries over the next decade. This is under a stated policies scenario, which considers current and announced climate policies from governments around the world. To limit global warming to 2C, governments would need to drastically raise their ambition, shutting fossil fuel power plants while ramping up investment in renewable energy and electric cars.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Video: Oireachtas TVAnt \u0026 Dec? No, it’s Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe, just before announcing the winners in Budget 2022. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillWe bumped into an Opposition TD in the corridor.“Slim pickings today,” he sympathised. “It’s hard to heckle Ministers with those masks on. Sorry about that.”The face mask is the enemy of the heckle.Muffled squawks are no substitute for piercing interventions.A decent spot of barracking is usually part and parcel of the budget day experience, but most deputies held back this year, preferring not to sound like they were talking through a mouthful of marrowfat peas.This inconvenient outbreak of suffocating civility allowed Paschal Donohoe and Michael McGrath to glide through their budget speeches relatively untroubled. Lambasted they were not.At least Michael Fitzmaurice kept his end up, bellowing from beyond the perimeter rail about the carbon tax.“What about rural Ireland? Shame on you. Shame on you!” boomed the Roscommon-Galway Independent, who is a farmer and agricultural contractor. “What about middle Ireland, driving to work? Screwing them, that’s what you’re doing.”While the two Ministers worked through their scripts, Sinn Féin’s first responders prepared their replies. Pearse Doherty (marking Paschal) and Mairéad Farrell (shadowing Michael) got busy with their highlighter pens while in the row behind, official anorak Eoin Ó Broin got stuck into the nitty-gritty of the accounts.For the 90 minutes it took the two Ministers to do their thing, Eoin never let up. If he wasn’t feverishly writing on sheets of A4 paper he was belting away on the keyboard attached to his iPad or punching numbers into the calculator on his phone. The detailed budget document was on his lap and he flicked back and forth through it, occasionally consulting the closely written pages of a hardback notebook open on the ledge in front of him.Only when Pearse or Mairéad turned around looking for a steer did he break off from the typing and writing. Sometimes, when a Minister paused, the only sound in the snoozy chamber was the relentless tap-tapping from Ó Broin.Oh dear. Perhaps he’s bringing out another book for Christmas.BrandishingThe day began with the traditional brandishing of the budget statements on the steps of Government Buildings. The Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure were over half an hour late for their photocall but, in a stroke of luck, the notoriously camera-shy Leo Varadkar was forced to walk past the photographers on three occasions.The first was when he walked back to his office after the Cabinet meeting, casually carrying his Cabinet papers in a SuperValu plastic bag. Very Matt Damon. Not, of course, that Leo would have made that connection.Then he walked through the courtyard with a number of advisors, to the silent awe of a party of tourists outside the gate, only to return a short time later holding a takeaway cup of coffee and what appeared to be some class of ice-pop.Finally, the two Ministers appeared, delighted with themselves. They were accompanied by an angst of advisors, who walked them to the steps.Paschal and Michael looked very smart in their smart, non-budget budget suits. One of the advisors spat on a hankie and wiped a smudge off Michael’s scrunched-up face while another spat on his hand and smoothed down Paschal’s little quiff.Actually, no, they didn’t. That was done before everyone walked outside.The second tradition was upheld by the Ceann Comhairle at the start of proceedings when the prayer was followed by the performance of the annual budget joke. They all know what’s coming but it never fails to get a laugh.Seán Ó Fearghaíl reminded the TDs not to leak budget details and to respect the confidentially of the information until the Ministers announced it.“That was not meant to be a cause of levity,” deadpanned the Ceann Comhairle, before succumbing to a sneaky smirk.RavenousThen the ushers filed into the chamber and fanned out among the benches, distributing the weighty documents to the ravenous deputies. It’s normally the early highlight but Mary Lou McDonald’s monochrome tartan kitten heel shoes stole the show for some envious observers.Svelte father of two Paschal flaunted his Eurogroup curves in a grey suit while father of seven Michael’s flattering navy suit showed he hasn’t held onto any of that baby weight.Well done, boys! How do they do it?The third tradition of honouring the Budget Speech Reply Cliches was faithfully observed by Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman Doherty.“This is the 13th time I’ve responded to a budget,” he told the chamber, which was shocking to hear.Thirteen years, man and boy, listening to other people’s spending plan for the coming year.But those long years stood to the Donegal man on Tuesday. He was able to reprise the classics in his reply. Although he reverted to pre-pandemic mode when he began by referring to “Budget 2020”.“This budget is a reflection on the Government that delivered it: out of touch, out of ideas and out of time. Never has so much been spent to achieve so little. No answers, no urgency and no leadership.”It should have been a budget of “vision” and “change”.Any parts he welcomed he said were filched from the Sinn Féin alternative budget.Back to the Government side, where the Ministers declared the country is enjoying the Covid “rebound”.Rebound“We are in recovery,” announced Paschal, pointing to the “remarkable rebound” in the country’s jobs outlook. He talked about “anti-reverse hybrid rules”.Michael quoted Nelson Mandela. He talked about bringing Ireland’s investment in capital to “almost 5 per cent of GNI star”.The budget, by the way, is “anchored in a conviction that we can take the learnings from Covid . . .”In the run-up to the big event, Sinn Féin’s approach to the nation’s finances was described by some commentators as showing a softening towards some aspects of its economic policy, particularly where middle-income earners and certain businesses are concerned. This, it was posited, was to make the party more attractive to more non-working class voters as it powers ahead in the polls.And Pearse Doherty, who normally burst a few eardrums with his annual speech, sounded quieter when he spoke. Another sign of subtle changes in the Shinners?Perhaps not, for following him was Mairéad Farrell of Galway West. She puts Pearse in the ha’penny place when it comes to voice projection.As she neared the end of her high-decibel reply to Michael McGrath, colleagues took umbrage on her behalf, saying the Taoiseach was talking loudly as she was speaking. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle asked a highly affronted Micheál Martin to pipe down. He insisted he wasn’t talking. Later, he explained that McGrath had been showing him some figures from the National Plan, that was all.“It’s so ignorant,” huffed Pádraig MacLochlainn.Labour’s Ged Nash said that Paschal and Michael were “politically indistinguishable”. Like the entertainers Ant and Dec, one of them should stand on the left and the other on the right so people can identify them.Funny, but after the announcement that contraceptives are to be available free to young people aged between 17 and 25, we kept looking at the pair of Ministers and thinking of The Two Johnnies.Speaking of which, we understand Joe Duffy slept in an oxygen tent on Tuesday night to prepare for the reaction."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"casual britain has abandoned high standards","story":"John Lewis has published details of its customers’ shopping habits over the past year. Few will be shocked to learn that sales of tents surged, as staycations replaced foreign travel during the pandemic. Still worse is the news that skin-tight Speedos – the repellent budgie-smugglers once voted Britain’s most reviled item of clothing – have made a comeback, too (perhaps this is what happens when sunbathing in public gives way to sunbathing in the back garden). But most demoralising, to me at least, was the news that sales of suits and ties had slumped, while sales of Crocs had leapt by 58 per cent.I am a longtime Croc-sceptic. Encasing your toes in Tupperware may be acceptable for pottering around the garden or stepping out to empty the bins. I’d give harassed medics on their feet all day a free pass too, along with children, and anyone using the showers at the swimming pool. Beyond these narrow exceptions, however, nothing screams “I’ve given up on life” more than a pair of ugly perforated plastic clogs – usually accessorised with a tracksuit and unbrushed hair. In more hopeful moments, I wonder whether, like toddlers hiding their faces during hide-and-seek, Croc-wearing adults don’t realise that we can see them – but perhaps they do.As with many other trends, what was already under way pre-Covid has been sped up by lockdown. Suit sales were declining well before WFH made menswear even more casual, and suits have undergone many metamorphoses since Beau Brummell first swapped his breeches for long tailored trousers. But recent fashion changes have tended towards eradicating elegance from non-formal settings altogether.Tony Blair popularised the novelty of not wearing a tie – which, in classic New Labour style, managed to be both naff and narcissistic at the same time. Then came Daniel Craig’s James Bond, bursting disdainfully out of his skin-tight tailoring. An Oscar must surely go to whatever technical wizardry helped him execute his vigorous stunts without splitting the seams – if only for special effects.Under lockdown, adults began dressing like children, wearing leggings in non-gym settings. I suspected the citadel had finally crashed when Anna Wintour of Vogue was photographed working from home in a pair of joggers. Then this summer, as if to cement the sense of indescribable loss, Charlie Watts died – easily the most stylish Rolling Stone, and rivalling Bryan Ferry as the best-dressed man of our times. In Parliament, only the efforts of Lindsay Hoyle and his deputy speakers stand between us and sartorial anarchy. As Mick Brown has written so beautifully in these pages, we lose something more profound in this seemingly irresistible march towards casualwear. For what we wear doesn’t just change how others see us, but how we perceive the world. Being smartly dressed makes us feel civilised. Your appearance proclaims: “Here is someone who can be bothered to show up for work, for life, and deal with others politely.” The creeping casualism shows a longer-term deterioration of standards, an acceptance of mediocrity and a kind of unrepentant slovenliness. Declining standards of dress, and WFH, have coincided with decline elsewhere – consider the companies still using Covid as an excuse for shoddy service.Iain Duncan Smith prompted outrage recently after urging workers back to the office in a newspaper column invoking the Blitz Spirit. (“They didn’t have Zoom during WW2, actually Iain!”, cried his critics). I don’t fully agree with IDS – it’s hubristic to think governments should dictate working habits, or attempt to construct them around those companies that stand to lose most from the upheaval – but I sympathise with the sentiment.The remote-working debate has morphed into a culture war, and a partisan issue. While ministers urge us back to the office, Labour makes a play for the WFH classes, by demanding the right to work from home be enshrined in law. At worst, WFH’s most zealous advocates are guilty of precisely the myopia they attribute to IDS. They seek to deny the obvious acting as if inidual decisions carry no external effects, and insisting that what fits some workers must automatically favour companies, even society as a whole.While some will thrive in work from home environments, many others are liable to vanish behind a computer screen and enter a slobby bubble of our own making. This Croc-rich daydream – full of comfort shoes and chocolate biscuits – offers little of the buzz and spontaneity of day-to-day interaction and conflict. We shouldn’t be too cavalier about what is at stake.On the subject of standards, Katharine Birbalsingh, headmistress of Michaela Community school in Wembley, has been appointed head of the Social Mobility Commission. She is often described as “Britain’s strictest headmistress” – an epithet which makes her sound like a cross between Dolores Umbridge and Miss Trunchbull. Yet what she offers is simply what most decent state schools dispensed with little fanfare until a few decades ago: clear rules, discipline, insistence on neat handwriting and smart uniforms. The only extraordinary thing is that Birbalsingh’s values should be considered “abnormal” at all.More from NewsNortherners were sitting ducks for Covid-19Brexit latest news: Leo Varadkar warns world leaders against striking deals with the UK until they are confident ministers will \u0026#39keep their promises\u0026#39If DVLA staff don\u0026#39t get a grip, we face a Christmas without presentsSculptor calls in lawyer to save Hong Kong Tiananmen statuePolice \u0026#39canteen culture\u0026#39 in WhatsApp groups can lead to officers \u0026#39abusing their position for sexual purposes\u0026#39Why Norway leads the world for electric cars - and what the UK can learnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heat pumps must hot air","story":"‘Let’s be frank” said Boris Johnson when grilled by the Commons liaison committee in July. “These things cost about ten grand a pop”.The Prime Minister was referring to heat pumps, which his Government has pledged to install in 600,000 homes every year by 2028. They are a “big bet”, as Mr Johnson put it, in the Government’s strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. They are highly energy-efficient and well-suited to the UK’s relatively mild climate, and are the only commercially proven low-carbon replacement for gas and oil-fired boilers on the market.The problem is that they cost, on average, around six times more than a gas boiler, produce lower output temperatures than their fossil-fuelled counterparts, take up more space and are more disruptive to install. The prohibitively high price means consumer demand to meet the Government’s aspirations is pitifully low. As new Onward research reveals today, the UK is woefully off-track to meeting the 2028 target: on the current trajectory the goal of 600,000 installations per year will not be met until 2057 – nearly three decades too late.If this “big bet” is to pay off, further innovation will be needed to lower their cost and boost their performance. Key to this will be stimulating private-sector investment by incentivising demand and establishing a strong domestic supply chain. The Prime Minister speaks of needing to “build the market in a very systematic way” and he is correct – but until now there has been no systemic thinking. The Heat and Buildings Strategy next week is the moment to set out serious interventions to kick-start the market.The first thing the Government should do is reduce VAT on heat pumps to 5 per cent. This would offer consumers a 15 per cent discount on current prices, creating greater demand certainty and encouraging manufacturers to invest in innovation. In the long term, this would not cost the Exchequer. VAT on gas boilers is 20 per cent but they are at least four times cheaper than a heat pump. The average gross VAT paid on a boiler sale at 20 per cent or a heat pump sale at 5 per cent would be approximately equal. As gas boilers are gradually phased out for heat pumps, VAT receipts should remain at roughly the same level.At the same time, ministers should introduce a boiler scrappage scheme, echoing car scrappage schemes offered by the likes of Birmingham City Council. This would offer a discretionary cash amount to households to replace their gas boiler with a heat pump. While the Treasury will worry about deadweight cost, scrappage schemes are one of the most consumer friendly ways for governments to shift consumer behaviour.Ministers could also make a proportion of the cost of installing a heat pump tax deductible. In Finland, up to €3,000 of the installation costs of a heat pump can be deducted from personal taxation. This is why nearly 40 per cent of Finnish households now own a heat pump, and they continue to be installed in one in 40 households per year – 20 times the rate in the UK. Our report estimates that a similar scheme – with £5,000 of the installation costs made tax-deductible – would cost just 0.3 per cent of income tax receipts each year, even at the rate of installation seen in Finland.As demand increases, the market should respond by developing better and cheaper heat pumps. But that alone will not solve the problem, given the dire shortage of trained installers. In the UK today, there are only 1,200 tradespeople capable of installing a heat pump according to EY. Heat pumps typically take weeks to install using a small team of plumbers, but this workforce would need to install two heat pumps a day, 365 days a year, to meet the 600,000 target a year target.This makes it vital for the Government to invest in training now, through new apprenticeship routes and by amending plumbing training standards, to ensure the UK has the domestic workers capable of upgrading people’s homes. The recent HGV driver shortage is a cautionary tale.The Prime Minister has made a big bet on heat pumps. It will not pay off unless he’s prepared to back his play with the policies to propel demand, galvanise investment and drive innovation.Alex Luke is a researcher at OnwardMore from NewsNortherners were sitting ducks for Covid-19Brexit latest news: Leo Varadkar warns world leaders against striking deals with the UK until they are confident ministers will \u0026#39keep their promises\u0026#39If DVLA staff don\u0026#39t get a grip, we face a Christmas without presentsSculptor calls in lawyer to save Hong Kong Tiananmen statuePolice \u0026#39canteen culture\u0026#39 in WhatsApp groups can lead to officers \u0026#39abusing their position for sexual purposes\u0026#39Why Norway leads the world for electric cars - and what the UK can learnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"natural history museums wildlife photographer year competition","story":"The winners of the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year were announced last night at the Natural History Museum during a virtual Awards ceremony.The spider room by Gil Wizen, IsraelCanada Winner, Urban Wildlife Gil Wizen (IsraelCanada) finds a venomous Brazilian wandering spider hiding under his bed.

The study, from the cross-party Science and Technology Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee, said the UK’s preparation for a pandemic was far too focused on flu, while ministers waited too long to push through lockdown measures in early . In a wide-ranging report, MPs said the UK’s pandemic planning was too “narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model” that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. Here are eight key findings from the report:Preparedness The Governmentaposs pandemic planning was too narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. The national risk register predicted that the likelihood of an emerging infectious disease spreading within the UK was lower than that of a flu pandemic, with only up to  people dying. The report recommended that experts from abroad should help draw up plans while specialists should scan the horizon for future threats. Army logistics experts should play a more central role in preparing for pandemics. Herd immunity While allowing people to become infected early on to reach herd immunity was not an official Government strategy, there was a policy approach of fatalism about the spread of the virus. This led to a strategy of only trying to moderate the speed of infection through the population - flattening the curve - rather than stopping its spread. SAGE experts believed completely suppressing the virus would cause a second peak.Lockdowns Ministers took a gradual and incremental approach to restrictions such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns and MPs said it was astonishing that it took so long for them to realise this was a catastrophically wrong decision that would dramatically increase the death toll. There was a  belief the public would not accept a lockdown and lack of testing meant there was little data on Covid spread. Ministers ignored scientic advice for a two-week circuit breaker in autumn which could have saved thousands of lives and meant there was a month-long lockdown - apart from schools - in November instead. The PM announced a third lockdown on January  . Restrictions The Government was too slow to bring in self-isolation rules while light-touch border controls only on countries with high Covid rates meant the arrival of more cases from countries like France and Spain. Regional tiers brought in last October were not watertight enough to prevent infection spreading. Scientic evidence for measures like the pm curfew on pubs was lacking. Tougher social distancing measures last autumn could have stopped the spread of the Alpha iant across the country and saved more lives.  Social care Social care had a less prominent voice in Government in the early stages of the pandemic than did the NHS. The decision not to test people being discharged from hospitals to care homes early on was a failure and led to deaths in care homes. Staff shortages, the lack of testing and dficulties in obtaining PPE all hampered isolation and infection control. The social care sector remains drastically in need of funding and reform - or it will be at risk from future pandemics. Health inequalities There were unacceptably high death rates among people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, the MPs concluded. Increased exposure to Covid as a result of peopleaposs housing and working conditions played a signicant role. BAME staff in the NHS, often in more junior positions, faced greater dficulty getting appropriate PPE equipment. There were also disproportionately high mortality rates among people with learning dficulties and autism - in part because of pre-existing health conditions but also dficulties accessing care. The experience of the covid pandemic underlines the need for an urgent and long term strategy to tackle health inequalities, they concluded.  Testing The slow, uncertain, and often chaotic performance of the £ billion test, trace and isolate system severely hampered the UKaposs response to the pandemic, the MPs found. Test and trace failed in its stated objective to prevent future lockdowns - despite vast quantities of taxpayersapos money. The report concluded were it not for the NHS vaccines programme further lockdown restrictions would have been needed in summer . Vaccines MPs praised ministers for identying that a vaccine would be a long-term route out of the pandemic and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance for setting up the Vaccines Taskforce to procure jabs. The Government was right to support vaccine research and development, including the Oxford AstraZeneca jab, while the NHS successfully handled the roll-out of the programme, with over % of the adult population jabbed by September . But the conclusion that the vaccine programme has redeemed many of the Governmentaposs other failings - which resulted in , deaths - will be controversial.

The Local Government Association blamed the “chronic shortage of affordable homes” for delays in finding families accommodation. It feared council housing waiting lists could rocket to as many as . million households because of the impact of Covid-related support schemes winding down and a potential surge in homelessness. In a report ahead of this month’s Budget, the LGA, the Association of Retained Council Housing and the National Federation of Arms-Length Management Organisations outlined plans to build , “green social homes” for rent each year.  But it called for the powers and cash from Whitehall to be able to hit the target.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter LGA housing spokesman David Renard said: “There is a desperate need to build more social housing in this country, which should be a central part of the Government’s ambition to level-up and build back better following the pandemic. “Social housing gives families the security and stability of a decent home, as well as being a route to owning your own home through Right to Buy. “Now is the time to reverse the decline in council housing over the past few decades.  The benefits are clear – a programme of , social homes a year would shorten council housing waiting lists, reduce homelessness and cut carbon emissions, while delivering a multi-billion, long-term boost to the economy. “Councils stand ready to work with the Government to tackle our housing crisis, but need the powers to build homes with the right infrastructure on this scale in the Spending Review.” Housing charity Shelter said that “over a million families are stuck on social housing waiting lists with no ideathey’ll ever get the keys to a secure home they can afford”. Chief executive Polly Neate added: “Unless the new Housing Secretary gets a grip on the housing crisis, it will only get worse as soaring energy costs, rising evictions, and cuts to Universal Credit really start hurting families.”  Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: “This research should be a wakeup call for the Government to face the reality that people experiencing homelessness and those at risk are paying the price for our continued failure to build the number of social homes we need. “Behind these escalating figures are people forced to travel miles to take their children to school because theyaposve had to be relocated away from their support networks, others trying to hold down a job while they move from one sofa to the next, then there are those living with the constant worry of how they will afford their rent and heat their homes when each day brings further financial pressure.“Enough is enough. If we really want to rebuild a society and economy that works for everyone then building safe and genuinely affordable homes must be at the heart of this. Only this bold action will see us finally end homelessness for good.”  NFA chairwoman Sarita-Marie Rehman Wall said the “struggle to find a good home, and a home you can afford, is now very real and very tough for millions of people”. She added: “Our national housing shortage isn’t just hitting one small group, it is creating hardship for all kinds of people in all walks of le - whether we’re talking about young people just heading out into adult or family le, or older people whose income drops at the very time when their need for support and the right kind of home increases.” A Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities spokeswoman said: “We are building more social housing and taking action to reduce waiting lists, which have fallen by almost , households since . “We’ve delivered over , affordable homes for rent, including , for social rent. “But we must go further, so we’re investing over £billion in affordable housing over the next five years - the largest investment in affordable housing in a decade.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HomelessnessHousingPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Professor Christina Pagel - director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at UCL, and member of Independent SAGE The House of Commons report on the lessons learned to date on Coronavirus is damning on the UK response. On the initial response in , the report highlighted four main failings. Those were: ignoring the advice and experience from the WHO and other countries where Covid hit first. Instead of scaling up our testing capacity we reduced it, so we didn’t know where and how it was spreading. We made assumptions about what level of response the British public would accept, which were not based on any evidence and turned out to be entirely wrong.  And finally, we didn’t set up a test, trace and isolate system until too late. Even once we did, it was never particularly effective. Instead of preventing infections in the first place, the focus was almost entirely on managing hospital capacity once people got sick. This did nothing to stop spread in the early stages and later led to the terrible decision to discharge elderly patients to care homes without a test, seeding Covid throughout the care home sector and resulting in thousands of deaths. In the end, despite all the advantages we had, the UK set itself up to fail in containing the pandemic, with a sense of fatalism that somehow this was all inevitable. As the report made clear, it was not.  Professor Devi Sridhar - chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh In other countries, the leadership has taken responsibility for the failings of their response to Covid-. Weaposve seen both the Swedish and the Japanese prime ministers resigning over Covid mistakes. Weaposve seen Donald Trump punished at the ballot box with Covid being the top electoral issue in the US. We live in a democracy, so itaposs up for people to look at their leadership and question whether we have the kind of leadership we want. The report is pretty clear and comprehensive on where the UK fell down. It goes into strategy, it goes into implementation and exceptionalism. And it does highlight, in quite a balanced and fair way, where mistakes are made and where improvements need to be made for the future. A positive thing is that we live in a country where MPs are able to distance themselves enough to recognise what went wrong.  Now we need to look at whataposs needed for the next crisis. Iaposm very convinced by the  Day Mission, which aims to have diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics ready to go within  days of a new outbreak. With mRNA vaccine technology, new vaccines can be sequenced and manufactured in a weekend, and then just need to be trialled and distributed. The likelihood is we in the UK are seeing Covid- receding into the background. We might have a bumpy winter but barring a new ient, by the spring we should be feeling in quite a good position with the effective vaccines and boosters rolled out. Poorer countries are probably one to two years behind us so we need to work out how to get enough vaccines to enough people around the world. Science will usually come up with a solution, itaposs just a question of finding enough time to allow those solutions to come forward.

Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said the Government was sorry for failures in the handling of the virus and admitted ministers would do some things dferently with hindsight.A devastating report by MPs said the , deaths in the first wave could have been halvedBoris Johnson had locked down earlier last March.Bereaved families reacted with fury to the report by the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, which listed a string of errors ranging from late lockdowns to Test and Trace failings. And Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay stoked anger further by repeatedly refusing to apologise in a series of interviews.  The Prime Minister has not commented on the findings - as heaposs currently sunning himself in Spain with his family. Pictures emerged of Mr Johnson painting at an easel as he relaxed at a luxury hideaway outside Marbella owned by Tory peer Zac Goldsmith. Mr Dowden finally offered an apology for the errors in the Governmentaposs response after being pressed by Sky News. He said: The PM apologised earlier this year for all the hurt and distress that all those families have suffered and I share that and I offer that as well. Itaposs been a terrible time for every family affected by this terrible virus.I welcome this report. Itaposs a very good report by Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt. The government will, as we do with all these reports, be fully analysing it and giving a full response to the recommendations.  Pressed again to apologise, he said: Yes of course Iaposm sorry, as the PM is sorry. I was just listening to the kind of experiences yesterday of those bereaved families and that kind of terrible loss they suffered and so many people have suffered, not just in this country but around the world from the Covid crisis. He added: Weaposre sorry for the losses that all those families have suffered. But he said the pandemic unprecedented crisis, itaposs a once in a hundred years event, adding: We would do some things dferently with hindsight. Mr Dowden also defended the PMaposs decision to take a Spanish holiday while Brits face a cost of living crisis. He told Good Morning Britain: Iaposve worked closely with three prime ministers and I can assure you that thereaposs no such thing as a holiday for a prime minister. I know the Prime Minister will be and is working out there and is engaged with issues going on in the UK. But also, I hope your viewers will appreciate that the Prime Minister has been through a challenging time in a lot of dferent ways - he had Covid-, heaposs got a new child on the way, and very sadly he lost his mother just a few weeks ago. So this is a just a short break and he will be ing to the UK and I am expecting to see him later this week.

He is understood to have been asked to step down from his role as commander of charity” following the events. But he has escaped censure from the Tories, who will not suspend him from the party. Mr Gray mixed up Iraq-born Mr Zahawi, who wears glasses and has a beard, and clean-shaven Mr Javid, whose family hails from Pakistan. When his error was pointed out, Mr Gray allegedly told guests: “They all look the same to me”. Mr Gray denied saying thisFty invited guests - who included Labour leader Keir Starmer - had been watching Mr Gray onstage, according to MailOnline.Mr Zahawi was reportedly spoke to him privately afterwards, while Mr Javid had not arrived when the incident took place. A St John Ambulance spokesman told the Mirror: “St John does not tolerate racism in any way, shape or form. “We spoke with James Gray following the event about our values as an open, inclusive and progressive charity.” It is understood that the charity has now asked the MP to stand down from all St John Ambulance activity. Mr Gray failed to respond to requests for comment from the Mirror.He told MailOnline he had not said, “They all look the same to me”, but admitted confusing the two ministers.He added: “I said, ‘I am sorry to confuse the two of you. You two look very alike’. I said, ‘I am sorryI got you two mixed up’.” A source told the newspaper: He acknowledged to the audience that his comments werenapost appropriate but in a low-key, jokey way. They added that many of the volunteers were upset. A Conservative Party spokesperson said: These comments were misjudged. We do not tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind. It comes after Mr Gray was forced to apologise last month for suggesting a bomb should be planted in a Labour MPaposs office. He said he meant no offence with the comment about Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds, which that he posted in a WhatsApp group ahead of Labour conference in Brighton.

Currently the worst placed is Trafford, in Greater Manchester, which has the highest rate of infection in the country with , new cases in the seven days to October . It has been creeping up in the area and now broken the , barrier with the equivalent of . people catching the virus per ,. This is up sharply from . people in the seven days to October  and so the area not only has the highest number of cases currently but it also has one of the biggest rises in infections.  Helen Gollins, acting director of public health for Trafford told the BBC there had been a “signicant” increase recently, especially in the -to- age group. New measures that included asking pupils and staff to wear masks were brought in on Monday. Our vaccination levels are high but we still need to make sure those people who havenapost yet had both vaccinations get their vaccines, Ms Gollins told the BBC.  The figures, for the seven days to October , are based on the number of people who have tested positive for Covid- in either a lab-reported or rapid lateral flow test, by specimen date. Of the  local areas in the UK, have seen a week-on-week rise in rates and only have seen a fall.  It comes as Boris Johnson is under pressure to bring forward a public enquiry into the handing of the pandemic after a joint probe by the Commons health and science committees found ministers made a serious error in their approach to the lockdown last year.In the first major probe into how the government has tackled the pandemic, experts said that shutting down a week earlier than March , , would have cut the , death toll in the first wave “by at least half”.  The report by the Commons health and science committees branded the delay one of the most important public health failures the UK had ever suffered.

Mat Wheelhouse, , crossed the finish line at the Manchester City Centre on Sunday morning having completed the .kmcourse in four hours and  minutes. But he had actually not signed up for the full marathon and had incorrectly thought he was taking part in a half-marathon.After becoming hooked on running during lockdown, Mat signed up for the Manchester half marathon to raise money for the Christie Hospital in memory of his late father, reports the Manchester Evening News. Both races took place on Sunday but Mat missed the half marathon due to a “stupid mistake” and found himself in a queue full of runners preparing for the full marathon.  Up till race day he had only been training with km and km runs, with the furthest distance heaposd run being just km. He said: When I got my number through the post I must have looked at the wrong guide and noted the start time for the full marathon instead of the half. I just assumed they started around the same time so I didnapost really think any more of it. Despite noticing that other runners were carrying rucksacks with drinks and snacks, Mat only realised his mistake when he joined the queue and saw he was the only person with a half marathon sticker on his top.  I thought something didnapost seem quite right, he said. “Then I started seeing streams of people coming in who had just finished the half marathon.” Deciding he didn’t want to let down the people who had sponsored him, he decided to run anway. “I was so embarrassed because lots of people had sponsored me and I didn’t want to let them down so I went to the information desk and told them what had happened. The woman said she could try and change my number and let me run in the marathon and then just dip out half way through. But I wanted to make sure I got the medal and I thoughtI don’t finish I wonapost get it, so I just decided to carry on running.” Mat ran the entire marathon on his own, whilst his unassuming we was working and his two daughters were at home, and without music for the second half after his Air Pods ran out of charge. He added: ”It was very painful towards the end. I think the last five miles were incredibly hard. The public were amazing though. I have never seen that amount of people out on the streets. I remember at one point bending over to catch my breath and I must have been patted on the back about  times. The comradery was amazing. Mat said he is well known for “doing this kind of thing” and that his most recent misadventure has become a joke among his friends. “Everyone has said this is the most Wheelhouse thing you could do. I am always doing stupid things. My family was proud of me though. My daughter had made me a well done banner for when I got home which was lovely. ”I think I might try and do a marathon again next year but knowing me I will probably end up signing up to the wrong thing and doing a triathlon or something.”You can donate to Mataposs fundraising pagehere.Comment MORE ON CharitiesFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After a private scan, a mass was found on his brain and he was sent for further examinations which took days to complete alone in the hospital. He after being released from hospital, he was sadly diagnosed with a stage  Dfuse Midline Glioma brain tumour that it aggressive and inoperable. At the end of June, Pali began three weeks of advanced radiotherapy. Paliaposs family are now searching for alternatives as the tumour is resistant to conventional treatment, and they are hoping to raise money for an expensive trial drug and immunotherapy in Germany. Paliaposs older sister, Kiren Sirha, said: Pali is our world, he is the rock of our family as a father, husband, son, brother and dear friend to so many.  He has a heart of gold and never fails to put others before himself, he is our inspiration every day, we are so proud of him. It has become challenging for us to see our beloved Pali endure weeks of radiotherapy and the side effects that have followed.She added:Itaposs been a hard journey for the last few months. Itaposs devastating. Heaposs  and he has a young family.Heaposs my younger brother, but weaposre all young - itaposs been a big shock. Those  weeks were the most gruelling any of us have ever experienced and the effects of radiotherapy have hit Pali hard.  Upon research and conferring with oncologists, Pali and family were told trial drug ONC could be the most effective treatment for his specic tumour as well as an immunotherapy treatment in Germany. However, Kiren said they were told ONC could not be funded by the NHS, and his family are trying to raise the funds for the treatment themselves. ONC costs £, a month, and must be used long-termit is effective. Immunotherapy in Germany could cost around £, per treatment. The family is therefore hoping to raise £, for Pali. Kiren said: Weaposll do anything we can for him. Weaposre going to get him the treatment no matter what. But thereaposs so many people out there who wonapost be able to do this. Itaposs a heart-breaking and emotional journey, but weaposre doing anything and everything we can.  Dr Phil Wood, Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Executive at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “We are sorry to hear about Mr Uppal’s experience. We always strive to deliver the highest quality care and to find ways to improve our services through patient feedback. If Mr Uppal and his family would like to contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service we can work with them to address their concerns.”The GoFundMe page for Paliaposs treatment can be found here.As of Friday October , £, had already been raised towards Paliaposs target.

Susan Cotter, , has cared for her grandchildren Jessica, Taylor, Kyle and Millie since her daughter Charlene developed a drug problem and passed away earlier this year. She says she feels abandoned by the system and that her efforts to get a bigger house have received little more than sympathy from authorities. She sleeps on a single bed in the living room of her home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, with her -year-old grandson on the floor, while his ,  and eight-year-old sisters share the small bedrooms.Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror.She told GlasgowLive : “I’m quite a quiet woman and don’t make a fuss about things, but I’ve had no support for myself or these children. There’s nobody helping me, all I get is sympathy but nothing actually done about it.”With Christmas approaching, she faces another year of being unable to offer her grandchildren some much-needed festive joy. After appeals to housing officials, her MP, Glasgow City Council and even the childrenaposs social worker failed, Susan turned to the local paper for help. She said: “I haven’t been able to buy anything for Christmas for the last couple years, apart from anything , there’s just no space in this house. It’s really getting to me. “We have just been left to cope on our own. Where is the care for vulnerable children  Every year is the same and I’m running out of hope. I’ve got a lot of physical problems as well. I am under the shielding category and the children have missed so much school time and had no help with catching up. I’ve wondered how long I can keep my spirits up. The children have a social worker, but it doesn’t seem to help, it’s only sympathy. I need practical help. It just goes on and on. I’m angry and I’m frustrated.” GlasgowLive contacted Susanaposs local councillor Malcolm Balfour who was unaware of her plight and horried to learn sheaposd been offered little help. He has since met with her to see what can be done, but is outraged at the lack of apparent support sheaposs received so far. He said: “Susan is doing a brilliant job raising the children in really dficult circumstances, but it hasnapost been easy for any of them. It would be so easy for them to fall into the same trap as their mum and theyaposre working really hard to stop that from happening. One of the girls is studying for her Highers, she wants to go to university to train to be a midwe, sheaposs a clever and ambitious girl with dreams. It was suggested that she get a place of her own, can you imagine what that would do to that girl, sheaposd never get the chance to fulfil that dream. This family has been through enough, they need practical support, not kind words. He added that he had discussed the situation with Susan’s landlord, Drumchapel Housing Co-operative, and was stunned to learn they canapost help because their biggest properties only have three bedrooms. He added: Itaposs just unbelievable, her family is too big for the biggest house they have, so sheaposs expected just to say in a smaller one. They tell me there are legal reasons for this, but it is just unacceptable. This family needs and deserves our support and theyaposre just not getting it, itaposs not good enough.

Her parents were originally expected toto Britain to have their four-month-old baptised at Windsor Castle like their son Archie, two.But a palace insider has told thethat a UK christening “is not happening”.Instead, Lilibet is likely to be christened into the Episcopal Church of the US, a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion.  The decision would make a break in tradition and make Lilibet the first of the Queen’s grandchildren or great-grandchildren not to receive a royal baptism within the church of England. It would also mean that it would be unlikely that the Queen, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would attend, according to royal biographer Ingrid Seward.She told The Sun thatLilibet is christening in the United States, “maybe” Harry’s friends would fly out.She added: “I don’t think any members of the immediate Royal Family would have time [to fly over]. Their schedules are organised six months in advance.”  If she is baptised in Calornia, Lilibet would not automatically be considered a member of the Church of England, unless she came to Britain and joined a CofE congregation. Anyone can say they are a member of the Church of Englandthey worship in a CofE church and are not a member of an incompatible religion. It would have no effect on Lilibetaposs standing in the line of succession. Princess Eugenie would be an “obvious” choice for Lilibet’s godmother, as the -year-old has remained close to the Sussexes and recently lent her support to Meghanaposs X Archewell mentorship programme.  Zara or Mike Tindall are also possible godparent choices, Ingrid said, adding that Lilibet would likely have American godparents as Meghan has “obviously got lots and lots of American friends”. Among them, “speculation is re” that Oprah Winfrey could be asked to become Lilibet’s godmother, after hosting the couple’s explosive interview earlier this year. Meghan’s friends Jessica Mulroney, Benita Litt, Jessica’s daughter Ivy and Benita’s daughters Rylan and Remi are also in the running. But the royal expert added she would be “very surprised”the couple chose to hold the christening in the US. She said: “Harry’s great-grandmother is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England - and Meghan was inducted into the Church of England. “If they wanted, Harry and Meghan could have it privately in the Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Queen is not going to say no, she may not be able to be there herself but she’s not going to say they can’t have it there. “The only reason [it wouldnapost be held in the UK] would beMeghan didnapost want to come over here with the baby. That would be the only reason I could think of.”  Either way, the Sussexes are famously particular about their privacy and unlikely to release details about their daughter’s baptism. If they do decide to stay in America, they may not publicly announce the date or details about the ceremony. Ingrid said: “If it happens in the UK obviously people will find out, butit happens [in Calornia], I don’t know that there will be any official announcement. “They’ll have their own Vogue cameraman there, there will definitely be photos but they may not release any.” Comment MORE ON Prince HarryOprah WinfreyRoyal FamilyMeghan MarkleLilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Clare Nadia Childes, , was found dead at home on March  two hours after having a telephone consultation with Dr Gwilym Evans. At an inquest into Mrs Childeaposs death in Caernarfon, Wales, Dr Evans said he was hesitant to refer the mum-of-three to a mental health crisis team because she was intoxicated.Dr Evans - who said he was concerned for Mrs Childeaposs wellbeing at the time - added that with hindsight he would have made an immediate referral, North Wales Live reports.On the day of her death, Mrs Childes had drunk a large bottle of alchol and told her sonaposs girlfriend Llinos Packam - who lived at the same property - she was struggling to cope. Ms Packham advised the mum-of-three to call her GP and Dr Evans responded to her with a callback within  minutes. Dr Evans told the hearing: I had never spoken to Clare before that day but I could hear tension in her voice.She told me she was stressed, felt very unwell and was thinking about killing herself.She numbered problems with her personal le including her drinking, that she was smoking cannabis every day, had financial troubles, had lost her father and had a breakdown in the relationship with her partner. She also said that lockdown had made her feel more unwell.I was concerned for her and told her I would speak to the mental health team and said Iaposd give her a ring tomorrow.She told me she might hang herself later on that evening but I was concerned that the mental health team would decline to see her because she had been drinking so I said I would ring her back as soon as I could. After the conversation, Ms Packham said she tried to comfort the -year-old by telling her to focus on her grandchildren. She left the property after Mrs Childes told her she would not harm herself.Miss Packham said: I reminded her that she had a grandson and a granddaughter on the way and that she should try to concentrate on that.She told me she wasnapost going to do anything and I told her to call meshe needed me.Mc Packham ed home  minutes later and found Mrs Childes hanging and unresponsive. She then called the emergency services who pronounced her dead at the scene. Before her death Mrs Childes had been crying and saying she couldnapost cope and felt she wasnapost fit to be a grandmother, her daughter, Kimberley Childes, said in a statement.She said: She had a history of poor mental health which worsened during lockdown.After Christmas she went downhill.Mam begged the doctor to do something but she was told to wait until the next day.I never imagined she would do something like this.She loved going out and socialising and will be sadly missed by family and friends.At the inquest, Dr Evans said he had taken a suicide prevention training course after hearing of Mrs Childeaposs death. Following the incident, Dr Evans has given presentations on how the mental health reporting system could be improved. He saidhe faced the same situation again, he would make the referral straight away now. At the time I was concerned about the presentation of Clare as she told me she had drank a lot and I was concerned they would not be willing to accept a referralshe was under the influence of alcohol, he added. He didnapost believe her to be in immediate crisis, because she hadnapost indicated she might take her le immediately. Dr Evans also said he wanted to wait until the effects of the alcohol had worn off. The doctor said he called her back at .pm but the call went straight to voicemail. Concluding that Mrs Childes had died as a result of hanging, acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland said she was struggling with financial concerns, her alcohol intake and relationship breakdown. Though a referral was not made to the crisis team, Ms Sutherland said the process of being referred was in Mrs Childeaposs mind at the time of her death. She was then left alone for  minutes before being found at .pm, Ms Sutherland adds. Although she had a supportive family, Mrs Childes was clearly troubled for a long time despite the support around her, Ms Sutherland concluded. The coroner has now requested more evidence to determine whether or not to make a Preventing Future Deaths report.

The pair married in a grand ceremony at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in  with her ied guest list including her grandmother the Queen, supermodel Cara Delevigne and singer Robbie Williams.In fact, more than  people packed into the chapel exactly three years ago to see Eugenie and Jack exchange their vows.Butyou look closely enough at pictures from the day you can see one prime seat at the front of the chapel in front of the Queen was left empty. However, it wasnapost down to a no-show on the big day - it is actually down to the Queen herself. Thataposs because traditionally the Queen and the rest of the royals sit on the right-hand-side of the quire in St Georgeaposs Chapel.Her Majesty is said to prefer to sit in the second row of seats, as, according to The Sun, she finds the front row uncomfortable.

Click here to sign up .And with tradition dictating that no one is allowed to sit in front of the Queen and obstruct her view - this is why the seat was left empty.The same seat was also left empty months earlier when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married in the same chapel. However, there was actually a member of the royal family missing on Eugenieaposs wedding day - the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, she attended a school harvest festival in Scotland, which she had agreed to make an appearance at before Eugenieaposs wedding date had been confirmed.Since marrying in , Eugenie and Jack have moved into Frogmore Cottage in Windsor and earlier this year welcomed their first child - a son called August Philip. And in a sweet moment in a documentary that aired last month honouring Eugenieaposs late grandfather Prince Philip, she revealed young August got to meet his great-grandfather shortly before his death in April.August was born on February  this year and holding back the tears, Eugenie explained: We named August, August Philip because grandpa has been such a huge, inspiring character in my le. I brought little August to come and meet him and told him that we had named him after him and it was such a lovely moment. We were very lucky to do that. Last month, Eugenie also became an aunt for the first time after her sister Princess Beatrice gave birth to a daughter she named Sienna Elizabeth.

Bobby has spent most of his le locked away in a tiny crate wearing a shock collar to stop him barking - but has since been freed and is now undergoing rehabilitation. The team at the Barn Animal Rescue in Newtownards, Co Down, are getting the loveable Springer-Jack Russell Terrier cross back up to peak condition so he can eventually get a new forever home.His carers are currently working to help him strength his back legs with swimming lessons alongside the team from Vet Rehab NI, reports BelfastLive. And to make sure he is settled in his new surroundings he is allowed to investigate the hydrotherapy suite, including working out who the other dog is in his reflection. Joanne Ford from The Barn said: Little Bobby will sleep well tonight after his first hydrotherapy session at Vet Rehab NI. Bobby is the sweetest, friendliest eight-month-old Springer   Jack Russell Terrier cross who came into us a couple of weeks ago. He has spent his whole le in a tiny crate with a shock collar on.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Due to this he cannot stand properly and his back legs are very weak he spends most of the time crawling on his tummy or dragging his back legs behind him. It was heartbreaking seeing him like this. We decided to help him along and try to make sure he is as fit and healthy as possible for his new home by building up his muscles with hydro. Susan was fantastic and so gentle and caring towards Bobby and really made our first visit very enjoyable. We highly recommend them and will use them again for any of our other dogs that need help.

Allie Marsh, , says she often receives negative comments because she is taller than her boyfriend Gustavo Hernandez, . The pair share a seven-inch height dference, with Allie measuring aposaposapos and Gustavo measuring aposaposapos. Allie, a university student, has been in a relationship with Gustavo, a customer service representative, since May and claims height has never been a problem for her. The woman, from North Carolina in the US, said: Heaposs in a band called Omerta and my friend sent me some of their music and I loved what I heard so I started out as a fan. I saw Gustavo and started plotting meeting him so I followed him on Instagram and he followed me back and it went from there.My friend told me he was only aposaposapos so I knew how short he was before anything even happened. The first time I saw a photo of him, my first thought was I want him and the more I got to know him, the more attracted I became to him. Height has never been a standard of mine - my ex was shorter than me as well by three inches. Height is something that canapost be helped and from the beginning to this day, all I care about is that Iaposm in a healthy, happy relationship with someone I see a future with.  The pair met after Allie became a fan of his band and hit it off on Instagram. Since then, Allie has faced comments from trolls online about their height dference. She added: Weaposre in a long-distance relationship so we havenapost had too many opportunities to go out in public so we havenapost experienced any comments while weaposre out and about. But, I have had to mute notications online because some comments do provoke me. I purposefully keep the details of our relationship offline so thereaposs no way anyone is qualied to give an opinion about us. She added: We have a solid group of friends who are happy for us and that support our relationship so Iaposm never alone in the fight. Heaposs used to negative comments about his height and itaposs not something that bothers him. Iaposve never been inconvenienced by his height in any way and it doesnapost make him any less of a person - I wouldnapost change a thing about him. Allie is hoping to break the stereotype and show women it is okay to date shorter men. She said: Height doesnapost make a man - his actions and mannerisms do. I think women who only date taller men do a huge disservice to themselves because it closes them off. If you purely refuse someoneaposs advances because of their height, itaposs proof of how shallow you are. People have said Iaposve lowered my standards by choosing to date Gustavo, but it could not be more . Heaposs shown me so much love and compassion since the day we met and has never taken me for granted. He thinks itaposs badass that he has a girlfriend taller than him! I can reach the things that he normally canapost and it means thereaposs more of me to love as well.

Just this year, one unlucky couple claimed to have missed out on no less than £million after their card payment didnapost go through. Previously, unknowing winners have even binned their tickets, while one woman unwisely blew thousands after mistakenly thinking sheaposd scooped the jackpot. Couple miss £m jackpot as card declined Rachel Kennedy, , and Liam McCrohan, , were left “absolutely heartbroken” in March after claiming theyaposd missed out on a £million EuroMillions jackpot. The couple, from Hertfordshire, realised their usual numbers of , , , , ,  and  had come up but there was one major catch - their ticket payment hadnapost gone through. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersThey had played the same numbers for five weeks in a row, before all seven digits appeared in the draw. Rachel explained how she had set up her account to automatically buy a EuroMillions ticket for each draw - but when payment for the winning ticket was attempted, the lottery account did not have enough funds.Checking her account after the draw, she was greeted with a message saying her numbers were a winning match - however, her heart sank when she realised the glitch, The Sun reported. Rachel, a business student at Brighton University, said: I called my boyfriend Liam and my mum into the room and they couldnapost believe it either so I was like, aposoh my god I need to call themapos.  I called the number thinking that I had won £million and they said aposyeah youaposve got the right numbers but you didnapost have the funds in your account for the payment of the ticket so it didnapost actually go throughapos. I was on top of the world when I thought I had won, but when I found out I hadnapost, Liam was actually more upset than me. Rachel said they were absolutely heartbroken - and now thinks of her usual weekly numbers as unlucky and has decided to change them. Camelot, which has operated the UKaposs state-franchised national lottery since its establishment in , has wished Rachel the best of luck in future draws. A company spokesman added: Weaposre aware of Rachelaposs story and hope she gets in early to buy a ticket for the next big draw. Marriage breaks down after losing £m ticket It took Martyn and Kay Tott six months to realise they had won over £million on the National Lottery back in . The massive realisation finally dawned on the Totts, from Watford, after they spotted an appeal for the winner to come forward.  There was, however, one big problem – they had lost the winning ticket. Dubbed ‘the unluckiest couple in Britain’, Martyn and Kay were able to prove via computer records they were telling the truth and the case soon gained national attention.Sir Richard Branson and even Tony Blair spoke out in support, but, without the actual winning ticket, they were unable to collect a single penny of their fortune.Sadly, the coupleaposs marriage later broke down, but Martyn eventually explained he was glad he didnapost win.Having that money taken away was torture, he told the Mail on Sunday.  For a long time I lost sight of who I was and what I believed in. But I can honestly say I’m glad I didn’t get the £million now. There is no guarantee it would have brought me happiness. Pals furious after binning m ticket Two friends in America threw a million-winning US Powerball ticket in the trash. Salvatore Cambria and Erik Onyango of New York later tried to sue the Lottery Commission of New Jersey, the neighbouring state where they regularly went to buy their tickets.  The pair decided to throw the ticket out after checking the winning numbers on the New Jersey lottery website in . Unfortunately, they were checking their numbers against the wrong results as the website had not yet been updated. It wasn’t until the following day the pair realised they had actually won, by which time, as their lawyer put it, “their money was headed to a garbage dump somewhere in Canada. Woman goes on shopping spree thinking sheaposs won Itaposs one thing realising youaposve just missed out on the big prize - and another mistakenly assuming youaposve won. Back in , a delighted lottery player in France reportedly splurged thousands of Euros on clothes, jewellery and perfumes after believing sheaposd scooped a huge EuroMillions jackpot.The woman - whose identity was not disclosed - wrote out cheques for her expensive purchases, believing she would be covered by her winnings, according to Lottery.Unfortunately, after splashing out more than €,, her husband pointed out that one of the digits didnapost match those in the draw. In an attempt to avoid criminal proceedings, the woman tried to claim her handbag had been stolen and that she hadnapost written the cheques at all - but was foiled by CCTV footage. She was hauled before a French court, which gave her a four month suspended sentence as well as community service and an order to repay her debts in instalments Plumber left m ticket behind pipe Staten Island plumber Anthony Perosi left a winning lottery ticket stashed behind a basement pipe for six weeks before realising he had won million. Anthony had all but forgotten about it until word spread that an unclaimed winning ticket had been traced back to the same store where he made his purchase in . Suddenly remembering, he headed to the basement where he found the ticket pinned behind a pipe. It was only then that he realised he was in fact the lucky winner.  “I tried to breathe in and nothing would go in,” he told the New York Times.“I thought I was having a heart attack and my heart stopped. So I grabbed the ticket, figuring they would find it in my hand.” Fortunately, Anthony was able to claim the prize and decided to split the winnings - with his son.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON EuromillionsNational Lottery\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said this is considered a aposjerk moveapos, butyou get on an elevator and want to be alone then all you have to do is keep the button held down and no one will be able to get on. What do you think about the manaposs advice  Let us know in the commentsIn the video, the man said: Oh they work, youaposre just using them incorrectly. So what happens is you get in the elevator and the door shuts, you hold the button and keep it held down. Basically the door canapost open until that button is released. Soyou want to be on the elevator alone just hold that button down and no one gets to get on with you until you let go of the button. Jerk move, but once you have that power never let it go.

Tee Barlett said she assumed as a teenager that all women had two vagina openings. When she was  she found out the truth after she asked her mum which hole a tampon needed to go in, prompting a doctoraposs visit. Tee was formally diagnosed with a vaginal septum at  and now raises awareness of the condition on social media. The now -year-old said: I didnapost really communicate with mum about awkward topics back then. One day, I was having a conversation with my best friend and mum, and I finally asked which hole a tampon was supposed to go in, the left or the right.  Mum looked at me like aposwhat apos. At first, she said that there werenapost two holes and we argued for a little bit, and I was being really defensive. She then suggested that we go to the doctors. Thataposs when I realised, she was being serious and that there really is not supposed to be two openings down there. The two doctors disregarded everything that I was saying and made me feel crazy. The second doctor looked at it, then looked back at me and said, aposNah itaposs normalapos and she sort of pushed us out the door.  I left there somewhat flabbergasted. I was nuts thinking that I had two vaginas. I was starting to feel like I was going crazy. I was second-guessing myself. The high ropes instructor then went to a third doctor who referred her to a gynaecologist - and they confirmed she did have two vaginal openings. Tee, from New South Wales, Australia, was warned that her double vagina would likely make sexual intercourse and giving birth dficult and potentially dangerous. She underwent surgery to remove the septum at .  She said: I did research and found out that you could get someone stuck inside you during sexual intercourse, as the hole is half the size as normal. It was freaking me out. My boyfriend at the time is my boyfriend now and he was fine when I told him. He said that we would just deal with it when the time came. My wall was too thick to be snipped out and was as long as a finger going right up to just before my cervix. Apparently, the vaginal septum is normal for babies in the womb, but itaposs supposed to dissolve.  Mine just never dissolved. Mine was a bit thicker and longer than normal, which is why I had to get surgery. After sharing her story on social media, Tee has had many women reach out with similar experiences. She added: The craziest thing about posting it is the amount of people who have commented saying they have similar problems. There are so many girls commenting that they have a similar thing, and they didnapost realise that it wasnapost normal. Iaposm glad Iaposm not the only person. I honestly thought for a while there that maybe I was an idiot for not realising you werenapost supposed to have two openings down there. But after posting a video about it, Iaposve realised that no one really knows that we werenapost supposed to have two. It is something Iaposm not worried about anymore. That was me, now itaposs over and Iaposm good now.

Svetlana, , from Russia, claims the cosmetic surgeon used a new drug recently approved for use in Britain and other Western countries, but that it destroyed her looks “irreversibly ageing her ten years”. She turned into a “recluse”, saying: “My skin sagged like a rag, the face completely departed from the skull. “The connection of the skin to the skull, the so-called ligaments of the face, disappeared.” A criminal case has now been launched into her case in Russia, but Svetlana says her love le and career has been ruined and she has spoken out to warn other women.  “Itaposs very scary,” she said. “Asyou were killed, you decompose - and see it every day in the mirror. “Itaposs like your face is melting and you canapost stop it. “Doctors donapost know how to treat it. “If I had even had the slightest hint that this could happen, I would never have gone to a beautician at all.” Her problems started when she was advised by her cosmetologist to remove old lting gel implants with injections of Longidaza, a Russian drug with multiple uses that has been approved this year for use in many Western countries, reported Russian channel NTV.  She had sought treatment because “my then boyfriend kept telling me - supposedly as a joke - ‘You’re old - I’ll find myself a younger model’,” she said. Subconsciously, she believed him and tried to improve her face with cosmetic surgery, she said. He dumped her when her surgery went wrong, she said. Svetlana has been advised that the drug “destroyed the collagen” on her face and her “skin became saggy”. She had gone to a surgeon in March  who she had visited earlier in her home city Perm. The medic - a fully qualied doctor - assured her that the Longidaza would break down excess gel under the skin beneath her eyes, she said.  She had other treatments, too, injecting gel into her cheeks and into her nasolabial fold. She received enzyme and hyaluronic filler in one procedure, she said. “In the evening I went to the mirror and saw that my face had began to change,” she said. “The skin under my eyes dried up and literally fell through. “In the morning, the volume of dried tissue under the eyes increased even more. “Rapid changes were taking place, every hour my face was altering. “Within three days, not only the under-eye, but also the upper eyelid, was completely dry.  “My eyebrows dropped down, the outer corners of the eyes dropped. “I couldnapost understand what was going on.” She has been told subsequently that the Longidaza, an allergenic anti-scar drug, was “eating away at my tissues”. Svetlana said: “I didn’t realise at the time that it was irreversible.” Her beautician Dr Irina Freimanis then injected more gel but also used more of the new drug, this time giving her treatment for free, said the victim. The new fillers caused her pain but did not solve the worsening problem. ‘After all these injections, I saw another person in the mirror every day,” said Svetlana. “It was clear that some kind of chemical process was taking place and the face was changing. This was really scary.  Surgeons and ophthalmologists warned her that due to damage to her eye area , her vision would be damaged. “I stopped communicating with people, I shut myself away,” she said. “Everyone asked what happened to me, why I didn’t look like myself, what was wrong with my eyes. I continued to swell a lot, and stopped leaving the house so as not to scare anyone.” Covid face masks saved her embarrassment but she also wore large dark glasses and a cap, completely covering my face since in profile I had a very unnaturally flat forehead and temples.  “My face shrank like during mummication.” On the web she realised that she was not alone in suffering such problems. She went to the Russian Investigative Committee which is now examining the case, and was medically checked as she sought a way out. “Some doctors told me: ’Yes, this drug has corroded your face, it is irreversible…’.”  Her cosmetologist - who is contesting the case - was caught on video saying: “Go and prove I injected you with Longidaza.” Svetlana says she bitterly regrets undergoing the treatment. The architect said: “I now look at my photos and videos before this and I see that everything was good”. She “found fault” with herself because of her boyfriend’s words, she said. “In most cases, women do not need any procedures. “You just need to drink vitamins, eat well and lead a healthy lestyle. “But society imposes its stereotypes on us, the cult of beauty is actively imposed on us.” She said: “I am telling my story here to warn other girls and women….what might happen to them.  “You canapost blindly trust doctors, even with many qualications.“You need to love yourself and watch Instagram less, and not listen to people who say: ‘You’re getting old’.“Better to grow old with dignity and do nothing with your face. “I am very sorry that I even applied for any procedure. I wish I hadnapost. “I just wanted to correct the minimal age-related changes, but I could not even think that my face would be ditched in such a way that it would cost me my whole le.” Svetlana said: Two years ago I was successful, everything worked out for me, my career was going in an upward trajectory, everything was fine. “And this fatal mistake - my visit to a beautician - broke my whole le. “It looks like appearance is not important. But appearance is very important, especially for a woman. “Your face is your calling card. “I would agree to anything to get my face back. But this is unreal. “Even aftersurgery, it will be a completely dferent face, and the skin will not be completely restored.” Longidaza has used widely in Russia and neighbouring countries for  years. It has applications in pulmonology, urology, and has been used to treat Covid- patients, assisting in overcoming breathing problems. Its makers say it has some uses in cosmetology. The committee is investigating the case, and assessing Svetlanaaposs claims. When confronted with a claim from Svetlana, the doctor said on video: I donapost care what you brought…goodbye, go away.

Aberdeen Performing Arts is stepping down from the role after  years in which she oversaw the renovation of the Music Hall and steered the arts organisation through the pandemic.Announcing she was would be leaving the post in spring next year, Jane said: “If I listened to my heart, I’d never leave Aberdeen Performing Arts but after a letime working in the arts, my head is telling me it’s time to step away.”Jane has been chief executive of Aberdeen Performing Arts – which runs His Majesty’s Theatre, the Music Hall and the Lemon Tree #  since .Under her leadership the organisation delivered the £ million Music Hall redevelopment and introduced three new festivals to the city # Granite Noir Book Festival, True North Music Festival and Light the Blue youth arts festival.She also oversaw the expansion and ersication of work on all stages, deepened engagement with communities, and established Freshly Squeezed Productions to commission and produce work in the north-east.Jane said: “I’ve lived my dream job for the past  years and it will be hard to say goodbye to my wonderful work family especially after what we’ve been through together in the last  months. I’m immensely proud of the values-led, people-centred culture that has driven our success over the last few years and seen us through the pandemic.More recently Jane has had to steer APA through the storms of the Covid pandemic, which saw its three venues go dark for more than  months.She said: “As we emerge from the pandemic and welcome audiences into our venues again, we are optimistic for the future and I’m sure that Aberdeen Performing Arts will emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.“Jobs like this don’t come up very often and it will be an amazing opportunity to take a great team, an engaged board and invested partners beyond  to deliver our shared ambitions for the arts in Aberdeen, the north-east and in Scotland.”Jane’s contribution in the north-east was recognised when she received a Letime Achievement Award at the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce Northern Star Business Awards in . She is an RSA Fellow and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.Tributes to her role in championing arts at APA and the wider north-east poured in on news of her stepping down.APA chairperson, Craig Pike, said: “Aberdeen Performing Arts has benefitted hugely from Jane’s vision, ambition, energy and passion in a role that she has made her own, with an outstanding level of dedication to the job in hand.“She has been an inspirational and compassionate leader, never more in evidence than during the pandemic, tirelessly advocating and fundraising to keep us solvent, safeguard jobs and always with the welfare of her work family in mind.“She leaves an organisation that is firmly anchored at the heart of artistic, community, cultural and civic le in the north-east.  It has been a joy and an honour to work with Jane.”Culture Spokesperson for Aberdeen City Council, Councillor Marie Boulton, said: “Jane arrived with an ambitious agenda for change and has played a major role in shaping the cultural landscape in the city over the last decade.”Prior to joining APA, Jane was Horsecross Arts first Chief Executive and during her  years in the role, she opened the new Perth Concert Hall to critical acclaim, championed the redevelopment of Perth Theatre and led a multi-award-winning team.APA said the search for the new chief executive begins.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

who had just announced Stephen Hatfield as their new manager - forced three corners in the opening stages as they aimed to make an instant impression for their new boss.But Gala weathered the initial storm and with just four minutes on the clock Calum Hall cut in from the left and drilled a -yard pile-driver into the bottom corner of the net.After that, the visitors totally dictated the play, pinning Gretna back deep into their own half with skipper Jack Beaumont spraying passes across the park as Gala probed and pressed for the breakthrough.And it came on the ninth minute mark when Ciaren Chalmers burst through the home defence and his shot squeezed over the line.The dominance continued and a third goal arrived in the rd minute when Zander Murray spectacularly erted a Beaumont delivery into the roof of the net with a volley.After the interval Gretna retreated into their own half to try and keep the score down and the plan worked.Although Gala should have scored a fourth on the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty for handball.Daryl Healys spot kick lacked power and the Gretna keeper pulled off a fine save.Gala continued to dominate but Gretna were dangerous on the break and almost pulled one back when a shot struck the inside of the post but bounced back along the line.And Gala had keeper Dean Beveridge to thank for a brilliant slide tackle to foil a Gretna forward who had evaded the offside trap.However, the visitors were coasting to victory with Gregor Jordan and Lewis Hall outstanding at the back with the game outcome out of sight.Unfortunately, a stramash in the Gala goalmouth in injury time as a corner was about to be delivered ended the game on an ugly note.The result was four yellow cards - two for each team - with one of them to Gala right back Sean Docherty, currently on loan from Hearts, but as he had been booked earlier he ultimately received a red card which was a disappointing end to the game.With five wins in a row, Gala now have a huge Lowland League encounter against Civil Service Strollers at Netherdale on SaturdayThe Edinburgh side are the surprise packets of the Lowland League this season and are currently deservedly fourth in the table with another midweek win against Caledonian Braves.

Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area. Irsquom sure everyone will welcome the new investment and will look pragmatically at the new proposals in light of the current economic backdrop.Premier InnA spokesperson told us: ldquoThe contract we agreed with our development partner has now expired and having re-appraised the proposed -bedroom hotel in the current economic climate, it is currently unviable for [owner] Whitbread.

This week, reporter Hilary Scott speaks to two men who, for several years, have helped people in the Borders...Itrsquos hard to believe that the Peeblesshire Foodbank has been running for almost a decade.When Francis Mordaunt and James Adams decided to join the small team of volunteers, they all thought the foodbank would be short-lived, a stop-gap while the economy recovered from the financial collapse.But the desperate crisis of people going hungry continued to rise, and the impact of the pandemic was felt most deeply by poorer households.Former manager Francis, and team leader James, have now retired from their roles.This week, they told me how the foodbank went from operating from a garage with a few referrals, to becoming a registered charity with premises in Cavalry Park, feeding hundreds of people across the county.The foodbank was formed in  following a meeting held at St.Peters Episcopal Church, initiated by the Rector Rev Jim Benton-Evans.Rev Jim was chairman, Katie Buckingham was secretary, and the manager was Gillian Hughes. The board of governors included several clergy, a headteacher, a local councillor and several others, who decided to operated under the auspices of The Trussell Trust, who were involved in many other foodbanks in the UK.Francis retired to Peebles that year and joined the congregation of St Peterrsquos.ldquoHaving told Rev Jim that I was interested in becoming involved in the community, he invited me to become a volunteer, he said.ldquoMany years earlier, while living in Edinburgh, I had helped at the Old St.Pauls Ritz Cafeacute that provided breakfasts during the week to the homeless men and women in the Grassmarket and central Edinburgh. So volunteering at the foodbank in Peebles appealed to me as it was another opportunity to help those who for whatever reason were going hungry.Initially, Francisrsquos voluntary role was packing food parcels at the Bakehouse Hall and delivering them.ldquoIn those early days, the food was stored in Enid Clariersquos garage in March Street Lane, he said.In Autumn , local MP David Mundell officially opened the Peeblesshire Foodbank, and Francis was appointed treasurer.Francis said: ldquoI inherited a positive bank balance from the initial fundraising efforts before I became a volunteer. Unfortunately, our costs were almost non-existent, so there was little to do the first purchase I remember was a set of scales as the Trussell Trust required us to weigh all food donations in and out and record them on a central database.The foodbank soon moved to more permanent premises in Cavalry Park with storage space for food donations.Francis added: ldquoWe now had a modest rent to pay, insurance costs and a mobile phone but few other costs. The Trussell Trust required us to become a charity, and Rev Jim asked me to complete the application to the Scottish Charity Commission.The Peeblesshire Foodbank became a registered charity in January , and two years later, Rev Jim handed over the reins of the foodbank.Before departing, he set up a management structure to ensure the foodbank continued to run smoothly.Francis, who was appointed as manager, worked with team leader James Adams.Rev Callum MacDougall was the chairman until his retirement in , when Father Tony Lappin took up the position.ldquoOnce the pandemic hit the premises at Cavalry Park became hopelessly small, and Father Tony arranged for the foodbank to move temporarily to St Josephrsquos Hall, explained Francis.ldquoSo one of my last actions for the foodbank before retiring was to arrange the rental of the new much bigger premises in Cavalry Park where the Peeblesshire foodbank is now located.Since its inception, the number of people reaching out to the foodbank for help has grown rapidly.ldquoIn the early years, we had up to two referrals a week, about  a year with an average of two people fed per referral. That meant we were feeding about  people a year, said Francis. ldquoBy , that had increased to nearly  people a year, and by  it was over .Francis said the role made him quite emotional at times: ldquoIn several cases, the recipients burst into tears on receiving their food parcels delivered to their doors. It meant a lot to me to see the gratitude as the foodbank was meeting an urgent need.Jamesrsquos involvement in the foodbank echoed Francisrsquos, as he retired to Peebles from Belfast in  and joined St Peterrsquos Church.He said: ldquoMy we and I were anxious to get involved with the community and make friends, and to help with a foodbank seemed a worthwhile opportunity.Recalling the old days when they used a garage to store food, James said: ldquoIt had no heat or light and littleany shelving, but it was a base. Donations were mainly from Tesco collections.ldquoThere was a book recording parcels issued, and my memory was that perhaps only four or five were issued in an average week, and there was a description of the call and the circumstances. I donrsquot think the availability of the Foodbank was well publicised at that time.However, he says there was a dficult period when he and Francis struggled to keep up with demand.ldquoWe ended up covering  days at a time, which was not sustainable. We were, on average, delivering around eight parcels per week at that time.Appeals for help brought in big-hearted community volunteers.James said: ldquoWe were able to move to a four-week rota, and Billtook responsibility for uplting donations and collecting empty boxes. In addition, positive steps were taken to advertise the foodbank and increase usage, and leaders met at intervals to discuss all aspects of the foodbank. This was, I believe when things began to move forward.Although the charity had an army of volunteers, financial constraints were a concern.ldquoIn the beginning, money was scarce, and there was always a worrywe could continue to afford the premises when we moved to Caly Park, said James.However, both have paid tribute to ldquosuper fundraiser, Nancy Fenton.James added: ldquoNancy held a coffee morning and progressed from that to raising money by selling a wide iety of items online. The work she put in was phenomenal, as was the cash raised, but these efforts raised the profile of the foodbank as well. Her efforts gave us a very secure financial base which has provided some security as the Foodbank progresses.In addition, local churches, businesses, charities and iniduals raised funds for the foodbank, usually on their own initiative.And iniduals have been making financial donations directly to the bank account via the website.Francis added: ldquoDonations of food, particularly through the local supermarket collection points, always continued at a high level, and shortages were only ever confined to a relatively few inidual items. The generosity of the Peeblesshire community has been incredible.Reflecting on his days delivering food parcels to those in need, James said: ldquoThere were people, mainly those living alone, who I delivered to more than a few times. I rightly or wrongly felt that they found it dficult simply to cope with le in general, and the foodbank was essential to simply feed themselves.Ultimately, COVID and age marked the end of Francis and Jamesrsquos incredible journey with the Peeblesshire Foodbank.The Trussell Trust stood down everyone over the age of  years.During the pandemic, one thing thatrsquos brightened our lives has been the stories of the everyday heroes doing their bit to support people through these dficult days.Together, these two selfless gentlemen worked tirelessly for several years making sure struggling families had a meal to put on the table.They are the retiring heroes behind Peeblesshire Foodbank, who helped countless people."},{"url":null,"title":"former-jed-forest-star-completes-ninth-charity-marathon","story":"FORMER Jed-Forest star Chris Laidlaw is now three quarters of the way through his lsquo in  marathon challengersquo.Laidlaw, who hails from Jedburgh has been running a marathon each month this year to raise funds for three charities which mean a lot to him - the Murrayfield Injured Players Foundation Marie Curie and Alzheimerrsquos Scotland.His first marathon took place on New Yearrsquos Day on a -mile course near Edinburgh and since then he has run another eight.This was ato happy territory for him as he set out from Fisherrow Harbour in Musselburgh and finished at Hallhill, home ground for Dunbar Rugby Club, where he spent three years as Development Officer.He said: ldquoThe marathons donrsquot get any easier.

Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraiser-raises-700-walk-scott-foundation","story":"Iain Donaldson-Elder, , a former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil, participated in this yearrsquos recent Walk with Scott.Walkers covered  miles across East Lothian and Iain joined at Haddington as they made their way to the town rugby club after following the Longniddry to Haddington railway walk.Accompanied by Jim Liddle, from Leuchie House, a respite centre near North Berwick for people with MS and other long-term conditions, Iain ldquorolled his wheelchair for about three miles and was delighted to receive a certicate as a Scotter of the Year from Councillor Colin McGinn.Iain told the Courier: ldquoThe walk itself was wonderful, emotional and, although short, very rewarding as I got to meet people that I had only known through Facebook.

I have friends currently supporting student children on courses asking themselvesthe current arrangements are adequate and provide the high-value education they are paying for. Our students have been having a hard time of it over the past  months and now on top of Covid there is a shortage of accommodation. This is particularly acute around Glasgow due to the upcoming COP conference, and some have nowhere to stay.Irsquom sure that there are many parents who will be thinking that this might not be a good time for their child to embark on a university course, but the reality is we need a steady supply of young people with a broad base of skills to keep our economy going and our employers provided with adequate numbers of skilled people. Universities have a role in ensuring that they can provide these people. Believe me, you donrsquot want to phone the dentist when you have toothache to be told they donrsquot have a dentist, as ldquothere is a shortage as none graduated this year.It would appear to me that the world will have to live with Covid- for some time to come indeed this may be as good as it gets, so it would be good to hearthere are plans for the universities toto some semblance of normality. If not now, then when Ian Higgins, Airdrie.A SAD WASTE OF NHS RESOURCESHAVING attended my consultant at an eye clinic in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, my prescription for eye drops was changed. I duly explained this to my GP surgery receptionist, when requesting a new prescription. I collected the packet, and discovered when home that I had been given the former, and not the new drops.I phoned the surgery and was told that as they hadnt received notication of the change, I would need to contact the hospital and chase up the required letter, which I did. I then contacted the chemist, and advised them of the change and offered tothe mistaken prescription, which they said I could do, but the drops would have to be destroyed. As it happens, they are single-phial drops, in sealed \"envelopes\", in unopened boxes, and I only collected them two days ago. No matter, for the tiresome \"health and safety\" mantra, they have to be destroyed, and no, they cannot be donated to a third world country.I believe a similar situation pertains with, for example, urine and blood sample bottles. When a box is opened, and is discovered to contain the wrong type of bottle, the whole consignment is destroyed. I am sure there are many other examples of such profligacy. Its akin to burning pound notes.

Yes, rain-soaked Scotland really is short of water.The issue of course is not about a lack of water per se, but a lack of water that is safe to drink. That article had people from both SEPA and Scottish Water saying that maintaining some public water supplies was a ldquosignicant challenge after the second driest summer in  years.It is certainly counter-intuitive, as I look out of the window while writing this and see rivulets of water gushing down the gutters once again, to be hearing calls to conserve water. But the experts are right. Climate change is having many adverse impacts on our reality in Scotland today, and this is one of them. At Citizens Advice Scotland, we advocate for the consumer interest in a number of public services, one of them being water. And there is one group of people who can be particularly vulnerable to these trends, and that is those who rely on private water supplies. These can be single households or whole communities, and their supply systems can y from a simple pipe directing water from a nearby stream to their homes using basic filters, to more robust treatment structures. But the point is they are not part of the public water system and so lack the protections enjoyed by the rest of us.In July, a private water community in South Ayrshire ran out of water. Without any warning, peoplesrsquo water just stopped coming out of their taps. The local MSP, Elena Whitham, called the issue a lsquohumanitarian crisisrsquo. You might think that language is a bit over the top  If you do, try living without your water source for  hours.Of course, Irsquom not actually suggesting you do that. Depriving yourself and your family of clean water to drink, wash and cook with is dangerous. But hopefully the thought is enough to make the point.In that Ayrshire case the government stepped in to provide bottled water until the supply was restored but for those affected in the meantime, this was a very serious issue. And lack of supply is not the only problem. Therersquos also the issue of water quality. Many private water supplies are not required to test their water for safety. As a result, the quality of the water may be sub-standard, containing things such as E.Coli. Treatment processes, y and wersquove even heard anecdotal evidence of people straining their water with hospital stockings. Hopefully yoursquoll agree that therersquos a problem here that requires some attention.Letrsquos start by busting a couple of common myths about private water supplies. Myth number : the numbers of people who use a private supply are tiny. Well, in fact more than , people in Scotland rely on one. Imaginethey all lived in the same place. Thatrsquos a city not much smaller than Aberdeen. If Aberdeenrsquos water supply was sporadic and unsafe, I think wersquod all agree we need to fix that.Myth number two: private water supplies only exist for remote dwellers, eccentric tree-hugging types whorsquove chosen to live that way so knew the risks. In fact, the vast majority of those who rely on a private supply did not choose to do so. Itrsquos just the place they were born or had to move to for employment.The fact that private supplies are disproportionately concentrated in rural areas means there is a risk of growing inequality in terms of access to safe drinking water across Scotland. The ability of the rural community and economy to thrive is fundamentally based on its ability to access safe drinking water, and this is being threatened by climate change impacts such as lower rainfall during the summer months ndash as we saw this year, and in three of the last four years.Think about this too. Problems with private supplies donrsquot just affect the people who live there. If yoursquove spent a holiday or a day-trip to Argyll or the Highlands therersquos a good chance yoursquove stayed in a hotel or eaten in a restaurant that is served by a private supply. Looked at that way, the figure of , people affected is a low estimate.So, in partnership with the Drinking Water Quality Regulator, CAS recently commissioned research to support the development of more resilient and empowered private supply communities.The evidence suggests that lack of information and training, the complexity of water treatment and maintenance, and issues of affordability all combine to mean water quantity and quality are never guaranteed for private water supply users. This could present a very real threat to public health for a large group of people.Scotland has made an international commitment to ensure access to safe drinking water for all its citizens, in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as a national commitment to keep pace with EU law, which recognises water as a human right and requires action to improve access. CAS is working collaboratively with key stakeholders to identy ways of meeting these.With COP just weeks away, Scotland needs to showcase our commitment to sustainability. A lot of attention is focusing, quite rightly, on energy efficiency. But we mustnrsquot overlook the issues around water as well. Private water consumers must have the support they need to secure their capacity and build resilience to climate change impacts.Emma Ash is a senior policy officer at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"gregor-townsend-names-36-man-scotland-squad-autumn-nations-series","story":"The national team boss has selected the squad for the matches against Tonga, Australia, South Africa and Japan starting at the end of this month.Townsends squad features  players from the summer squad with  uncapped players also making the training squad.The players will join up on Sunday  October and begin training the following day at the Oriam high Performance centre near Edinburgh.On the squad announcement, head coach Townsend said:ldquoIt has been great to see both Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors make positive starts to their URC campaigns driven by some standout performances from both young and established players.ldquoWith four tough Test matches ahead of us in this yearrsquos Autumn Nations Series it is important we bring players together early, connect with them as coaches and enable them to grow as a group before the campaign gets underway against Tonga at BT Murrayfield.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1634055639229.jpg--covid_19___tue_12th_sept_figures.jpg?1634055639000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211012newscovid 19 tue 12th oct figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The EU move has been seen as a bid to ‘de-dramatise’ the situation.It’s understood the EU proposals will not address Lord Frost’s surprise ECJ demands, which only emerged this week.Yesterday, the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned that temporary fixes or tinkering around the edges will not resolve problems with the Protocol.However, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused the UK Government of “acting duplicitously” in negotiations with the EU and “attempting to tear up yet another international agreement”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The attempts by the Tories and the DUP to undermine the protections and opportunities of the protocol and impose a hard border must be opposed,” she added.In a speech in Lisbon yesterday, Lord Frost said without scrapping the ECJ arbitration role, the protocol could never command the support of both unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland.Responding to the speech, Sir Jeffrey said: “The people who live and work here need a solution which can command support throughout the community. That is why, when I became leader just over  days ago, I made this my number one priority.“This is not a time for tinkering around the edges with temporary fixes. We need a long-term solution which will then allow us all to plan and get back to focusing on fixing our public services rather debating the protocol.”Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said: “That Lord Frost is asking the EU to help maintain the delicate balance between the communities in Northern Ireland should give those in Brussels and Dublin pause to consider the way in which they wish to conduct the critical negotiations that will follow.”SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole criticised Lord Frost’s remarks.“The EU is poised to make proposals which we hope will contribute to repairing relationships across these islands and managing the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and Britain under the protocol. It is frankly a bad faith intervention for the UK Government to distort the facts of the protocol and peddle misinformation on the eve of a new round of negotiations,” he said.Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry MP claimed the UK Government was more interested in continued confrontation than seeking solutions.“Rather than await the proposals from the European Commission on Wednesday, he has chosen to enter into another layer of delusion,” he saidTUV leader Jim Allister said: “If, as Lord Frost says, it is the UK that governs NI, then there must be an end to the EU’s writ in this part of the UK — that requires us not being subject, not just to the ECJ, but EU laws and an end to GB being a ‘third country’ in terms of trade. Put simply, it requires an end to the protocol in all its parts.”Meanwhile, MLAs clashed yesterday over a High Court ruling that the DUP boycott of north-south meetings in protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol is unlawful. Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson raised the matter in an urgent question to First Minister Paul Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill in the Assembly on Tuesday.Mr Dickson asked whether meetings of the North South Ministerial Council would resume immediately after the ruling. Responding, Mr Givan said the judgment was “currently being considered”.Mr Dickson further asked, “having had his party placed in the dock yesterday”, what action he now proposes to ensure that he and all the executive ministers would “adhere to the ruling of the court”. Mr Givan said the “way to resolve this is through a political resolution”. “I look forward to what the European Union will publish tomorrow.”Later Mr Givan indicated that health business was exempt from the boycott.He added: “I have also added to that, given that the peace-plus programme has within it a particular theme that relates to health and funding associated with that, subject to the Deputy First Minister approving, that that meeting should take place and it should then approve the peace-plus funding in respect of the urgent procedure that the Finance Ministerhas requested.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingBelfast restaurant Top Blade slammed for posting image of woman’s underwear on social mediaNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offMurder investigation launched after woman dies in Co Derry car blazeFormer UTV studios on Belfast’s Ormeau Road saved from demolitionTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloghrim car firePlaySir Kenneth Branagh reveals how lockdown inspired film about childhoodPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest BrexitVaradkar warns Frost that EU will not be cowed by latest Brexit demandsBrexit ‘complications’ behind NI rejection as filming location for new German TV dramaSinn Fein wrong over church service snub: TaoiseachWe want the NI Protocol to work as smoothly as possible, says Taoiseach as he insists his government recognises unionist concernsBoris Johnson ‘deeply embarrassed’ by protocol claims Sammy Wilson, as NI mentioned just once during PM’s speechLatestAnger as voluntary severance scheme launched on the railwaysOrient’s Lawrence Vigouroux: Edouard Mendy paving way for black goalkeepersKeith Urban on balancing his touring commitments with home leDanish artist seeksof Tiananmen Square memorial sculptureEndurance swimmer attempts to make history with th English Channel crossing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragedies like Sarah Everard, and in the news when it feels like there#s something every day that relates to violence against women and marginalised groups, it#s time for us to push the campaign and start talking about these issues, she said.Street harassment against women and marginalised groups is a big issue and it#s not one that#s going to solved easily, said Ms Campbell.We want to explore what we can do to help the issue and also to raise awareness among people who might be harassing others. We believe this will change in the future.”She said: We want to see signage on bus stops, for example — social media is such a narrow demographic and we want to reach more people.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The pair met while studying in Maastricht University in the Netherlands on the Erasmus scheme, where their eyes were opened on how street harassment has been criminalised in countries like Belgium and Portugal, where legislation has been passed to criminalise street harassment.Having both experienced street harassment in their personal lives, Ms Campbell said they were surprised to find out what actually constituted harassment in the Netherlands, where fines of over £ have been introduced in some cities for catcalling and horn-honking. Over there it#s the same as littering,you#re caught you#ll get an on the spot fine, said Ms Campbell.Harassment is not something we should expect and we thought it was time to start educating people here. We started an Instagram to speak to people and educate them on why we shouldn#t accept it and how men can be allies, she said.The pair and the wider team around Stop Street Harassment NI, which now includes a total of six people, are now gathering research and information to further the issue.After meeting with Mrs Long twice in the past year, they now hope the Assembly will work with them to gather sample data and research to explore the issue of legislation.On Monday, they met with Ms Nicholl to discuss street safety in Belfast.Ms Campbell said some extreme forms of street harassment such as stalking and leering are included in the Protection from Stalking bill, which was introduced by Mrs Long earlier this year.But she and Ms Wallace believestreet harassment was identied as a wrong within the law, it would act as a deterrent.“This will also allow incidents of street harassment to be reported more easily, which at present can only be donean inidual is harassed by the same perpetrator three times, and due to nature of street harassment this is extremely rare,” she said. The women hope in future months and through their work with local councils that their signage and materials will become more recognisable to people around Northern Ireland and reach an audience that is not engaged with their material on social media, including a campaign where they heard stories of how street harassment affects both men and women on our streets. They believestreet harassment was tackled at the point at which it occurs, it would deter the escalation of other behaviour that can target women and some minority groups, creating a safer space for all in Northern Ireland. Ms Campbell said: A lot of people don#t feel comfortable on the streets at night now that it#s starting to get darker, especially with recent stories in the news.If you look at the pyramid of violence, street harassment is of course at the bottom but at the top would be murder —it#s not being tackled at the bottom, it#s very possible for things to escalate. It#s catching things early that#s important.It#s obviously not all men but too many men do this.

I had the opportunity to put strongly worded questions to Brandon Lewis about the British government’s legacy proposals and to put forward my views.“He was very engaging and responded directly. I told him the proposed amnesty will massively harm Britain’s standing in the US and urged him not to go ahead with it.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I was surprised to get the invitation to meet him. The AOH was grateful of the opportunity to outline our views.”The Northern Ireland Office has been contacted for comment.The New York lawyer was banned from the UK in  but defied the authorities, appearing at an anti-internment rally in west Belfast. In an attempt to arrest him, the RUC stormed the crowd and shot dead Sean Downes with a plastic bullet. The ban was lted six years later.Once a close confidant of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, Mr Galvin parted ways with Sinn Fein during the late s, becoming a staunch critic of the peace process and accusing the party of “abandoning republicanism”.He spoke at events supporting dissident republican prisoners and was a personal friend of Real IRA leader Mickey McKevitt and his we Bernadette Sands McKevitt.In his role as Freedom for All-Ireland chair in the AOH, Mr Galvin works with nationalist Troubles victims, campaign groups and others including Sinn Fein.AOH national vice-president Sean Pender accompanied the ex-Noraid leader to the meeting. “It lasted around  minutes. It was at British offices off Second Avenue. I led republican demonstrations to very near that location during the hunger-strike,” said Mr Galvin.“I told Brandon Lewis the amnesty proposal would represent the British government’s final cover-up in Ireland.“The AOH has been supporting the Ballymurphy massacre and Bloody Sunday families and many others for decades. An amnesty would not draw a line under the past but add a new chapter of hurt and injustice.“It wouldn’t herald an end to the battle for legacy truth but begin fresh court challenges that will cut across new generations. The Stormont House Agreement should be implemented.“I hope Brandon Lewis rethinks the proposals. He can be in no doubt of the opposition in Irish America, including in Congress, to them. Combined with that in Ireland, it has the potential to cause uproar and seriously harm his government’s credibility across the world.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsIRABrandon LewisMore On IRA PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionNationalists can’t trust Boris Johnson... but neither can unionists PremiumGarfield Beattie: From UVF Glenanne murder gang member to painter of republican iconsNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingFormer NIO boss Sir John Chilcot involved in IRA peace talks dies PremiumReport uncovers failures by police during probe into officer’s murderMost ReadNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingBelfast restaurant Top Blade slammed for posting image of woman’s underwear on social mediaNI doctor who went to work in hospital while drunk avoids being struck offMurder investigation launched after woman dies in Co Derry car blazeFormer UTV studios on Belfast’s Ormeau Road saved from demolitionTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloghrim car firePlaySir Kenneth Branagh reveals how lockdown inspired film about childhoodPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest Northern IrelandNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusEU set to cut red tape caused by protocol but rebuff UK demand on role of judgesDeclan BogueOpinionSporting relationships have changed since the good old days… and it’s a much healthier environmentGas storage project off coast of NI given green light, creating  jobs during constructionLeo Varadkar warns global political leaders over agreements with UK GovernmentLatestNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusLiam BeckettOpinionPat Jennings is still the mark of humility and class… unlike a lot of today’s  so-called starsRussell StoddartOpinionCristiano Ronaldo is an ageing Messiah and Ole Gunnar Sokskjaer must be allowed to get the best out of him at Manchester United… not questioned at every turnApple warns allowing app sideloading would ‘cripple’ security measuresTravel rules mean UK is one of world’s ‘worst-performing countries’ for tourism,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Dawn McLaughlin was speaking at the Londonderry Chamber’s President’s Annual Dinner in the Everglades Hotel in the city. Attended by over  business leaders, politicians, and civic leaders, the dinner was the first major Chamber event since March . googletag.cmd.push Sponsored by Find Insurance NI, the dinner was hosted by former broadcast journalist Sarah Travers and featured a ‘fireside chat’ with RTEacute Europe Editor and Brexit expert Tony Connelly, who is originally from the city. Dawn McLaughlin said now is the time for elected representatives, candidates, and ministers to prioritise Derry and the North West as we move closer to next year’s election and has called on parties to work constructively to rebuild the local economy after the impact of the pandemic. Chamber President Dawn McLaughlin said: “The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the North West economy, but I have been heartened and filled with pride by the way in which our local business owners and leaders reacted to the crisis before them. “The dinner is a fantastic occasion and opportunity to celebrate our resilience, recognise the strides we have made collectively over the past  months, and commend the efforts made by our local business community in protecting jobs and keeping their companies afloat in the most dficult of circumstances. “As we begin to come out the other side of the pandemic, the time is now for our ministers and our elected representatives at Stormont to prioritise the North West and deliver for our region.     “While the signing off of the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the opening of the School of Medicine at Magee earlier this year were welcome first steps, there is much more that needs to be done to address regional inequality in Northern Ireland and level up the North West City Region. “Ahead of the next Assembly election in spring next year, candidates from all political parties must commit to properly invest in our city, create and attract new jobs to our region, and address deficiencies in our economy. Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

St Canices Wellbeing Group was recently formed with a view to offer confidential support and advice on a wide range of issues including mental health, addiction, sexuality, diet, health and bereavement. googletag.cmd.push On Sunday , the group host its first ever event – a k walk in support of World Mental Health Day. Dozens of people turned out to take part in what the committee hope will be the first of many events. St Canices GAC Chairman Kieran McKeever is just one of the committee members of the wellbeing group. He said a demand for support and services on emotional wellbeing, mental health and other issues was identied in the local area and committee members from sports clubs decided to come together to form the new group. “Its well known that mental health, obesity and addiction issues are really common nowadays and we thought that maybe we should take the lead and show people out there in the community that there is a bit of help there for anyone who may need it,” he said. “It started off as a small group but then we got members from the soccer club, the ladies football team, the camogie team and the football team involved so we could expand out and everyone could have access to the service.” The Wellbeing Group has also teamed up with ALPS , a community-based mental health initiative which has a satellite office in Dungiven, to provide additional support and services to the community.     St Canices Wellbeing committee member Julie-Anne Moore said: “The main aim of the group is to highlight the help and support that is available out there. At the minute,people go through the health service, the waiting lists are massive. We are able to signpost people to the support that is available out there. “As a result of covid, we have seen that many issues are coming to the fore and really we are just trying to be pro-active and raise more awareness and show people we are here and there is always someone to listen. “We would like to stress that everything is confidential and it wont be people in the committee that you will be talking to, itll be trained professionals. “We will also be covering all age groups and hope to organise a number of events and workshops in the future in conjunction with the local schools. It is never too early to start talking to children and discuss any issues they may have with them.” Sinn Feacutein Councillor Sean McGlinchey is also a committee member of St Canices Wellbeing Group. Welcoming the addition of the group to the community, he said no matter the issue, big or small, he would encourage anyone who is in need of support or help to reach out. “I would very much welcome this group which I would stress is for all sections of the community. It will be all confidential and I am confident it will provide a much needed service in the community,” he said. “Many people are facing uncertain times ahead with furlough ending and the possibility of people facing unemployment and this will have an impact on peoples mental health so this is a service that we need.” Just one of the services St Canices Wellbeing Group are offering is free CPR and Defibrillator training. The course, which will teach lesaving skills, will be held in St Canices GAC main hall every Thursday from October . “There are defibrillators all around the town and many of us wouldnt know what to do in an emergency or provide basic CPR so we have decided to hold this training,” Kieran McKeever explained. “The CPR and defibrillator training is open to everyone, you dont have to associated with any of the sports clubs however we would advise booking as we can only accommodate ten people per week however we intend to run the course until demand is met.” Participants will receive a certicate on completion of the course. To express an interest or to book your slot, please private mail the clubs Facebook page or text    .

Imagine a student in France being told they could not study French or through French. It just would not be tolerated.ldquoThis situation is compounded by the fact that, outside of the post-primary sector, not one single centre of learning in Derry City is providing A Level Irish for adult learners or ers.ldquoHow has this situation been allowed to develop and where will our future naacuteiscoil, bunscoil and meaacutenscoil teachers, not to mention our university lecturers, come fromurgent remedial action is not taken to reverse this sad decline  I do not understand how anyone, with direct or indirect responsibility for Irish education, has allowed this to happen.Speaking to the Derry News, Reacuteamonn Oacute Ciaraacutein, the Director of Education with Gael Linn, placed the blame squarely on the legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals.In September, Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein chaired an online discussion on the ldquocritical decline in the uptake of Irish in English-medium post primary schools. The discussion was attended by  teachers who ldquofelt compelled to seek urgent and decisive action.They called upon the legislative bodies of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Department of Education and their armrsquosbodies, such as CCEA, as well as the Education Authority, to intercede as matter of urgency to reverse the worrying trends in the study of the Irish language and other languages in English-medium post-primary schools.Gael Linn is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation focused on the promotion of the Irish language and the arts.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein said: ldquoThe legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals will have to realise that the Irish language is more than a school subject. In some schools in the area this is already the case.ldquoFor many, Irish is their native language and, therefore, they should have every opportunity to learn it to the highest level in education. It needs to be facilitated, not made dficult. If the system makes it dficult or less desirable to study a given subject, what will happen inside a number of years is that there will be a decreased demand, where there was once was a greater organic demand.ldquoConversely,we start with the view, whatever happens, we must offer Irish in our school, things will be better for the Irish and its learning.ldquoThe problem of Year  students, in other areas, who chose Irish A Level being unable to study it as a result of time-tabling issues, between schools and their area learning community, has been brought to the attention of Gael Linn. It often starts further down the school when pupils choose Irish and by doing so miss out on another language or subject, or choose another subject and miss out on Irish.RELATEDAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonldquoThere is a perception Irish is marked more severely than other subjects and both teachers and pupils know it may be more dficult to achieve and A*. If students do not study Irish in the first place, for instance, they will not take it later on or at college.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein added that the system made it dficult for pupils to opt for Irish and other languages and then claims there is little or no demand for the subject.ldquoI do not think this is equitable, he said. ldquoEvery effort should be made so that all pupils can study Irish, or other languages, to A Level and in the case of pupils from Gaelscoileanna, it is obvious that the continuity in language learning should be in place.ldquoIf there was legislation in place to promote Irish language rights, as promised in the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, these are precisely the issues a Commissioner for the Irish language would address. A Commissioner could ensure equitable access to Irish language as far as University, which is more than just a school subject.ldquoUlster University, Magee, has an excellent reputation for the study of Irish and one would have thought, therefore, that all the schools in the area, where Irish would have been traditionally offered, would do their best to offer Irish to A Level as a key into university, the local university in particular.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein was confident the situation could be reversed.He recalled: ldquoIn , Irish teachers and supporters came together to campaign for the overturning of a proposal, which at the time was being brought forward by the then Minister of Education, Brian Mawhinney. The proposal would have marginalised and downgraded the Irish language. This campaign was successful.ldquoWhat is happening now across the North is Mawhinney by the backdoor, in my opinion. Irish and other languages are being marginalised and their importance downgraded. This makes me sad but ready to campaign for our special native language to have its rightful place in our education system, along with other languages.ldquoIf students dont get to study Irish, few will end up going to spend time on residential courses in the Gaeltacht, such as those organised by Gael Linn. These courses represent an important rite of passage for thousands of students each summer. However, they rely on students studying Irish at GCSE and A Level to remain viable.ldquoThe Foyle Learning Community has, apparently, failed children who wanted to study A Level Irish because authorities in the area have not been allowing for the rightful signicance of the Irish language in the lives of many pupils in that area and in other areas also. They must have overlooked the signicant cohort of Gaelscoil pupils who would naturally wish to take Irish at GCSE and A Level.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein reiterated that Irish was more than a school subject. He said it should be made available.ldquoNothing short of maximum availability will suffice when it comes to the Irish language, our native language, he said. ldquoWe are all aware of the importance of lelong learning and there should be pathways to GCSE, A Level, diploma, degree and postgraduate study for adults and young people who wish to continue learning Irish while working or after leaving post-primary education. There should be incentives for institutions to offer Irish in this way.ldquoIrish, as a taught subject, is in danger of being available to fewer and fewer students as time progresses. This stems from the disapplication of the requirement to take a language at GCSE taken by the Government in Westminster in , coupled with the excessive emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathssubjects.ldquoIt began to impact in , at the same time as the economic crisis, followed by Brexit confusion and, more recently, Covid-. The crisis in Irish language learning cannot be allowed to deteriorate further. It is too important to us all, even though we dont all realise this as much as we should.ldquoIf this situation continues, fewer students will continue to study Irish at university and this despite the increased demand for Irish in the workplace across the island.

The Mayor of Derry City  Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, visited Mr McIntyre at his home to confirm the announcement where he welcomed the new initiative. Mayor Warke said: “Gay McIntyre is a jazz music phenomenon and has enjoyed a world renowned career performing as a saxophonist and clarinettist for more than seventy-five years, he said. “His career is all the more extraordinary given that he grew up in the city at a time when jazz music was an exception. “He was at the centre of the growth of the local jazz scene which has reached new levels over the last two decades through the festival which he was instrumental in establishing, so it is right and fitting that we honour and celebrate his contribution to the genre.     “He is a name that is known all over the world but his home town is where his heart is so the recognition means a lot to him and I hope it will inspire the next generation of musicians from the city to follow in his footsteps for years to come.” At the meeting Elected members approved a rates allocation of pound, for the  event which will be headlined by Imelda May in the Millennium Forum and Council Officers have been approved to move forward with planning.

Derry City  Strabane District Councils Business and Culture Committee approved the plans at this weeks monthly meeting where they received an update on the success of this years festival and the plans for . googletag.cmd.push After meeting with Gay and his family, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival have announced plansto name the outdoor stage in Guildhall Square the Gay McIntyre Stage and the opening event of the  festival on Thursday, April thwill be known as the Gay McIntyre and Local Legends of Jazz.

The Mayor of Derry City  Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, visited Mr McIntyre at his home to confirm the announcement where he welcomed the new initiative. Mayor Warke said: “Gay McIntyre is a jazz music phenomenon and has enjoyed a world renowned career performing as a saxophonist and clarinettist for more than seventy-five years, he said. “His career is all the more extraordinary given that he grew up in the city at a time when jazz music was an exception. “He was at the centre of the growth of the local jazz scene which has reached new levels over the last two decades through the festival which he was instrumental in establishing, so it is right and fitting that we honour and celebrate his contribution to the genre.     “He is a name that is known all over the world but his home town is where his heart is so the recognition means a lot to him and I hope it will inspire the next generation of musicians from the city to follow in his footsteps for years to come.” At the meeting Elected members approved a rates allocation of pound, for the  event which will be headlined by Imelda May in the Millennium Forum and Council Officers have been approved to move forward with planning. Proposed initiatives include a Schools Education Programme andtheof the Jazz Hubs in The Playhouse   Bennigans Bar and the Great Hall at Magee University. Outdoor music stages will be situated in Guildhall Square and the Craft Village and local legends will open the event with an evening in the Guildhall.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security. A home also affords personal dignity, a space for privacy and a foundation for family le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Best wishes to Knockevin staff  ","story":"SLIEVE Croob councillors Cathy Mason and Roiacutesiacuten Howell paid a recent visit to the new Knockevin senior school in Castlewellan.Located on the site of the former Castlewellan Primary School in the town, the councillors welcomed staff and students and hope that they will be very happy and will be warmly welcomed by the wider community.Cllr Howell said the global pandemic had ldquosignicantly disrupted the education of the special school pupils and impacted on their learning, communication and mental health.She extended best wishes to school principal Sarah Liddell and senior department leader Gillian Rea.ldquoWhilst the children have been on the premises from September, there are still issues that I and Cllr Mason will be working closely with the school, the Education Authority and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ensure that staff and pupils have the best all round experience on their newly refurbished site, added Cllr Howell.Cllr Mason said Knockevin caters for pupils with severe and profound learning dficulties aged between  and  and aims to provide a supportive educational environment where they feel secure, at their ease and thrive both educationally, socially and spiritually.She said the main school is located in Downpatrick, with an Early Years Centre in Dundrum.ldquoNow we have the senior school in Castlewellan which will seek to help pupils achieve their maximum level of independence in preparation for le when their education finishes, said Cllr Mason.She added: ldquoHaving visited the Downpatrick site in recent months I have seen first hand how happy and content the children are in school..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_bid.jpg","title":"Bid to save St Mary’s school from closure  ","story":"GOVERNORS and staff have pledged to try and save a primary school in Saintfield from closure.St Maryrsquos Primary School is earmarked to close by August  next year due to low pupil numbers.The Education Authority last week published the closure proposal seeking any objections or support to be lodged by November .The proposal was made by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the schoolrsquos trustees.It states enrolment to the  year-old school on the Old Grand Jury Road has dwindled to  pupils for this academic year, with the majority in the Primary  and  classes.The proposal claims there is currently only one pupil in the schoolrsquos Primary ,  and  classes, two pupils in Primary  and no pupils in Primary .A spokesperson for CCMS said: ldquoCCMS has carried out initial consultation on the closure of St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield, which is a Down and Connor diocesan school. Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges. CCMS believes that the proposal to discontinue provision at St Maryrsquos PS would not impact signicantly on other schools.It lists other Catholic primary schools in the area mdash St Caolanrsquos in Darragh Cross, St Josephrsquos in Crossgar, and St Patrickrsquos in Ballynahinch mdash as being between less than four to seven miles away from St Maryrsquos and which could take its pupils.The proposal also said closure plans had been put back for a year due to the Covid- pandemic.The SDLP councillor for the area, Cllr Terry Andrews, said he shared the concerns of parents and staff.ldquoSt Maryrsquos has provided first-class education to the community for many, many years and the staff are to be commended for their dedication to generations of families who have sent their children there, he said.ldquoI would encourage all local people to take part in the consultation to the EA and make them aware of their strong feelings to the proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Business owners urged to engage over town future  ","story":"THE Downpatrick business community has been urged to play a full part in the consultation exercise on the continued economic regeneration of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is spearheading the initiative and local councillor Dermot Curran appealing to businesses to get involved.While a number of politicians are in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, local authority officials are not keen. However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others. I hope that this vision can be realised..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_conor.jpg","title":"Conor shines in final  ","story":"DROMARA travelled to Ballykinlar to take on a fancied Drumaness side in the county U- Football Shield final last Sunday evening.The game started well for Drumaness with two quick points on the board from Niall Flanagan and Ben Cassidy in the first few minutes, but soon Dromara were awarded a penalty after Thomas McKey was fouled in the box.Thomas took the penalty himself, but it was well saved by lsquokeeper Reece Rogan.Dromara did get on the scoresheet after a foul on Odhraacuten McCann was converted by Jon Rodgers.Both defences dictated play over the next period with Dromararsquos Elliot Harris, Sam Warwick and James Furphy keeping the mobile Drumaness forwards at bay.Dromararsquos fortunes took a hit when forward Odhraacuten McCann suffered a nasty shoulder injury and had to be replaced.Just before the water-break, Drumaness rattled off two excellent long range scores from Conor Armstrong with Dromara replying with an equally great score from Joe McAllister.Dromara were finding the physicality of the Drumaness full back line of Leo Madine, Ben Miskelly and Philip Gladysz dficult to penetrate.Drumaness finished the quarter with a point from Conor Murphy leaving them ahead by three points.The second quarter started off with another cracking point from Conor Armstrong and within minutes Drumaness took control of the game.Shea Quinn got on the end of a long ball and bagged a goal and a minute later Conor Armstrong hit a second goal.Dromara rallied with good points from Thomas McKey and Jon Rodgers but once again Drumaness replied with a point from a free from Conor Murphy and two further points from the unstoppable Conor Armstrong.Drumaness half backs Jaiden Murdock and Conn OrsquoHagan were delivering quality balls to their forwards and Dromararsquos half backs Aidan OrsquoHare and Ryan Gates had to work very hard to stem the relentless attacks.Young Lorcan McNeill scored a great inidual goal to offer Dromara some hope, but, as ever, the Blues hit straight back with scores from Jake Madine and another from Conor Armstrong.The half ended with a fine point for Dromara from the energetic Joe McAllister to leave Drumaness leading by nine points. Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks. Congratulations to the Drumaness team and their mentors on a great display and a deserved victory.Dromara -Drumaness -U- Shield Final.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_cormac.jpg","title":"Cormac enjoy his first days at Harvard University  ","story":"CORMAC Savage was only  when he got his first experience of the hallowed halls of Hard University.Standing in the same place where former president John F Kennedy once walked was enough to confirm to the young teenager that this is where he had to be one day.Just four years later, the Downpatrick man has fulfilled his dream and is studying at the world-renowned Ivy League university in the US.The former head boy of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School has jumped right in and immersed himself into his classes and every extra-curricular activity and group he can possibly join.He has been in the city of Cambridge, on the fringe of Boston, since late August.Despite getting four A* grades in his A-Levels and having achieved considerable praise for his roles in school politics and as a Youth Parliament Member for South Down, he said he was overwhelmed to have been accepted into Hard late last year.ldquoEvery single day I think Irsquom so lucky to be here. I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago. I wrote a letter at  and saidI would like to meet himhe was ever in Ireland.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions. The testing centre in particular is a key asset in the ongoing fight against coronavirus.ldquoThe excellent frontline staff who work there deserve to be allowed to get on with the job free from threats of any kind.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm. After leading out the EDAC team at the Road Relay Champs in style, he ed to Victoria Park in Belfast for the weekly parkrun.These events are not races but timed runs open to anyone who registers. Neil was taking part as a training exercise in his group coached by Mark Kirk.He lead the pack in with a super slick . for the k which was reported later as being the third quickest parkrun time recorded at any of the weekend parkruns throughout the UK.We donrsquot normally report on parkrun as it is impossible to keep on top of all the activity, but this one is worth a mention. Well done for putting EDAC on the map.We are always open to new senior members and have acquired quite a few recently who are glad that they have taken the plunge.We are an all rounder club with members chasing speed, distance and the challenges but we also have a main body who come to training to keep fit and enjoy the good company.If you are interested, please email Donal at membership@eastdownac for details..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie.jpg","title":"Francie builds boat with recycled material  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man is realising his dream of building a river boat by using recycled materials such as wood pallets and aluminium.Instead of costing around pound, for a new boat of the same size and specication, Francie Morgan aims to finish his ft boat on a budget of pound,.The  year-old intends to launch the four-berth boat from Carrybridge in Upper Lough Erne in Co Fermanagh next May, with the help and support of his family and many friends.But before that, he would love to enter it as a float in next yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.While the main structure is complete, Francie will be working over the winter and spring to fit out the inside.The father-of-seven began to build the boat last year during lockdown and scoured scrape-yards and recycled materials yards to get items which either cost him a fraction of their original price or where the owners were only too happy to get rid of them.ldquoTherersquos men who are only too happy to see me coming to take away some pallets. It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will signicantly raise the profile of Killyleagh as a tourist destination and add support to existing town facilities such as shops, entertainment, recreational facilities, schools and churches.SAINTFIELD mdash Dozens of brides arrived at Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church Hall on Thursday evening for a girlsrsquo night out.There was a distinct absence of grooms as women and girls filled the hall

and her husband, Terry Graham, adopted a baby girl from China three years ago.Rosemary, who is the co-founder and now chairman of Holywood-based Future Image PR consultancy firm, and her husband were one of the first families from Northern Ireland to adopt a child from China.As Rosemary explained, she has had a long love affair with China and its people, ever since she heard a woman recite the Lordrsquos Prayer in Chinese when she was at Sunday School.Her fondness of the country continued into her adult years, she travelled quite a bit throughout China and Asia, and when she and Terry

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

This was delayed because of Covid and I canrsquot wait to get started on turning this into an interactive wall mural.The Housing Executiversquos South Down area manager, Liam Gunn, has explained why the Good Neighbours make Great Neighbourhoods campaign is important.ldquoOur estates are full of phenomenal people like Michaela, who make living in their community so special. This is why, as part of our th birthday celebrations, we are recognising them through this campaign, he said.ldquoMichaela has played a pivotal role in Ballymote for years.

A number of children have to cross the road on their way to school and it is essential that it is safe to do so, he continued.ldquoA pelican crossing can help achieve that and I hope that the roads minister will look favourably upon my request. This is a critically important issue that must be addressed.Cllr Curran said it is his understanding that the recent incident involving a child at the Downpatrick Road ldquocould have been quite serious and hopes that action will be taken to prevent any kind of repeat.He said pupils who attend the busy primary range in age from  to  and in addition to his request to Mrs Mallon, he would be keen to meet meet with roads officials on site.ldquoIt is a very serious situation when drivers are not obeying the speed limit, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoA new pelican crossing would require drivers to come to a complete stop to allow children to cross safely..Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe recent incident involving a child has reinforced the need for a dedicated road crossing and I hope that the Department for Infrastructure will respond positively to my request.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12790188.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Jonathan Porter PresseyeThis would mean it would be entitled to nominate for the First Minister post for the first time, with the deputy First Minister role going to the largest unionist party.Both the First and deputy First Minister posts have equal powers and one cannot be in office without the other.The DUP’s Paul Givan currently holds the First Minister post and Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill is deputy First Minister.But unionist parties have refused to confirm whether they would support an Executive which has a Sinn Fein First Minister.Mr Beattie was asked for clarity during an appearance on the BBC.He said: “We are seven months from an election. I have no idea what the environment is going to be seven months from now.“The Ulster Unionist Party will be going into the election to be the largest party in Northern Ireland. We are aiming to be the First Minister.”Asked againhe would take part in an Executive with a Sinn Fein First Minister, Mr Beattie said: “I am not telling people what my tactics are going to be seven months out from an election.“Everything is tactics. The number of candidates I am going to run is tactics, everything that we put in our manesto will outline where we are going to be. We are playing for number one.”DUP MP Mr Wilson was asked the same question.He said: “As far as we are concerned, we will be going to the electorate at the forthcoming election, whenever that happens to be, asking the people of Northern Ireland to ensure that those who wrecked our country for  years, those who want to tear our country out of the United Kingdom and those who can’t even show any respect to unionist traditions, that they should not become the biggest party in the representation of Northern Ireland.“I don’t answer hypothetical questions.”But Sinn Fein’s junior minister in the Executive, Declan Kearney, said Northern Ireland cannot go back to “majoritarianism”.“It sounds very clearly that Sammy Wilson is advancing a rejectionist agenda of powersharing,” he said.“Sinn Fein will continue to represent all citizens in this society, regardless of their background. I make no distinction between anyone in this society, I reject the idea that we can go back to majoritarianism.“That is what got this society into the mess that it lived through for  years.”Doug BeattieSinn FeinSammy WilsonNorthern IrelandFirst Minister  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsGAA club pressed to give explanation about photos of dissident eventWorkman sent videos of himself masturbating over women’s photos in their homesDUP Ministers urged to quit roles by unionist rival Jim Allister after High Court rules boycott of North-South meetings unlawfulDundalk court case opens against NI men preaching against homosexualityMost PopularUK could suspend Northern Ireland Protocol to safeguard peace, says FrostMinisters: We can assure you that Fathers Alec Reid and Gerry Reynolds were not IRA sympathisersMan accused of killing cyclist Shaun Mullan, , by careless driving acquittedRuth Dudley Edwards: Sinn Fein is the driving force in the Irish demonisation of Israel‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark Gourley                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The firm has been a successful firm for the last  years but, like many firms in the building industry, struggled during the COVID- pandemic.A family business, it was a major employer in the Co Armagh, Down and Antrim areas and had a fleet of around  company vehicles covering all areas of NI. Their services included mechanical, electrical, planned works, response maintenance, disabled adaptations and refurbishment of homes and offices.According to its website, its clients include the South Ulster Housing Association, Connswater Homes, NB Housing Abbeyfield, Clanmil Housing Group and Rural Housing Association.It is understood the workforce were told they would not be paid for last week’s work but would be entitled to claim for a government redundancy payment.Statement from the NI Housing ExecutiveA Housing Executive said: “We are sorry to hear that one of our contractors, JMC Ltd, has announced that it is entering liquidation.“The company was the repairs contractor for our tenants in the Lisburn and Castlereagh area and was also the contractor for a number of improvement schemes across Lisburn and Castlereagh and the Belfast area.“Our priority at this stage is to ensure minimal disruption to services for tenants and those planned maintenance improvement works which are on site.”Statement from North Belfast HousingNB Housingsaid on Twitter last night: “It is with much regret that our main contractor JMC have ceased trading with immediate effect. “This will have an immediate impact on our ability to provide our usual repair service. “We are working to ensure emergency arrangements can be made and we will provide an update asap.”What the politicians saidUpper Bann MP Carla Lockhart said: “This is devastating news and deeply troubling for the employees losing their jobs, and their families.“This is a long standing, well established and respected company that has obviously suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic. “I will be reaching out to management to seeanything can be done. I will also be working with the Economy Minister to see what support can be out in place to help those losing their livelihoods to find new jobs.” Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd said the closure of JMC construction company will be a huge blow for its workers and their families.Mr O’Dowd said: “The closure will see over  workers losing their jobs through no fault of their own.“Those workers have rights and entitlements which must be honoured and their wages and redundancies must be paid.“I will be engaging with all the relevant authorities to ensure those workers who have lost their jobs receive the monies owed to them and their families.”SDLP Upper Bann MLA Dolores Kelly said her thoughts are with staff after the closure of JMC Mechanical and Construction.The Upper Bann MLA said: “The news that JMC Mechanical and Construction has entered liquidation will come as a huge shock and blow to the company’s staff, with up to  jobs lost as a result of this announcement. My thoughts are with them and their families at this dficult time. I am heartened to hear that a number of employees have already secured jobs and hope the rest will soon, especially at a time when skilled tradespeople are in such high demand.“My office is open for those affected and we will offer any help and support we can and I’ll also be raising this situation with the Economy Minister to seethere are any steps he can take to help those involved.“The loss of over  jobs will be devastating to people across Armagh, Down and Antrim where this company operated, This is the latest in a long line of mass job losses we have experienced and we need to see action from the Executive to protect jobs and encourage investment in these areas to regenerate employment.”Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie said: “The news of JMC contracts entering liquidation is a massive blow for staff and their families. My thoughts are with those who have now lost their jobs, in what is already a dficult time for many financially.“JMC has been operating for over  years and it is devastating to see them suffer due as a result of the pandemic.“I believe some local companies have come forward to offer jobs to some of those  workers, this will be good news for some, but others will still be left in limbo and we need to make sure they receive the support needed.“This of course has a knock-on effect for housing associations who will now have to find new contractors and I would ask those who need repairs to please be patient while these associations work to ensure those emergency repairs can be made.”Claims of rise in ‘gang culture’ in Portadown after child threatened with macheteEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

His first film “Before my Time”was nominated at the Learning on Screen Awards in London. Paul has directed internationally, notably winning best doc at the Peace On Earth Film Festival. In his spare time Paul enjoyed fishing and playing music.Paul was a key figure in founding a TV studio at Lurgan Junior High before moving into social enterprise LJHSTV.In  he spent five days in Washington DC after being specially invited to attend the President’s Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge conference - a testament to the impact his films have had on an international scale.At that stage he was the Creative Director of LJHSTV and was asked to showcase his film, ‘Ticking the Box ’ at the conference and it was warmly received by an eclectic mix of viewers.Among the vast collection of global influencers, Paul even got a glimpse of the US President as Barrack Obama addressed the conference via video link.The purpose of the conference was to bring together faith and education leaders from across the globe, and Paul seized the opportunity to exchange ideas and ambitions with his international counterparts.“There was a German professor there who absolutely loved the film,” Paul said at the time, “and he waxed lyrical about it! It went down really well.”He also received an invitation to Kosovo to film - focusing on inter-faith issues.This was not be the first time Paul had established connections in distant lands. Several friends travelled down from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to attend the film screening at the conference and sat on a  to answer questions and spark a debate after the film was shown.Paul and his small team - consisting of Thomas Glass, his fellow company director, and Paul’s we, Marina - have been singled out again and again for being creators of a unique style of filmmaking. Their approach is one fuelled by curiosity: always questioning and approaching issues from an alternative perspective.LJHSTV were no strangers to making waves on both sides of the Atlantic, with their first film having a big impact on home soil - setting out to question the absence of The Troubles in children’s education here.The film ‘Before My Time’ acted as a catalyst to thinking about changes in the history curriculum.It started when Marina took students to Harrisburg for Martin Luther King Day. When they ed, they decided to make a film - not about racism, but about sectarianism. It was championed by one of the history inspectors, and was shown to history teachers across the country.Building his projects around the areas of education and community engagement, Paul was a great believer in the capabilities and talents of young people - shaped by his time as teacher at Lurgan Junior High School.Paul’s we, Marina, works as a teacher in Lurgan, and usually conducts interviews on the films he and Thomas made.Lurgan Junior High paid tribute to Paul on its Facebook page: “The Principal, Governors and staff or Lurgan Junior High School deeply regret the passing of Paul Moorhead, former teacher at our school, and husband of our esteemed colleague Mrs Moorhead, and extend to her and the family our deepest sympathy at this sad time.”Read this:- Construction firm in liquidationEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
