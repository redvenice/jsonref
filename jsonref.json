The Government wants to reopen the hospitality industry as early as July 4.However, many businesses have said the two-metre rule would need to be reduced to one metre to make it commercially viable.

Afterwards, on May 9, I wrote a follow-up letter to Mr Gove emphasising my horror of lion farming, sham trophy-hunting and the bone trade.I also underlined the fact that the South African state not only allows mass lion breeding but also overlooks those who breach its quotas.As the law stands, 800 lion skeletons are allowed to leave the country every year. In 2018, South Africa’s then environment minister, Edna Molewa, raised this number to 1,500 skeletons, claiming it was sustainable and supposedly supported by solid scientific evidence.After a public outcry, however, Molewa’s highly questionable decision was reversed and the limit of 800 skeletons was restored.Yet those who oppose the trade believe that substantially more than 800 lion skeletons leave South Africa each year. Often this is achieved through fraud, simply by under-declaring the number or weight of bones which are shipped.One study by two charities suggests this deception, possibly carried out in conjunction with corrupt officials, is widespread.I pointed out to Mr Gove that Britain could be more determined to end this through our influence and diplomacy, and argued that everything possible should be done to discourage this industry.I suggested that banning the import of lion body parts to the UK would have a significant impact and raised the possibility of tackling the bone trade by implementing something similar to the very effective UK Bribery Act.The idea was to make it illegal for UK firms to be involved in the shipping, trading or the movement of money associated with bones and that their directors would be liable unless they had taken steps to ensure their firms were not involved. I believe this would encourage companies to take measures to protect themselves.It is no exaggeration to say that the abuse of lions in South Africa has become an industry.

This sinister system has sprouted up in plain sight in South Africa, inflicting misery on this most noble of beasts on an unimaginable scale. My research suggests it is highly likely that there are now at least 12,000 captive-bred lions in the country, against a wild population of just 3,000. Yet, strikingly, just a small number of people – a few hundred – profit from this abusive set-up.

He was born in Oxford in 1946, went to university in Ibadan, Nigeria, is based in Berlin and has spent long periods in Khartoum, Bamako, Cairo and Dakar. He has suggested that the cities choose him: “They call out my name, and if I am fully awake, I hear the call and gradually wend my way toward them.”\u0026nbspHe took this picture at Bar Beach on Victoria Island in Lagos in 2006. The woman in her white Sunday robes stands in curious relation to the three deck chairs. In other pictures in an ongoing series from the beach – Sea Never Dry – white tourists sit in similar chairs watching the procession of workers and schoolchildren pass by on the sand. Here the chairs are empty, and the woman expresses a quiet gesture of expectation or supplication, almost lost against the pale greys of sea and sky. The picture sets the tone of a retrospective of Akinbiyi’s work in Berlin entitled Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air. Lagos is a city of nearly 20 million people, yet in among the frenzy of street scenes, Akinbiyi’s camera invariably locates little moments of stillness, like cool alleyways of time.\u0026nbspAkinbiyi studied literature before he became a photographer and his model has always been Langston Hughes, the great poet of the Harlem renaissance. In particular he has been drawn to Hughes’s philosophy, encapsulated in the title of his autobiography, I Wonder As I Wander. Like Hughes, Akinbiyi is a walking artist, part of the scene he describes, waiting for images to make sense around him. When he was interviewed about his Berlin show, and asked about his photographic technique, he preferred to talk of conscious breathing, of finding the mental space in the midst of frantic urban busyness to see what might actually be going on.\u0026nbspAkinbode Akinbiyi: Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air is at Gropius Bau, Berlin, until 19 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf659f34c6db1fec8de8326097dcfe7c71d9cf51/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd4749f1f00e4abe131b3ea35ef82c1","title":"yinka ilori colourful world london nigeria public spaces","story":"The British Nigerian designer on thinking big, bright and positive Walking into Yinka Ilori’s west London studio from the drab suburban business park outside is to enter an oasis. Floor-to-ceiling shelving is lined with the brightly coloured, upcycled chairs, painted or upholstered in West African fabrics, that made Ilori’s name when he first left college. Lush houseplants are dotted around and a portrait of his smiling grandmother sits behind his desk, resplendent in a gele, a traditional head tie. He refers to the picture as we talk about his family’s influence on his work.“My work is very much about inclusivity and how people enjoy design,” says the 33-year-old. There is also a sense of story, of people communicating, something that started at London politan University when he was in his second year studying product and furniture design. He was set a project called Our Chair, which referenced Italian designer Martino Gamper’s 100 Chairs in 100 Days (Gamper transformed 100 discarded chairs into entirely new, brilliantly sculptural pieces).“That was my introduction to Gamper in 2008,” says Ilori. “I thought it was incredible: old objects, new stories, new functions. Simple, but so powerful. That’s what I love – storytelling and exploring memories through design.”Ilori ran with the idea. He scavenged chairs from skips and picked up those dumped on the street. He also incorporated his own history into his designs. Ilori is British with Nigerian parents: his father, a manager for B\u0026ampQ, and his mother, who first ran a corner shop – “I was very popular with my friends as we’d get our sweets after school” – and now cooks professionally for large events, raised Ilori and his two brothers and sister on an estate in north London.“You’re told you are Nigerian at home, but then you go to school and you’re British,” he says. “I lived in Essex Road in Islington, which is a really multicultural neighbourhood and that was nice, so I had the best of both worlds. But it was only when I visited Nigeria that I really got it. I got it that respect is hugely important for my parents: the culture, the language. I get why my parents wear a lot of colour. I understand their journey, their graft. I tried to complain less and respect the fact that they could leave Nigeria and start afresh. And so surely I can make something of myself here? That’s what I try to do.”His Nigerian heritage also appears in his designs. The parables that his parents told him as a child became an inspiration, the morality tales taking on new meaning now he was working to make a career for himself. Some chairs referred to the idea of hierarchy, the huge ide between rich and poor he saw firsthand in Nigeria. For some seats, he’d imagine very particular stories for their owners. Histories based on people he’d known at school who were headed for trouble, boys who had been abandoned by teachers, boys who didn’t fit in because English wasn’t their first language.Post-degree and after a three-month internship with the furniture designer Lee Broom (“I learned a lot from him”), Ilori applied for a £3,000 loan from the Prince’s Trust, wrote a 10-page business plan, and was off. “I wanted to be in the design industry, so I went away to work out who I wanted to be and how I was going to tell my story.”Johanna Agerman Ross, curator of 20th century and contemporary furniture and product design at the V\u0026ampA, nominated Ilori to take part in a project with the Danish textile brand Kvadrat . “I discovered Yinka when he was working with the Restoration Project, a charity in east London that brought together people in need of respite from difficult circumstances to restore old furniture. For me it was a simple, but effective way of using design as a communication and interaction tool. It’s clever and intuitive and, for me, really sums up Yinka.”The Kvadrat project is a group exhibition showcasing furniture created by 28 different designers using its Febrik material – Ilori’s project focuses on interaction: a key theme for the British-Nigerian designer. “We’ve created a crosshatch, four-way bench,” he explains. “In a public space you might find a bench fixed to the ground and that’s it. This is created so that four people can sit on it and change it around. It allows them to engage.” The upholstered seat is called A Trifle of Colour and is covered in Febrik’s ice cream-sprinkle pattern fabric. It has wooden backrest spindles that can be moved or removed altogether so that users can face in or turn away for their own space.Agerman Ross thinks the way Ilori proclaims his culture in such a forthright way is positive. “He foregrounds his British-Nigerian heritage so strongly – that’s one of the first things he says about himself when he presents his work. The design scene as a whole tends to focus on the northern hemisphere and there isn’t enough interaction with different cultures. In that regard Yinka as an artist is a really positive presence.”During a speech Ilori gave at the South African Design Indaba festival in 2017, so his audience might better understand his Nigerian background and its important to his work, he recreated one of his parents’ house parties on stage during his lecture. Kenyan musician “Blinky” Bill Sellanga DJed, and fellow lecturers and audience members danced. His vision of Nigerian culture feels celebratory and joyous, and that is apparent in his work. There’s a sense of Nigerian sunlight, energy, music and family in the forms, colours and patterns of just about everything he designs.“I’ve also grown up watching my mother and grandmother style themselves. How confident and bold they were with colour combinations. It’s beautiful.”Ilori founded his four-person studio in 2017 and the last few years have proved transformational for the designer and his team. A very conscious move from being known as the “guy who does colour” and upcycling (a word that Ilori isn’t fond of: “I prefer pre-loved”) to taking on public projects on a greater scale.In June 2019 there was a playground installation for Pinterest shown at the Cannes Lion International Festival of Creativity, which encouraged adults to cut loose and play, followed by an immersive exhibition design at Somerset House in London for Get Up, Stand Up Now – a show celebrating 50 years of black creativity in the UK. Ilori also created the highly successful Happy Street, a permanent enamel-panelled installation under a bridge in Battersea’s Thessaly Road, after winning a competition run by the London Festival of Architecture and the local council. And last summer he won another contest with The Colour Palace , a wooden pavilion inspired by Lagos markets, installed in the grounds of the Dulwich Picture Gallery during the festival. It has given Ilori a taste for more architectural-scale projects.“There’s a great honesty and integrity in his approach and a real belief in the ability of good design and colour to uplift a place and uplift people,” says Tamsie Thomson, the festival’s director, who commissioned Happy Street and The Colour Palace. “That’s why he won both competitions. The underpass was hideous. It’s right next to a school and is heavily used by pedestrians. The impact that a piece like his has on improving everybody’s daily life is huge.“From the London Festival of Architecture’s perspective, that’s really important to us – improving the everyday. Yinka and I have a standing joke that he’s not going to be happy until he’s done an airport, but that’s where I can see it ending up, with really significant commissions way beyond the level he’s getting now,” she says.Ilori’s confidence is rising as his projects increase in scale and ambition. “I like the idea of doing civic projects, but wasn’t sure that I could do it until now. Before doing the underpass in Battersea, I was scared of working with engineers and architects, but having done it and then the pavilion, I’m really hungry for more. I love that people will have access to my work – that makes me really happy. Architecture and design should be for everyone.”Ilori’s 2020 has been rerouted like everyone else’s. Projects have been pushed back or fallen away during lockdown. “But actually I’ve been looking at how to use this time positively,” he says when we speak in May. “I’ve spent a lot of time developing ideas during these months of being forced to slow down and evaluate.”Time alone in his studio has led to the development of a homeware range. “I’ve been meaning to do it for ages – plates, bowls, trays and mugs – people have also been asking for upholstery fabric so we’re working on that.”He has also created a public art installation in response to Covid-19 in support of the NHS in a poster space at Blackfriars in Southwark. It’s inspired by sketches for the A\u0026ampE department at Chelsea \u0026amp Westminster hospital.

Its frame is narrow – three women in their 70s, a Christmas weekend – but Wood zooms in for revealing, intimate close-ups.The trio have gathered to clean out their dead friend Sylvie’s beach house. Naturally, this prompts the women to take inventories of their own lives too: achievements and failures, griefs and lost opportunities. And what’s uncovered makes them reassess the stories they hold about the lives they’ve led.Adele is an actor, now broke and forgotten she’s obsessed with maintaining her good figure, revelling in sensual pleasure. By contrast, Jude is rigid, uptight she ran restaurants for years and likes to provide, but is also judgmental, impatient. She’s especially exasperated by Wendy, a lightly chaotic feminist scholar, bringing her ancient dog, Finn, a gift from Sylvie after Wendy’s husband died. Wood affectingly captures the emotional dependence we can feel for pets, although Finn’s decrepitude can be used a little heavy-handedly as an end-of-life symbol.Sylvie, however, remains unknown, missing for the reader as for her friends. Personally, I’d rather have been able to slot this final puzzle piece in. But Wood finds a beautiful balance between her three women, swivelling between their perspectives on the present and their shared past. The gaps between how a character sees themselves and how their friends see them are astutely drawn, both painfully comic and frequently heartbreaking.Although an enjoyable read, The Weekend does focus on the bleaker aspects of ageing and the frustrations and irritations of friendships rather than the joys. Avoiding the wise-old-woman trope is itself wise, but I felt that three such formidable figures would find positive new perspectives in growing old. Instead, ageing is presented as a regrettable, humiliating thing.Still, Wood is to be praised for taking female friendship seriously and for being caustically honest – there’s not a sentimental line in this beautifully insightful book. •\u0026nbsp The Weekend by Charlotte Wood is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson (£14.99).

Covid-19 looks to be the sort of virus that sticks around. The number of new cases has been on a downward trend for weeks as a result of the severest curbs on the UK population ever imposed in peacetime and the arrival of warmer weather, but what happens in the autumn when restrictions have been further eased and the temperature starts to drop? If the trend is reversed, does the government lock down the economy a second time ?The answer is: almost certainly not, even though it was this possibility that spooked financial markets last week. Share prices crashed in the early stages of the crisis because investors grasped that measures taken to control the pandemic would result in much weaker corporate profits. Markets subsequently rallied fast because the tentative easing of lockdown restrictions raised hopes of a V-shaped recession. They then had second thoughts after an increase in new Covid-19 cases in a number of US states, mainly in the south. The city of Houston in Texas is mulling the possibility of once again ordering people to stay in their homes. A partial shutdown has been imposed in Beijing after the city reported its first cases of Covid-19 in almost two months.This is likely to be the template for the months ahead: a targeted, localised approach rather than a blanket ban on activity. Political leaders are going to be wary of reimposing full lockdowns, and they are right to be wary.For a start, it has become clear that there is no such thing as “the science” when it comes to Covid-19. Immunologists have different views about infection rates and possible mortality outcomes in the same way that monetarists and Keynesians differ over economics.Ministers felt they had no option but to adopt a safety-first approach when the Covid-19 crisis broke in March because there was a genuine risk that an uncontrolled pandemic would overwhelm the NHS. Every person who had contracted the virus was infecting three others.Three months on things look different. The NHS coped and the extra capacity installed through the Nightingale hospitals was not needed. The R number – the reproduction rate at which the virus spreads – has come down from three to one, or just below.As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, the crisis has deepened Britain’s class, ethnic, gender and generational ides. Young people are the least likely demographic group to be infected with Covid-19 but they are being particularly hard hit by the lockdown. The cost of school closures for all children, but especially those from poorer households, will be high. The 18-24 age group are most likely to end up unemployed because many of them work in hospitality, retailing and leisure.The likelihood that Covid-19 will resurface a second, and perhaps a third or fourth time, makes the case for a measured approach to future lockdowns even stronger. All the evidence is that six months without going to school is more than twice as damaging as three months absence from the classroom. The same applies to youth unemployment: the longer the spell out of work the deeper the scars.Getting young people to abide by a second lockdown would be problematical. They want to work, to meet their mates, go on demonstrations, have some fun. They know they are low risk and will do their own cost-benefit analysis. Many will simply not comply, deciding instead that Covid-19 is a risk they are prepared to accept.This is not a bad philosophy because until a vaccine is found there is a choice. Either countries such as Britain use effective track and trace systems to deal with local hotspots and let the rest of the country operate as near to normal as possible, or they shut everything down again. If they haven’t already done so, governments will conclude that the economic, social, health and educational costs of full lockdowns are too high and that somehow we have to learn to live with Covid-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c672a75477f8eae9e12a987e5b0e3480cefedee9/0_36_1117_670/master/1117.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fb71c5b756a4366b222da93ba58a7fff","title":"top public school accused of toxic culture of racism among pupils","story":"Letter from Westminster alumni demands changes to teaching of black cultureMore than 250 former pupils at Westminster School have signed a letter demanding that it combat the “toxic culture of racism within the student body”, promote the teaching of black culture and confront its links with the slave trade.It is one of the first indications that Britain’s public school system is now coming under pressure to follow the example of many universities and examine how it tackles racial and colonial issues.The letter, to the outgoing headmaster Patrick Derham and his replacement, Dr Gary Savage, explains how “recent events surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement” have forced the pupils to examine what they were taught at the prestigious school whose political alumni include Nick Clegg and Dominic Grieve.While praising the school for “taking a constructive approach to learning”, the former pupils said “our education fell short in educating us about the great privilege that we had as predominantly white students of a public school”.The pupils complain that during their time at the school they did not read a single book by a black author and that black history and Britain’s role in the slave trade were largely ignored.“Schools such as Westminster, with all its privilege and power, have a duty to ensure its students are actively anti-racist, and equipped to contribute to a fairer and more equitable society,” the pupils claim. The letter notes that the school has a house named after Richard Hakluyt, who promoted the English colonisation of the Americas, and boasts a society named after John Locke, whose Constitutions of Carolina justified slavery. It also has a statue to Elizabeth I, whom the pupils describe as “the monarch who began the English colonial project”.The UCL Legacies of British Slave ownership website reveals that Westminster School has at least 28 alumni linked to the slave trade. These include William Beckford, a former lord mayor of London who inherited an estate in Jamaica with 3,000 slaves.Dr Miranda Kaufmann, a historian whose blog promotes greater understanding of black British history, welcomed the pupils’ intervention.“There’s been quite a lot of movement on this among universities over the last couple of years but I’m not very conscious of many schools doing much. But … the pupils need to think personally about what they can do as well.”The letter also claimed that racist incidents at Westminster had been brushed aside.“It would be great to hear from you what concrete measures you have taken, or intend to take, to reverse a longstanding toxic culture of racism within the student body, which has long gone unpunished,” the pupils ask in their letter.In a statement, Westminster said it had established a “challenging racism committee” made up of staff and pupils and that it was reviewing its procedures to identify ways in which it could “ensure a erse school community that is truly reflective of the multicultural city in which we live”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ceb82e8fc86ca40d78d67f86eabac18dc7bc5d/0_1590_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bf0af661816c0c3c3a2dbb6b8f24ba5","title":"margaret howell 50 years design katharine hepburn","story":"This year, Howell celebrates 50 years in design, from postwar austerity and men’s shirts for women to becoming a British national treasureIt’s half a century since Margaret Howell first ran her fingers over the cotton of the white shirt she is holding, but it still elicits a grin. “It’s that I was excited about,” she says, “Do you feel it? I wanted that softness, proper shirting and all the detail of buttons and buttonholes, but without any of the stiffness.” That feel was something she had first found in markets and jumble sales after she left art school in London in 1969. She initially used to refashion the old Jermyn Street shirts she rummaged for, and then, having sourced the precise weight of Egyptian cotton from David \u0026amp John Anderson in Glasgow, started to make her own.The shirt Howell is holding is in the basement archive of her shop on Margaret Street in London. It is “filed” on a rack with some of her other original pieces, all made nearly 50 years ago, and lovingly retained, along with drawings and adverts and photos and press clippings that chart the beginnings of her eponymous brand. From those beginnings Howell has established not only her landmark Wigmore Street store up the road, but a global presence that includes outlets in Paris and Florence and New York, more than 100 shops in Japan and revenues in excess of £100m a year.Howell is a spirited 73, slim and nervily self-effacing, in dark jeans and a green wool sweater. When she talks about the clothes she has made and kept, you are also aware she is talking about her life. Associations bleed into each other. A beautiful unlined linen jacket on the archive rack, another first that has become a staple, brings back childhood images of “men on the seafront, on the south coast, with their Sunday jackets on”. And also memories of her grandfather, who had a barber shop in Walton-on-the-Hill in Surrey, and a Victorian house where he grew peaches up the garden wall. And of visits to his sisters – Howell’s aunts – who lived in a Nissen hut on the South Downs, “built up on stilts, with a laundry underneath”, which Howell and her two sisters would visit on summer Sundays and then go swimming in the sea at Rottingdean.Other fabrics in the archive bring other memories. There is the memory of the worn gabardine of a coat that her father – an army captain in the war – gardened in, and the smell of bonfire smoke that it carried when he came up to read her a bedtime story. A corduroy jacket that recalls the style of a geography teacher at her school, which prompted her to find the best corduroy from a maker near Hebden Bridge. And then the trademark tweeds, Harris and Irish, that bring to her mind “going out from primary school and out on to the common and sitting on tufts of dry grass in the summer. Something of that feel.”All of these sensory elements were part of Howell’s original collections in the late 1970s and 1980s and they remain the cornerstones of her collections today. It is one thing to feel the associations of fabrics, it is another to bring them so consistently to life. “I don’t think I was consciously reacting to any of this,” she says, looking back on the five decades she is somewhat reluctantly (“it’s not really my thing”) celebrating. “I just had a sense of what I liked: clothes that were soft and casual and slightly oversized. I was always out of doors growing up and you needed clothes that you could move in easily.”Howell was born immediately after the war, in 1946, a fact that seems crucial to her aesthetic. She is a dozen years younger than Mary Quant, for example, and felt a different sense of liberation to the hedonism of the 1960s. She made her own clothes in her teens, but, she insists, putting the side of her hand to her jeans, her hemlines were never shorter than just above the knee. She was drawn rather to the understatement of Jean Muir. To the trouser suits of Yves Saint Laurent. “I loved the way that Katharine Hepburn wore men’s trousers,” she says, “or what seemed to be men’s trousers.” At school she remembers looking long and hard at the brown pin-striped suit of another female teacher, “which was deeply unfashionable, but which I knew I might be able to do something with”.Howell’s mother had worked in a dress shop in Reigate and had a style of her own. “She never went to the hairdresser’s like the other mums – my sister and I used to cut her hair – and she let it go grey.” They did not have much money, but at Christmas her mother would take her girls up to Selfridges, not only to look in the windows, but to buy them something that might last, like a Braemar wool cardigan. Or they would take trips up to Dickins \u0026amp Jones to choose some cotton for a dress.Her older sister, Jean, was a maker, too: silk scarves and Fair Isle sweaters. Howell helped with the silk printing before she came across her jumble sale shirts. She had a sense that she was going against the grain of the high street. “Everything that was going out of fashion, I wanted it back in,” she says. “All the traditional elements but done with more looseness, a different feel.” She was always grateful that her mother had never fallen for nylon sheets like everyone else. In terms of the 60s, you might think of it as her hankering for the simplicity of The Long and Winding Road and Mull of Kintyre after the extravagances of Sgt Pepper and the Maharishi.She has stayed true to her tactile inspirations. In her Wigmore Street shop, you have to resist running your fingers over everything. Her design studio is at the back of the store and she is here most days, except Wednesday, when she looks after her youngest, two-year-old granddaughter. She tries to focus on the clothes and leaves running the business to her managing director, Richard Craig. Two mornings a week, through the winter, she swims in the outdoor lido at Charlton, south-east London. She has a cottage near Woodbridge in Suffolk and she swims in the North Sea in the summer.The Suffolk house is the last of a terrace of six designed by the Swiss architect Rudy Mock in 1965: “a very end-of-the-road place”, she says, “and the coast is very raw there, with the North Sea bashing in and eroding it like mad.” She used to come to this coast with her children when they were small. Since her son Edward died in 2011, aged 30, it seems to have become more important to her as a place of refuge. She loves the flatness and the skies and the colours of marsh and lagoon and shingle inform the palette of her clothes.The original label was a collaborative effort with Paul Renshaw, later her husband. They set up the first workshop in their one-bed flat in Blackheath. “We had the bed raised up near the ceiling so we could have the sewing machines underneath,” she says. The kitchen was the office. “It prompted us to get married because the machinists came early and it stopped us having to be embarrassed scrambling around.”When her South Molton Street shop did open in 1977, women came in wanting to look like Annie Hall, and her style found a unisex moment that it has never lost. She used to take her two children, as babies, into the new workshop as the business expanded, but her marriage and her partnership with Renshaw eventually failed, and they orced in 1987. “He got too caught up in the glamour of it, I suppose you might say,” she says.The business had outstretched itself, too, and she saved it by agreeing a partnership with a Japanese businessman, Sam Segure, who wanted to sell her label under licence in Japan. Segure has allowed Howell to keep full control of design, as that business has grown steadily over three decades – even though Howell eventually sold her majority stake to a publicly listed Japanese company.The Japanese operation in particular has made Howell a wealthy woman, but her habits have not changed too much. She lives alone, in London and in Suffolk – she has “a friend” but “we could never live in the same house: he collects a lot of things”, she says with a shudder. Howell was sustainable decades before sustainability became a catwalk mantra. “We were a family that always darned socks,” she says. “As a rule I keep things I like until they wear out. I have had a cotton-linen towel, which is lovely after an open-air swim – and which they don’t really make any more. It is totally worn out, but I still use it. I don’t like having too many things.”That less-is-more philosophy seems woven into her clothes as well as her life. She has three principal designers now, but she insists on going with them to look at fabrics, which is where the magic often happens. She is drawn to things that are made on old looms. “It makes it slightly more irregular and raw,” she says, though she was surprised recently to like a soft white plastic fabric in Japan. “It reminded me of those clear plastic macs we used to have as kids from Woolworths,” she says. “Slightly sticky that lovely smell.”Does she still need to have the last say on everything?“Well it has my name on it, so yes. And I still want to try everything on myself. It is only then that I can feel it, and I can see the proportions more clearly. I still do that with everything we sell.”Her abiding satisfaction comes not from newness, she insists, but from the things that have always sold, and still sell consistently: the corduroys and the linens and the shirts and the tweeds. “That is when you know that everything works about it,” she says. “And that there is nothing at all unnecessary.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

As the latticework rounds crisped in the pan, I grated a fistful of cheese (fontina, but it could have been anything) over the top to melt into the crust, and scattered the surface with young thyme, parsley and sage leaves. I’m not sure what I would call these cakes, or even if it matters. They could go by the name of galette or rosti, potato pancake or fritter. They were only a very short jump from a latke.What matters is that they were delicious. The potatoes, waxy and yellow-fleshed, were rubbed on the coarse side of a box grater, left to drain, then squeezed and tossed with nigella seeds and just enough egg and flour to hold the strands together. Once you get used to it, turning the cake in the pan is easy enough with the help of a fish slice.I also made a rather lovely cream for summer fruits, scented with vanilla and as thick as cheesecake. I leave yogurt and mascarpone in a white cloth to drain, producing a sort of soft cheese in the style of the French faisselle I buy when I can get it, to eat with the smallest strawberries I can get my hands on. This time, we ate it with dried apricots I had poached in a chartreuse mint-leaf syrup.The potato cake and the mint syrup are little celebrations of the young herb leaves around in spring and early summer, those whose flavour is mild and whose texture is fragile. Later in the year, with time spent in the sun, those flavours will be more strident, the leaves of thyme and marjoram too coarse to eat raw.The herbs I grow are all in pots. There would usually be more in my garden than I have now but the local nurseries are stripped bare – making those I do have all the more precious.As you scatter the herbs over the hot, melting cheese and crisp potato, their fragrance wafts up. Use whichever you have that work with cheese. I suggest thyme and its pink flowers, or chives, basil, young sage leaves and tarragon. Use chervil or sweet cicely if you grow it.waxy, yellow fleshed potatoes 650gspring onions 4 thin plain flour 2 tbspnigella seeds 2 tspegg 1, beatengroundnut or vegetable oil 2 tbspfontina 100gherbs 25gScrub the potatoes, or peel if you wish, then grate coarsely in long, thin shreds. I use the coarse grater of a food processor. Put the grated potatoes in a sieve over a bowl and let them drain for 20 minutes.Trim the spring onions, discarding only the roots and tough ends of the shoots, then slice them finely. Season with salt and black pepper, then stir into a bowl with the drained potatoes and the flour, nigella seeds and beaten egg.Warm the oil in a 22-25cm nonstick frying pan, keeping the heat no more than moderately high. Place the potato mix in the pan, spreading it out to fill the base. Don’t be tempted to smooth it flat. The cake is lighter if it isn’t compacted.Let the potato cake cook for 8-10 minutes, regulating the temperature when necessary until the base is crisp and golden. Check its progress by lifting up the edge with a palette knife or slotted slice. Carefully turn the cake over either by lifting with a large metal slice or palette knife, or by placing a plate over the top of the pan and, holding it tightly in place, carefully flipping the pan over, then slide the cake back into the pan.Leave to brown lightly on the underside. Finely grate the cheese over the top of the potato cake leaving a rim around the edge. Place a lid over the pan, remove from the heat and leave for 5 minutes for the cheese to melt.Chop the herb leaves and scatter over the cake. Cut into slices and serve.The Spanish apricots are starting to arrive, although I often use dried apricots for this. caster sugar 90gwater 500mlmint 50gdried apricots 200g or 12 freshFor the mascarpone cream:thick yogurt 150gmascarpone 150gwhite caster sugar 145gdouble cream 125mlvanilla extract a few dropsTo make the cream, put the yogurt in the bowl of a food mixer. Add the mascarpone and caster sugar and beat for a minute or two until well combined.

Smooth the surface then gather the overhanging cloth together and twist tightly. Place the sieve over a bowl to catch any drips then refrigerate for at least 6 hours. During its time in the fridge the cream will firm and thicken.For the apricots, put the sugar in a small pan, add the water and bring to the boil. Remove the mint leaves from their stems, finely chop and add to the syrup. Add the apricots, lower the heat and leave to simmer till the fruit is tender. The exact time will depend on whether you are using dried fruit (about 10 minutes) or fresh (8-20 depending on their ripeness).Leave the fruit to cool in its syrup. Pound the extra mint leaves and sugar in a mortar and pestle to a green paste then sprinkle over the apricots as you serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16204996571abe5f3b0e2cb28631a8aaedb3bf95/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb6ceeaa596139cb2d304f1a50e2482","title":"favourite european championship euro 2020","story":"Whether it’s the first you remember, the first you attended or the tournament your team won, we want to hear about itWhat a weekend of football we had in store.

But maybe playing in an empty stadium after such a long shutdown will throw form out of the window? Maybe.Is it right to restart? I’m not sure it’s moral to ask players to risk infection for themselves and their families just to give us some entertainment. And the sanitised experience is going to be strange. It’s been bizarre to see subs distanced and masked in the Bundesliga while, on the pitch, the players are puffing and panting over each other.What I missed most … Having had to make do with press gossip about the futures of Aubameyang, Saka and co, I just can’t wait for some actual sport.What I missed least … I’ve missed all of it: the agony and the ecstasy. The only positive has been the chance to watch the replays of our former glories and be reminded what a privilege it’s been to watch Arsenal over the past half a century. I just hope the current squad were watching too.Has the club had a good lockdown? As a shielded resident of Highbury I’ve been waiting patiently these past three months for Mesut Özil to turn up on my doorstep with some groceries. It’s not happened yet, but the club’s support for the community has been admirable.We were absolutely dead and buried before the break: confidence shot, it looked grim. However, with McGinn back and Grealish’s 122 foul-induced bruises now healed, suddenly everything seems possible. With a bit of luck we could just scrape survival. It’s a shame Covid-19 chose this year to close grounds, though: after 20 years of Villa Park being mostly quiet or moany, in the last three it has been bouncing. The absence of fans is a disadvantage to us, with six of our 10 games at home.Is it right to restart? I suppose so, although I have always been in the “bin it off, no relegation, let Leeds and Albion come up” camp. Self-interested? Of course! Anyway, I’ve applied for a job as a ballboy for Wednesday’s game but I haven’t heard back. Ageism.What I missed least … Feeling I have to watch Grealish’s body language every second, praying not to see signs he’s had enough of how rubbish we are.Has the club had a good lockdown? Positives: plenty of good community work. Negatives: Grealish is proof that it is possible to be both the messiah and a very naughty boy at the same time.Our prospects have improved a lot since March, with the return of Cook and Brooks in particular – and Liverpool have let us keep Harry Wilson for the run-in. It’s going to be tough, with four of the top six to play, but we’ll battle. We may just scrape home.Is it right to restart? The low number of positive Covid-19 tests among players is reassuring but clearly the restart is just about money. Only a third of games are free on TV. Personally I’d have abandoned the season on safety grounds – even if it did mean automatic relegation.What I missed most … Apart from the football, it’s meeting other fans. You have a routine when you go to games, and we’ve missed that hugely.What I missed least … Talking about VAR. I just hope it has a quiet run-in, then something serious is done for the following season to change the system. It’s been a shambles.Has the club had a good lockdown? Mostly. Eddie Howe was first to volunteer a pay cut players and staff contacted fans and made donations. Jordon Ibe let the side down, though: breaching lockdown to visit a celebrity hairdresser, then boasting about it on Instagram. He’s leaving next month.Anxiety is running high. We’ve got Liverpool, Man City, Arsenal and Man United at home. With a crowd we’d have got a couple of points from those. Now I’m not so sure. But, then again, it doesn’t feel like the same season so hopefully instead of falling apart and conceding stupid goals, we’ll have forgotten we haven’t won a game this year and return refreshed, ready to bang in a couple of vital early wins.Is it right to restart? Yes and no. Yes because it’ll be a distraction from the misery of the pandemic and our unbelievably incompetent government. No because it’s all being driven by the TV money: sickening when so many people have lost so much and have years of hardship ahead. Having the Premier League awash with so much money has never felt right if a couple of zeros can be knocked off players’ salaries and agents’ fees as a result of all this it’d feel a whole lot better.What I missed most … The whole shebang of match day - meeting friends in the pub, the anticipation, the noise, unbridled joymisery, plus reading, talking and thinking about football every single day of the week.What I missed least … Listening to fans’ vitriol during games. And drinking so many pints of fizzy lager in plastic cups.Has the club had a good lockdown? They stepped up again: a huge donation to a local charities, and Albion In The Community continued its amazing work.We’re in a pretty comfortable position: there’s no likelihood of being dragged into a relegation battle. Dyche has the squad in good shape. It’s probably the smallest squad in the league, though, so the new substitute rule won’t work in our favour – and the quick turnaround could hit us if we get a couple of injuries.Is it right to restart? It’ll be good to see some games, of course, albeit in a strange setting – but with the pandemic still taking so many lives in the UK it’s hard to argue with those who think it is the wrong thing to do.What I missed most … It’s been like a close season, but this time with little connection with football friends. That’s what I’ve missed more than anything: those long away trips and the company that goes with them are a big loss. There were still some really good weekends away to look forward to.What I missed least … Losing - but we hadn’t been doing that very often at the time of the lockdown.Has the club had a good lockdown? We’ve had no negatives in terms of squad behaviour. We don’t have a Jack GrealishKyle WalkerDominic Cummings here. The club as a whole stepped up: they’ve done well to support the most vulnerable, particularly with food deliveries.Feels a bit strange to restart – like a mini new season rather than completing the old one. We seem to be injury-free and we’ve got a good young squad, so I fully expect us to finish in the top four and win the FA Cup. I’m not sure I’d back us for the Champions League, though …Is it right to restart? I keep changing my mind. It was never about the integrity of the league: it was all about money. The Premier League should have come straight out and said that: I think most fans would have appreciated the honesty. Having tried to watch some of the German football I’m still not convinced it’s the real thing – it feels more like glorified friendlies.What I missed most … The social side: the pub, beer and the moaning – all as important as the game itself. Football without fans is nothing, and we’ll see that over the next few weeks.What I missed least … Football fan video bloggers. Oh, and the media fawning over Liverpool. The thought of Liverpool winning the league is bad enough without the 247 rolling coverage.Has the club had a good lockdown? Chelsea responded positively: they’ve supported the NHS and local charities from the start. By way of contrast, the likes of Liverpool and Spurs using the furlough scheme was embarrassing.• Paul Baker In memory of Trizia FiorellinoWe’d built up a bit of momentum before the lockdown, with three wins on the spin and surging up the table. The squad is fully fit now, but who knows what sharpness is going to be like … With a reasonably difficult run-in, a top-10 finish would be a great success.Is it right to restart? Absolutely. Once the safety of players and match‑day staff was established there was every reason to restart – both for the obvious financial reasons, but also for the morale-boosting effect it’ll have on football supporters everywhere.What I missed most … Not so much the matches themselves, but rather the friends you meet beforehand in the pub or sit with at the match, as well as the wider football chat in person and online. I didn’t realise how much structure football gave my life until it was gone.What I missed least … Queuing for a beer. Queuing for toilets. And those abject defeats that hang over you like a cloud until the next match.Has the club had a good lockdown? The chairman took a lead in pushing for the Premier League to come back – he’s come across well in the media. The club have been impressive all round: not furloughing staff, continuing charity outreach to vulnerable youngsters and providing free meals to NHS staff.We’re in a very precarious state. With Mina injured we have just two experienced centre-backs in Holgate and Keane. Given the high injury rate in Germany since their restart that’s an obvious worry. Gbamin’s injury also makes midfield extremely light. Players such as Walcott who are always susceptible to soft-tissue injuries make the situation even further stretched.Is it right to restart? No. It’s been driven by the financial consequences of not delivering a complete season to the broadcasters. Years of financial mismanagement by the clubs and poor relationships between the league and broadcasters are coming home to roost.What I missed most … The buildup to games, the anticipation and the predictions among friends, followed by the post-match debate and arguments. The games themselves, not so much.What I missed least … Pundits! If broadcasters could just let the football do the talking and leave the punditry out it’d do us all a favour …Has the club had a good lockdown? They continued to excel in community work, and they’ve also been fantastic employers, maintaining and paying all positions. Communications and engagement regarding the restart have been very poor, though.It’s going to be a nervous run-in. It feels like the start of a new campaign, except there’s so much more to lose, especially for us. I have to hope the coaches have kept to the usual high standards and that everyone is fit and raring to go. More of the same will do nicely.Is it right to restart? I don’t think so. The aftershocks of the pandemic will be felt in football for years to come. Restarting after such a long break was just as unfair as all the other possibilities. I think we should have ended the season, honoured promotions, qualifications and championships based on current positions and played with 22 clubs in the Premier League until we can gradually return to normal.What I missed most … Just having something to look forward to – a distraction from the endless stream of bad news.What I missed least … Stressing about whether or not we can keep hold of our top-four spot.Has the club had a good lockdown? The club has been tremendous as always – taking much of the financial burden. Our players have made generous personal contributions to Covid-19 relief efforts, too. It’s one aspect we never have to worry about.Our first game is the derby, which I think we’ll win and be on our way. I’m confident we can take up where we left off, perhaps not with the same intensity at first, but I can’t see us not winning most of our games. Six points and we’re champions. It’s been a while.Is it right to restart? Yes. This season needs to finish before we can start to think what’ll happen for the next. Behind closed doors isn’t great but at this stage there’s no other way. Who knows when crowds will be able to gather again, and we’ve already had to play a game – against Atlético Madrid back in March – that we shouldn’t. It looks like it had dire consequences.What I missed most … Seeing Liverpool win the league. Celebrating Liverpool winning the league. Seeing mates. I’ve been asked a few times if I think this title will be tarnished because of the situation? Tarnished? Madness.What I missed least … Travelling at crazy times for crazy kick-offs to suit TV. Oh, and the rubbish you hear (see above).Has the club had a good lockdown? Klopp and the players have done a fair bit of community work and online connection with fans. The club took some stick when they announced they were going to furlough staff, and days later they backtracked. But they did backtrack. Anyone can make mistakes. The reversal came thanks in a large part to pressure from Spirit of Shankly and the club’s willingness to engage with the supporters’ union. The club also worked with SOS to lobby for games to be played at Anfield, not neutral venues. We’ve got an ace squad and the best manager. And pretty soon we’ll have number 19.• Part 2: Manchester City to Wolves"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a322afd01f4b8e8344c19078c478cb3f043a7383/0_97_3430_2057/master/3430.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e1b8bac06927e9ab65d6b63e558abf80","title":"brands fans and influencers why social media for small business is about more than sales","story":"Standing out online can transform a business, but it takes focus and strategy. Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Try to be more understanding, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma When my boyfriend and I first met I was attracted to his open, unrestrained nature. In general, I am still attracted to these qualities in him however, I have become increasingly frustrated with his unrestrained relationship with food.When I was growing up, my mother was always trying to lose weight. Consequently, I am body-conscious, eat well and exercise regularly. My boyfriend eats compulsively – often using food to combat tiredness or uncomfortable emotions – and he also binge-eats in secret. I find evidence of this under the bed and under car seats, and feel frustrated by his self-sabotage. I’m sure that my own inherited fears surrounding weight gain also play a role in my frustration with him.My boyfriend is aware of his issues and we have spoken about them on occasion. I resolved some time ago not to try to control his eating or his body however, I nonetheless find myself growing frustrated by his lack of self-control and even find myself distancing myself from him emotionally when he has been overeating or binge-eating, which ultimately leaves me feeling despondent. I want to respect that he is on his own journey where food is concerned. Do you have any advice that might help me to let go and stop getting so frustrated with him?Mariella replies First of all, let me state the obvious: it’s not about the food. As you’ve already recognised, you can’t and mustn’t become too embroiled in his personal struggles – and certainly not without professional help. I’d urge you both to seek advice from any of the many organisations who are skilled in dealing with eating disorders, including the NHS, Beat and the National Centre for Eating Disorders.You recognise that what’s triggering your frustration may be your own experiences gained from watching your mother, so your focus is on keeping control, and balancing your diet to maintain your perfect level. That over-keen awareness is itself a form of disorder. Ironically your boyfriend represents what you don’t want to be, which makes me wonder why you chose him. Maybe you recognised something familiar in him and by the time you identified what it was you were already hooked. Hopefully, despite feeling judgmental, you’re also aware that your boyfriend’s addiction is coming from a similar place, despite manifesting differently.Food is never the problem, whether we can’t stop eating or we can’t bear to it’s our emotions that we’re struggling to manage. There’s also the issue of control and the lack of it. Some of us witnessing those who struggle to restrain their impulses are triggered into a response that is far more judgmental than sympathetic. I once had a boyfriend perfect in many ways apart for his inability to choose a drink in a restaurant. I promise that’s not a joke. In the course of any meal he’d start with a coffee, then perhaps an orange juice, then a Coke, or a tea and perhaps a glass of wine thrown in for good measure. I’d sit opposite him, paralysed with embarrassment as he called the waitress over yet again. In retrospect I understand that his tendency toward depression, diagnosed later, which made him appear brooding, interesting and Heathcliff-like to my 20-something self, was directly linked to his inability to make choices that satisfied him. Back then, though, I was way too close to my own childhood dysfunctions to empathise with his. Instead it eventually drove us apart. Now I’d hope some inquisitiveness as to the root cause of his struggles and a degree of empathy would replace the swift judgment I was guilty of back then. If you’ve grown up witnessing an addiction or mental health issues in any form you often seek out what’s familiar in those you’re attracted to. Your boyfriend is trapped in a cycle of self-punishment and I’d like to know why. Gorging or starving is an impulse that comes from the same place as all other forms of self-abasement, from sexual addiction to self-harm, and is invariably an expression of something darker and deeper.So your man is damaged goods, that’s for sure but, then again, who isn’t? I think it sometimes helps when an issue sits right in front of your eyes, as it does in this case, so you can at least drag it out into the light and discuss it. Before you decide whether that’s a journey you want to embark on with your boyfriend, you need to look to yourself and try to understand why his issues were initially part of what attracted you to him. It’s up to you to decide whether your desire for this man is built on deep-rooted ancient rubble that’s liable to crumble under pressure, or on solid impulses that will hold steady while you work to discover what truly drives his hunger. Then, of course, there’s his willingness to go on that difficult trek through the past with you.•\u0026nbspComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

But lockdown has lent them a surprising new twist…Since the beginning of lockdown, a new path has sprung up in my local park – it snakes underneath a tree and up (and then down) a small hill, marking the way to the local Sainsbury’s. It is not an official path paved by keen construction workers in the dead of the night, but a “desire path” – a walkway made by hundreds of shuffling feet damaging the grass and eroding the ground beneath them. If “real” paths show us where we should go and how we should get there, then desire paths expose the complicated messiness of humanity. They are visible markers of our autonomy or, at the very least, our undeniable love of shortcuts.Desire paths aren’t anything new – the term has been traced back to the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, who wrote of “lignes de désir” in his 1958 book The Poetics of Space. Nature author Robert Macfarlane has written more recently about the inherent poetry of the paths. In his 2012 book The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot, Macfarlane calls them “elective easements” and says: “Paths are human they are traces of our relationships.” Desire paths have been created by enthusiastic dogs in back gardens, by superstitious humans avoiding scaffolding and by students seeking shortcuts to class. Yet while illicit trails may have marked the easier (ie shorter) route for centuries, the pandemic has turned them into physical markers of our distance. Desire paths are no longer about making life easier for ourselves, but about preserving life for everyone.Michael Mayhew, a 56-year-old artist from Northampton who runs a library of books dedicated to food, has spotted three new desire paths in his local park, The Racecourse. “Because the grass isn’t being cut, you start seeing them. It doesn’t take long for a path to develop,” he says. “There are three all running in the same direction as the functional path – I just found it fascinating.” Mayhew believes the paths demonstrate how considerate people are being about keeping each other safe.But what do desire paths really tell us about ourselves, if anything? Are they poetic – or simply a pain for those who maintain public spaces? And what is the ultimate desire path success story: a path that is officially paved over – demonstrating the democratic power of thousands of feet – or a path that is allowed to remain as a messy marker of our messy lives?Elena Dorato and Gianni Lobosco are academics in the department of architecture at the University of Ferrara in Italy. In 2017, they co-wrote a paper called “Designing Desire”, in which they explored how predictive models could be used to visualise (and possibly pave) desire paths before they emerge. The academics explain that it is not always common for urban planners to base their development decisions on desire paths, and they wanted to explore how behavioural modelling could better inform design decisions. Yet at the same time, the pair don’t necessarily believe paved-over dirt paths are always the most desirable solution.“We believe the appearance of a desire line is not necessarily the marker of a wrong design choice,” they tell me by email. “We believe that a good project implementation should not perfectly retrace desire lines, but rather allow and accommodate a vast range of different behaviours and uses.” Dorato and Lobosco argue that the most important thing to consider when designing public space is “looseness” – our spaces must remain changeable so we can collectively alter our behaviours in unpredictable circumstances, such as the current pandemic. “What we’re learning from this situation is that public and collective spaces need to be as adaptable, loose and resilient as possible,” they say.The academics also have a semi-poetic attitude to desire lines: they argue that our cities still bear the physical traces of history such as wars, earthquakes and floods, and illicit trails leave similar legacies. “In a near future, some of the Covid-19 effects on the urbanscapes will be part of this narrative, reminding us of the importance of human behaviour in shaping the city space.”But if desire paths are so revealing, should we not dedicate more time to chronicling them? So far the phenomenon remains mostly documented by amateur photographers and bloggers – the anonymous writer “the gentle author” has shared illicit trails on his popular blog, Spitalfields Life, arguing that “each desire path tells a story. While our modern monolith, Google, ignores desire paths with its Maps service, others are attempting more official documentation. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an international, crowd-sourced project to create a free map of the world – since 2004, thousands of volunteers have input data about roads, railways, rivers and yes, desire paths.According to OSM, most of the UK’s desire paths are in Nottingham and Leeds. It’s unclear if this is because there are actually more desire paths in these areas, or if these locations are simply home to avid OSM users. Kazazi puts me in touch with a Nottingham man who has documented a large number of desire paths, but unfortunately he declines to explain his motivations.Still, other people have easy explanations: they are paid to notice desire paths. Tom Ritzer is a landcare director at the University of Minnesota who anticipates and monitors what he calls “cow paths” as part of his job. Around 2012, a new physics and nanotechnology building was constructed at the university, and a new desire path quickly emerged on a slope between the building and the main road. “It was pretty unsightly and the soil was washing away,” Ritzer explains, so around 2015, his team paved the path with decomposed granite (a more stable form of gravel good for heavily used paths).Yet Ritzer’s paved path isn’t a direct copy of the desire path made by students’ feet. While planning the path, Ritzer added a small curve to comply with local accessibility laws that determine how steep a sloped path can be. But Ritzer also couldn’t make the curve too large for fear of students creating an extra desire path as they cut corners. “I think it turned out pretty well,” he laugh. “It does accommodate a lot of foot traffic and it’s a nice way to experience that particular part of the landscape.”Closer to home we’ve seen similar initiatives. Councillor Damian White of Havering says a Tarmac path and crossing was paved on a grassy verge in his London borough between 2017 and 2019 for “safety reasons”. “The damage to the public green is thought to have been created by increased footfall as a cut-through from the shops and bus stops,” he explains, adding that the uneven surface was unsafe and he was “very pleased” when the official path was paved. “It has now improved the look of the area and better reflects what our residents expect.”But not every desire path can be paved. Ritzer has been a landscape architect for 30 years and says there’s “no middle ground” between choosing to accommodate foot traffic or choosing to prevent it. He has used granite to pave over desire lines and planted bushes or constructed barriers to stop would-be desire paths in their tracks. “It’s driven by safety, or sometimes we’re trying to protect a particular tree and we don’t want compaction around the roots,” he explains. “Other times it’s just aesthetic.” In rare circumstances, Ritzer has simply left dirt paths alone – he says one that runs through a wooded area on campus is “charming” and a “nice experience” for students.When it comes to desire paths, it’s apparent that we can’t always get what we want. Some paths will always remain illicit, while others demonstrate the power we have to change our own environments for the collective good. “We are living through a moment where we’re all being asked to consider where we go, who we go near, what our distance is,” says Mayhew, the Northampton man who discovered three new paths in his local park. “I think desire paths are very beautiful, poetic marks of democracy.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb778bbbfee8c30797a1808c8d5eb5c3ceb468bb/0_85_6007_3597/master/6007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60129166a78777315b32e8425b47636","title":"phoebe bridgers aged 12 or 13 i was just like im the next bob dylan","story":"As she prepares to release a second album, the Californian indie rocker reflects on provocative lyrics, recent collaborations and what she now thinks of Ryan AdamsYou are a talented young musician whose career has taken off in the past couple of years. Artists you greatly admire want to collaborate with you, declaring themselves “floored” by your music, and excitable comparisons are made to the work of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Now you’re touring the world, jetting off to faraway places that you could only dream about while growing up in west-coast suburbia. But when you get there – to Japan, say – you find yourself strangely unmoved by your surroundings. Worse, you end up longing for the everyday comforts you’ve left behind. You would rather skip the visit to the temple or the ride on the bullet train with your bandmates and sneak home.This is the predicament in which Phoebe Bridgers finds herself on her new album, Punisher, a collection of beautifully wrought songs that cast a razor-sharp eye on the absurdities of modern life. In Bridgers’s lyrical universe, dreams that appear beguiling from a distance are liable to fall flat in the space of a chorus. “I wanted to see the world,” she sings rousingly on Kyoto. “Then I flew over the ocean And I changed my mind.”This was meant to be a particularly busy time for Bridgers, whose album, her second, comes out on Friday. “Before all this started,” she says, “my publicist told me I didn’t have one day off for three months.” When we speak, Bridgers should be somewhere in the American heartlands on tour with the 1975, on whose new album she features. She looks it up on her calendar. “We’re supposed to be between Colorado and Omaha. Damn it!”But maybe it’s about time she had a rest. Three years ago, Bridgers released her debut album, Stranger in the Alps, to admiring reviews. The NME called it “luscious but deeply sad”, while Pitchfork declared the single Motion Sickness, written after Bridgers’s separation from disgraced rocker Ryan Adams (more on him later), “one of the year’s most exquisite breakup anthems”.Taking three years to deliver a follow-up may seem pretty laidback, until you consider that Bridgers has released two more records in the interim: an EP with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus as Boygenius and the album Better Oblivion Community Center with Conor Oberst, who described her easy falsetto as “an old friend you didn’t know you had”.All three records testify to Bridgers’s flair as a songwriter, spiking her emo-tinged folk-rock with Technicolor vignettes about murder, doomed love and lolling around in low-lit bedrooms. Her songs capture the moods and rhythms of a generation hardwired to social media – Bridgers is a wry, surreal presence on Twitter – that views the world and their future in it with a mix of humour, detachment and dread.Her writing gets better still on the new album, from the eerily dreamlike opener Garden Song, with its vision of a childhood home going up in flames, “except the notches in the doorframe”, to the stormbound climax of I Know the End, where impending apocalypse is soundtracked by “some America First rap country song”. (She’s no fan of Trump: “Our president,” she says, “is posing as anti-authority but he’s not, he’s a fucking dictator.”)Bridgers’s lyrics are often described as dark and brooding, but they can be funny too, often jarringly so. (“I hate your mom,” she announces, without warning, to a love interest on I See You). The jarring effect is important, she says, because she writes best when testing limits. “It’s very easy to write kind of just whatever lyrics,” she says, “but all my favourite lyrics are just like truthful, weird shit that you have to dare yourself into actually writing down.”Right now, with no one else around to speak weird truths to, Bridgers finds that she is becoming her own target. “A punisher,” she says, referring to the album title, “is someone who doesn’t know when to stop talking. And I was thinking the other day: this is my house of punishment. I am stuck here with my intrusive thoughts … It’s forcing me to deal with a lot of shit.”Bridgers found an outlet for her creative energies early on – “too early”, she says. Growing up in Pasadena, just inland from LA, with music a constant presence at home, she found it easy to imagine future stardom. “I felt like I had a God-given gift,” she laughs. “Aged 12 or 13 I was just like, ‘Wow, I’m the next Bob Dylan.’”Her parents were supportive of her ambitions and at 13 Bridgers was accepted at a high school that specialised in performing arts. She started gigging soon afterwards and in 2014 was offered a part in an iPhone ad. Bridgers accepted, viewing this and subsequent commercial work, for brands such as Taco Bell, as a way to bankroll her musical ambitions or, as she puts it now: “Work for five days a year and make your own trust fund.”Later that year, after turning 20, she came to the attention of the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, who was nearly twice her age. Inviting Bridgers to perform at his studio, he fed her compliments and talked about releasing her songs on his label. They started dating but soon afterwards Adams “turned obsessive and emotionally abusive”, as Bridgers put it in a 2019 New York Times exposé. The article, which drew on testimony from several women, alleged that Adams had a history of promising to help female artists with their career while pursuing them for sex, then withdrawing offers of support if they spurned him and in some cases subjecting them to emotional and verbal abuse. (Adams has denied the accusations.)When she met Adams for the first time, she tells me, “I thought he was really cool”. “In retrospect, hearing about everybody else’s experience, it put mine really starkly in contrast. And I remember feeling sad and hurt and sick about all of it, but I didn’t really have the words to describe it until later, when I started connecting with everybody else and our timelines matched up so creepily… But no, I was totally enamoured with him and was like, ‘Oh, shit, that’s like my adult life starting.’ He was so championing me. He was wanting to record all the time. And I never really had that before.”When Bridgers broke off the relationship, Adams rowed back on his promises of support, though he did eventually release three songs on his Pax-Am label. Unlike some of the other women who later spoke out against Adams, Bridgers was able to keep her career on track – Motion Sickness, which took aim at their relationship, has had nearly 35m plays on Spotify – but the experience left its mark. When I ask Bridgers whether she thinks there are many other untold stories like that in the music industry, she says: “I know for a fact there are.”Her recent collaborations have been far more positive. Working with Baker, Dacus and Oberst were “fucking incredible experiences – like summer camp as an adult”, she says. “It helped me relax my weird, tight little world of wanting to control everything. Being able to say, ‘What do you guys think about this?’ has totally changed the way I write and for the better. I used to think of it as way more solitary. And now I’ve learned how to bring people into it.”How would she describe her lifestyle as a musician, pre-pandemic? If there was a barometer for rock’n’roll excess, would she register high on it? She splutters. “No, very low! Boygenius and I were all in our pyjamas by 11.45pm after getting off stage at 11.30.” Getting up at 8am to practise yoga was a higher priority. “Very, very square,” she says.So perhaps being stuck at home is not a major disruption? “I’m being more domestic than I’ve ever been,” she says. “I learned how to clean for the first time. I just folded in all my boxes and recycled them and it was orgasmic.” She also found time to appear on Jimmy Kimmel (performing Kyoto from her bath with a toy microphone) and interview the Normal People actor Paul Mescal on Instagram.The world may be in a perilous state and Bridgers has no idea when she’ll next step on to a tour bus, let alone leave her apartment, but, she says, only half-joking: “I think there are major gaps in my adulthood that I’m filling right now.”Punisher is out on Dead Oceans on 19 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e224368694f02db1d63ef736934da6690cbd92/0_18_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f5ed3327e1d5fc7d19f157fa1bbecf","title":"how the disappearance of madeleine mccann became a national obsession podcast","story":"The disappearance of a three -year-old British girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 quickly became a global news story as the hunt for her grew ever more extensive.

But with economic challenges forecast after the pandemic, will the government end decades of orthodoxy and follow Europe by investing state funds into struggling sectors?There are no admiring visitors. JLR’s Castle Bromwich plant, like the rest of British industry, shut down at the end of March. Nearly three months later, the showroom is still closed beyond it, the vast battleship-grey production blocks, which operate at the cutting edge of Britain’s green technology revolution, are silent. Of the company’s 38,000-strong British workforce, based primarily in the Midlands but also in Merseyside, 20,000 employees have been furloughed. Some plants have reopened with social distancing restrictions, but last week it was confirmed that Castle Bromwich will stay shuttered until at least 10 August.No one knows if and when production will properly resume, or when demand, which has fallen through the floor, will pick up. Other Midlands manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce in Derby, have already shed thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, JLR is accumulating debt at such a rate that it is seeking state aid worth at least £1bn from the Treasury.That might seem a great deal of money for the British government to hand a company which is a subsidiary of the Indian giant Tata Motors. On the other hand, as Des Quinn, a Midlands-based manufacturing specialist for the Unite union, points out: “It’s going to cost companies like this billions to invest in green and other future technologies. That’s going to be impossible in the context of Covid. Government is going to need to subsidise. Either it helps to finance business to get ahead in the green race … or it ends up paying people to be unemployed.”Jaguar Land Rover’s future will be just one high-profile test case as Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempt to navigate their way through the economic wreckage left by the Covid-19 pandemic. The notion that the state should get its hands dirty in pursuing a proactive industrial policy – “picking winners” as it is sometimes disparagingly described – has been deeply unfashionable in Britain since Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp. But these are extraordinary times Whitehall assumptions which have dominated policy for 40 years are beginning to look threadbare and dated.Amid post-pandemic concerns over mountains of debt, economic security, the fragility of extended supply-chains and the geopolitical rise of China, the global economy appears to be entering a more cautious era. As societies accord a new priority to resilience against future shocks, the interventionist state, planning on their behalf, is making a comeback.In post-lockdown Britain, the political battle over what that might mean is just about to begin. The chancellor has already authorised the biggest programme of government subsidies seen in peacetime. On one estimate, almost £90bn worth of taxpayer money has been handed to businesses and employees through the job-retention scheme and various loan packages. Public borrowing, as a result, is at a record high. But eye-wateringly expensive as they were, these measures were conceived as a way of merely keeping businesses afloat during lockdown. The real test, as businesses reopen in a landscape transformed beyond recognition, is yet to come.Reacting to the latest cascade of dire statistics, the prime minister referred to the heavy cost of lockdown on an economy that has long been dominated by services. But in unprecedented times, can Britain continue to neglect what’s left of a manufacturing base that still plays a vital role in regions such as the Midlands?Last month, details emerged of a Treasury plan to provide sustained state support for strategically key companies hit by the pandemic, whose collapse would “disproportionately harm the economy”. “Project Birch” could see the government extending long-term loans or taking equity in some of the biggest names in British business. As well as JLR, there has also been speculation that Virgin Atlantic, Rolls-Royce and Tata Steel may become beneficiaries of state intervention.For a Tory chancellor, such a move would certainly be bold. But according to Will Tanner, a former adviser to Theresa May and director of the centre-right Onward thinktank: “This government is more willing to consider taking a strategic role in industry than has been the case for many years.”Tanner points to the unsuccessful attempt to prop up Flybe, the regional airline that eventually collapsed at the beginning of March. “The action to support Flybe was overwhelmed by coronavirus,” he says. “But at the time it was significant. It showed a recognition of the value of the company in terms of regional connectivity. The truth is that a government will always be picking winners. It will always be deciding, according to some kind of method. You can’t avoid the political dimension. Taking decisions according to some notion of pure economic value was one reason for the levels of regional disparity that have emerged in our economy.”Nevertheless, Tanner does not believe that a Sunak-led programme of part-nationalisation is coming any time soon. “The first preference would be for a loan rather than taking equity in businesses. Government has not actually got a good track record at managing large shareholders and representing the interests of taxpayers.”Unsurprisingly, in Labour ranks, there is a desire for more ambition and daring. One of Sunak’s predecessors, Alistair Darling, recently told the Financial Times: “Taking equity might be a good thing for the taxpayer to do. If you’re lending money, say to an airline, it’s only right the taxpayer gets its fair share of the success at the end.”The shadow business secretary and former Labour leader, Ed Miliband, believes Project Birch could provide a crucial opportunity to act on lessons already learned during the Covid-19 crisis. “Government must do everything it can to help rescue companies in distress, but the idea that it should just be a kind of ambulance service and then get out of the way is very short-sighted.“Only in this country are we so blind to the advantages of a strategic industrial policy, in which the public and private sector collaborate together for the greater good. This crisis has shown us the mutual dependency of the public and the private. Industry agreed to shut down to protect public health. The state guaranteed to support industry while it did so. As we emerge, that relationship should continue to be fundamental to the recovery.”Going back to a hands-off approach would, Miliband says, be to return to a discredited way of doing economics. As in so many other dimensions, the coronavirus crisis has brutally exposed faultlines and weaknesses which were already there. “We know that we had big economic problems when it came to productivity levels, inequality and job insecurity. We know that the manufacturing sector suffered from a financial system that didn’t properly support it and that the economy was unbalanced, in favour of London and the south-east. Returning to the status quo isn’t what’s needed. We will only build the new economy we need with the state playing an active strategic role.”In Britain’s battered car industry, the need for strategic vision and a steady nerve has never been more pressing. The diesel crisis, Brexit and now the Covid shutdown have left an industry on its knees. “It’s been a perfect storm,” says David Bailey, professor of business economics at the Birmingham Business School. “Covid is probably the biggest challenge the car industry has ever had. Covid plus a no-deal Brexit – and the tariffs that would bring – would be a catastrophe. And in the next 10-15 years, as a result of green targets and automation, there are probably going to be more dramatic changes in the industry than happened over the past 100.”Bailey would be in favour of the state taking a stake in Jaguar Land Rover: “It would be good to have the government in there as a shareholder, providing finance, helping set long-term directions and keeping business in the UK. And it would lead to better communication and understanding about what the industry needs. For example, Britain has fallen badly behind in the battery manufacturing capacity that we need to compete with Germany and France in the electric-vehicle market.”What is required, he suggests, is a change of cultural mindset and a belated abandonment of prejudices going back to the 1970s and 1980s.“There is a future for manufacturing in western economies but here in Britain we developed a cultural problem over it. At the high point of globalisation the assumption became that it would just go elsewhere. It’s worth noting that the French government is more active in Renault and Peugeot than our government is. Or look at Lower Saxony in Germany, which has a stake in Volkswagen.”Last month, local Conservative politicians, including Birmingham’s mayor, Andy Street, wrote to the business secretary, Alok Sharma. Their message was stark: post-Covid economic recovery in the region depended on “bold and decisive” support for key businesses such as JLR.“If the Conservatives are serious about holding on to the red wall seats they won,” says Bailey, “having a decent industrial policy would be one way to go about it.”In the British political imagination, the phrase “picking winners” still conjures up sepia images of the beleaguered 1970s governments of Edward Heath and Harold Wilson, sunk by the oil crisis and undone by unruly unions. Over past decades, this folk memory has been offered as a cautionary tale to politicians tempted to dabble in matters best left to the market.But the legend never told the full story of a turbulent period. If British Leyland, which then included Jaguar and Land Rover among its brands, had not been nationalised in 1975, it is doubtful whether a car industry would have survived in the United Kingdom. As the consequences of the oil shock buffeted western societies, the government acted as a necessary bulwark in dangerous times. Almost half a century later, in the context of a pandemic, economic chaos and an ongoing climate emergency, it may be time for the state to go back to the future.BritainChancellor Rishi Sunak has pushed back an emergency budget to the autumn, but is expected to give an economic update in July which could include interim measures to try to kickstart the economy. It is expected that the government will announce tax cuts, new spending on infrastructure and new investment green technology. Under the Project Birch scheme, the government will offer state support to key firms whose failure would have a “disproportionate” impact on the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dd328f178f8705a5bdd432aae38674fc1ace80f/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=968e6043ff64b76ca34598270c17964a","title":"poll uk government losing public approval over handling of virus","story":"A new low of just three in 10 people support Covid-19 measures, says Opinium surveyLess than a third of the public now approve of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.The poll found that approval of the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is down four points to a new low.

Thanks in advance!Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended the Government’s “reasonable and measured” approach to schools reopening, after the Children’s Commissioner for England said that it was undermining children’s right to an educationDuring a round of broadcast interviews this morning, Sunak said that every day children were away from school was a “tragedy” but insisted the Government had acted correctly. With most pupils likely to stay home until September, Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield told the Observer that “very dangerous” threat to the right to guaranteed education and that next year’s academic year could be seriously impacted. You can read more from my colleagues Michael Savage and Liz Lightfoot here:Ministers are set to mount a new push this week to get more primary school children back school ahead of the summer break.Currently, primary schools in England are opening to pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, but ministers will reaffirm that schools can host children from other year groups - as long as they have the resources and space to do so safely. This means limiting class sizes to 15 and introducing protective measures such as regular hand washing to reduce the likelihood of coronavirus spreading.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has said it will monitor any moves by the UK to introduce a “light touch” approach to goods entering the country from the EU after the Brexit transition period. It comes after the the UK Government said on Friday that it was exploring whether to adopt fewer checks on imports from the EU for around six months.Roberto Azevedo, director-general of the WTO, said that such a move is “not a no-go by definition”, but that the UK would have to follow strict rules.He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “You have transitional periods in most of these trade deals. So, you may have a period where that ‘light touch’ may be part of the transitional agreement and other members of the WTO may take that as something acceptable.It may, however, be done in a way that challenges the rules of the WTO a little bit more and then members, I think, will be looking very carefully.”He also said he believes there is a “pretty good chance” of the UK and EU finding a deal before the end of the transition period.A couple who were arrested when armed police stormed their home and held them for 36 hours over the flying of drones at Gatwick Airport will receive £200,000 in compensation and an apology from police.

Returning briefly to Rishi Sunak’s interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, the chancellor said the economy was taking a “enormous hit” from coronavirus but insisted that the government had protected millions of jobs through the furlough scheme.Sunak said he hoped the opening of non-essential shops in England from Monday, coupled with the ability for companies to take on workers part-time next month, would help “drive the recovery” before the furlough scheme ends in October.Asked about research by the Institute for Employment Studies, which suggests that 3 million people are currently unemployed – the highest since the 1980s – and that by Autumn the level of unemployment would be the highest in UK history, Sunak said there would be “hardship ahead” and that the government was dealing with an unprecedented situation and that the virus would have “an enormous cost”.“What I do know is the situation would be a lot worse if we hadn’t acted in the way we did,” he added.Sunak said it was important people had the confidence to go shopping because the government had “made enormous progress” in tackling the virus, and that shops would have safety measures in place.On the 14-day quarantine of arrivals to Britain, Sunak said it would keep it under review and that it was “looking at all options,” including opening up travel corridors with other countries. He did not demur from the suggestion that the quarantine would be relaxed.Sunak said a second spike in infections would be “very damaging” and that all countries were “feeling our way through” the virus. He added:Until there’s a cure, a vaccine, everything we do carries some degree of risk. I think everybody acknowledges that. Our job is to execute the plan we put in place, which is to protect people, make sure the NHS isn’t overwhelmed and that is what thus far we’ve been able to achieve.Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer will today join people across the country in marking the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.A video message from the prime minister will be shown at a virtual service being hosted by the Bishop of Kensington this morning. This evening, Downing Street will be illuminated to commemorate those who lost their lives.Several other landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster, Trafalgar Square fountains and Grenfell Tower have also been lit up this weekend, while digital screens at the site of the tower carry messages from local stakeholder groups.“We can all remember where we were three years ago today when we saw this tragedy unfolding on our screens and across the London skyline,” Johnson recalls in his message.Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said he would be “relentless” in ensuring those responsible for the disaster are held to account:David Lammy, the Labour MP, has released this powerful interview with Channel 4 News in which he says that a crucial part of Britain’s safety net for vulnerable people - safe housing – is “falling apart around our eyes”:Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said a decision on whether to ease the two-metre rule in England will be for ministers rather than the government’s scientific advisers.Sunak said the public would take confidence from the fact ministers were being advised by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty.Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance throughout all of this have provided advice to ministers. Ultimately it is for ministers. We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions. I think that people are comforted and have confidence in those decisions if they know that we are taking advice from our scientists.Pippa Crerar, the Daily Mirror’s political editor, points out that taking such a decision without the express backing of Vallance and Whitty would be even trickier if the pair are “on resignation watch,” as the Sunday Times reports today.Labour’s shadow justice secretary David Lammy has accused the government of having “buried” recommendations from a report by Public Health England looking at the disproportionate toll Covid-19 has had on people from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background.Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Lammy said: It’s horrifying that at the moment across this country it’s hard to be black or Asian and not know someone, or someone who knows someone, who has died. I’ve lost an uncle. I’ve lost a classmate who died at 45 due to this terrible virus.The point is it’s a scandal if one week Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock say ‘Black Lives Matter’ and then we find out today that they buried part of the review that had the recommendations in it to do something about it.He added: “Get on it with it because people are dying every day and you said ‘Black Lives Matter’. It’s no wonder why people are upset.”A 28-year-old man has been arrested in Essex on suspicion of outraging public decency after a man was photographed urinating next to the memorial dedicated to PC Keith Palmer, the politan Police has said.The man is currently in custody in Essex after presenting himself at a police station, the force said.Speaking yesterday in response to an image circulating on social media, Commander Bas Javid said: “We are aware of a disgusting and abhorrent image circulating on social media of a man appearing to urinate on a memorial to PC Palmer. “I feel for PC Palmer’s family, friends and colleagues. We have immediately launched an investigation, and will gather all the evidence available to us and take appropriate action.”Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has suggested he is very much in favour of reducing the two-metre social distancing rule. Unsurprising, perhaps, for the minister responsible for the economy but important nonetheless that he has said it.On Sky News, Sunak said “I very much understand the positive impact it will have” on the economy but “at the same time we must make sure it’s safe to do so”.He suggested that reducing the rule could be the “difference between three quarters and a third of pubs opening, for example” – an example that will almost certainly win the backing of some newspapers. Sunak also said Norway and Denmark had recently reduced their social distancing guide from two metres.He welcome that Boris Johnson was overseeing a “comprehensive review” of the policy, which Sunak said would consider evidence from economists as well as scientists “so we can look at it in the round”.The chancellor Rishi Sunak has described the clashes between police and protestors in London yesterday as “shocking and disgusting” but said the UK had made “enormous progress” on issues of race.Appearing on Sophy Ridge’s programme on Sky News, Sunak confirmed that the justice secretary Robert Buckland would meet Conservative MPs this week to discuss strict new measures against those who vandalise a war memorial, including potential 10-year jail terms.“There will always be a small minority who maintain prejudice and indeed are racist but that’s not the description that I would make of our country,” he said, adding that things have changed “enormously for the better”.Labour’s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has said the party would potentially support proposals to jail for 10 years anyone who desecrates a war memorial. The Sunday  reports that ministers are considering plans to make it easier to prosecute those who vandalise historic monuments, including with jail terms of up to a decade.Speaking on the Sky News Sophy Ridge programme, Thomas-Symonds said he was “extremely disturbed” by the “completely unacceptable” scenes of violence on the streets following protests on Saturday.A variety of stories make the front pages of Sunday’s newspapers, with some focusing on the violent scenes in London yesterday and others on coronavirus.The Observer leads with a warning from England’s children’s commissioner Anne Longfield that there was a “very dangerous” threat to the historic right to education for children after the government said most schools would not reopen until September at the earliest.The Sunday Times reports that plans to allow people to change their legal gender by self-identifying as a different sex have been scrapped.The Mail on Sunday says Boris Johnson has paved the way for the two-metre social distancing rule to be scrapped by “taking personal control of the decision to axe it”. It says the prime minister has commissioned a “comprehensive No 10 review” of the policy.The Sunday Mirror leads with a simple one-word headline: “Shameful” as it depicts the violent demonstrations by far-right activists in London.The Independent on Sunday reports on Brexit (remember that?) and a poll suggesting that most Britons would support an extension to the transition period for leaving the European Union due to Covid-19.The Sunday  says ministers are considering proposals to jail for 10 years anyone who desecrates a war memorial.And finally... the Daily Star Sunday reports on “a big flap” in the Royal household after “eight of the Queen’s racing pigeons died in quarantine”. The paper says the poor pigeons died in crates after being flown to South African to take part in a race. A “Palace coo” is underway, it says.Good morning and welcome to the UK liveblog.There is widespread condemnation of the violent protest in central London yesterday, which saw thousands of demonstrators – including far-right activists – descend on the capital prompting clashes with the police.As of 9pm on Saturday, the politan police said it had made more than 100 arrests at the protest which Boris Johnson said had descended into “racist thuggery”. The clashes with police and journalists came after thousands of white nationalists poured into London to “protect the monuments,” after graffiti on the statue of Winston Churchill and the Cenotaph in London, and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, during Black Lives Matter protests last weekend.Elsewhere today, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is touring the TV studios ahead of the reopening of non-essential shops in England on Monday as the government attempts to reboot the economy.It’s also emerged that the prime minister has ordered an official review of the two-metre social distancing rule, potentially providing a further boost for business. However, any move to one metre is likely to split the government’s scientific advisors who have repeatedly expressed caution about reducing the rule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5398e1f4b0ae1d75c84ef43e55d137ea4044bca/0_380_5012_3005/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143d4b3646d7f07a390998959a18ab0e","title":"locking down leopoldstadt what happened when the west end closed overnight","story":"Tom Stoppard’s new play was enjoying a sold-out run when venues closed. Its producer, Sonia Friedman, recalls how the crisis unfoldedTom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt was just beginning its eighth sold-out week at Wyndham’s theatre in London’s West End when the order came through that it was shutting down. Greeted as a late-period masterpiece – and possibly the final play – of a leading playwright who had waited until his 80s to investigate his Jewish background, it was a huge production to match the scale of the history it charted, following a prosperous Viennese family from 1899 to 1955, with opening and closing tableaux that revealed just how annihilating the intervening years had been.\u0026nbspThough it was not intended to offer a topical reflection on the antisemitism that has been tearing the left apart in the UK over the past few years, its debates about the limits of assimilation hit a nerve, and audiences poured in. “I thought this was the tail end of interest in the Holocaust, but as a matter of fact it had become a sort of hotspot. I didn’t write about more recent events, but it was part of the consciousness that the audience brought to the play,” reflects Stoppard.\u0026nbspThis consciousness that, for all that it was set in the past, the play was telling an important and topical story, was passionately shared by the 43-strong cast, more than two-thirds of whom were themselves Jewish, who were determined to carry on for as long as they could as the closure of public spaces swept across the globe. Though the West End was emptying, Leopoldstadt’s audiences kept turning up – increasing numbers of them in face masks. When the decision to shut down was finally taken, the company went off to a local pub to await further instructions, recalls producer Sonia Friedman, “and all we could say to them was: ‘You have to go home’”.If you want to understand just how devastating the Covid-19 crisis has been to the world of entertainment, you need look no further than the week that Friedman will never forget. On the afternoon of Wednesday 11 March, her production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was midway through a performance at San Francisco’s Curran theatre when the city’s mayor announced a ban on all events involving more than 1,000 people. “For better or worse we made the decision to keep going but shut down in the evening after part two. There had been a state of emergency in California from early March and we’d been watching sales haemorrhage,” says the producer, whose 11 productions running around the world at the time included five of the hit JK Rowling play – in Germany, Australia, the US and London.\u0026nbspThe following afternoon New York closed all its Broadway theatres, taking down a further three of Friedman’s shows. On Friday, the German production of Harry Potter was shut down on the final day of previews in Hamburg. On Sunday, Melbourne theatres closed, taking the Australian production with it, and on Monday 16 March – “by this point in acute crisis mode” – Friedman took the preemptive step of heeding Boris Johnson’s “advice” that all UK entertainment outlets should close, and shut down her five remaining productions.Nearly three months on, the shock has transformed into the passionate determination that has made Friedman one of the world’s most successful theatre producers. She abandoned her London home before official lockdown to stay with her writer partner, Joe Murphy, and their two dogs in a Hampshire cottage rented to them by Tom Stoppard’s wife, Sabrina Guinness. For the first eight or nine weeks, given the number of shows she had suspended and “the absolute tumult of chaos and uncertainty” it had created in so many time zones, Friedman only managed three or four hours sleep a night. “I’ve been trying to do what I can to save my industry and my people, talking constantly with my staff, theatre owners, producers and investors, but no one has any answers.”The figures are startling: the UK has some 1,300 theatres around the country employing some 290,000 workers, from actors to administrators, stage technicians to front-of-house staff. A paper sent to the DCMS last month by the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre points out that in 2018, their members sold tickets worth £1.28bn. The theatre’s value to the London economy, where nearly half of all UK performances take place and tourists make up a quarter of audiences, is estimated to be £5bn a year. And Friedman’s portfolio of closed shows is testament to the export value of this dynamic British industry.Theatre is such a people-centred industry that its resumption poses particular problems, and return plans will have to be carefully tailored to the profile of each show. The first of Friedman’s shows to reopen will probably be Harry Potter in Australia, where measures to contain the pandemic have been considerably more successful than in Europe and the US. “We’re aiming for September, and I think it’ll be a test case for the world,” says the producer.\u0026nbspSince audiences for Leopoldstadt are generally older than those for other West End shows such as Harry Potter or The Book of Mormon, it will probably make a later return – but so long as the company still wants to do it, and the audience still wants to see it, return it will, she promises. And from London, all being well, it will go on to New York.\u0026nbspKeeping faith with a vision for a post-Covid world is hard but crucial, Friedman insists. While her days are spent lobbying and problem-solving with the half of her 40-strong core staff who have not been furloughed, the hours between 11pm and 2 or 3am are devoted to “what I call my future: every day I do something positive to imagine there’s something on the other side of this, other than resuming the shows at hand.”The potential of the crisis as a source of future themes and plotlines is not lost on her. “We exist in a world of stories in our theatre and this story isn’t credible yet we’re living it,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I keep telling people, ‘this is history, guys’, it’s going to be discussed for centuries. We’re dealing with something so monumentally complex that the biggest brains in the world are only just beginning to come to terms with what needs to be done.”\u0026nbspAs a theatre producer it pays to be Teflon-coated. “I’ve always been quite good in a crisis,” she says, “I’m not going to give up until I’m done, and if I’m done the rest of the industry is going to be done too, because until then I’m sure as hell going to be still standing.” Meanwhile the venerable Wyndham’s theatre slumbers on, its grand Viennese apartment set swathed in ghostly plastic sheeting, waiting for the great awakening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f34dc2c38c0b88044a27e657902ee77a4d73d38e/0_36_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8011fe7bdd92049c3151a4f632b2e4","title":"wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares jenny eclair on bladder weakness","story":"The author and comedian lets loose on a wee problem many women are still too shy to talk about: accidental leakageThere are many reasons why you might wet yourself, but the best is laughter. I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly – seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we’d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity “school assembly” laughter, and when I’m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I’m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn’t a female comic who hasn’t gone through motherhood without making an “every time I cough, I wet my pants” stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids’ trampoline: “Thirty seconds later, I’d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,” I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It’s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life – many of us haven’t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, “just in case”.As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina’s (I’ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone’s laps to get to the ladies.For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that “when one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you’ve finished, as you inevitably haven’t, there’s usually a few drops more”. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then “give your lettuce a good shake” as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don’t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what? Unless you’re wearing a gusset of galvanised steel, there’s no reason why anyone should know.Of course in the olden days women would rather die of shame than talk to anyone about bladder weakness, but one of the great things about being a 21st-century woman is that we know this kind of thing is common.So remember girls, incontinence is not a moral weakness, it’s not laziness, it’s a fact of life for millions, so whatever you do, keep laughing and don’t let a little bit of wee spoil your fun.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The city had largely returned to normal life, with restaurants and shops opening and daily rush-hour traffic resuming.As it became clear there were dozens of cases, mostly linked to the Xinfadi food market, there was an abrupt reversal. Southern Fengtai district, where the market is located, has more than 2 million residents, and 11 residential compounds and several schools near the market have been closed.Movement restrictions were also brought back across the capital, sports events were suspended, tourism from other parts of the country barred and plans to reopen primary schools put on hold.The new infections sparked a panic about salmon, which was pulled from supermarkets around the country after cutting boards used to prepare imported salmon were among surfaces that tested positive for the virus. Fish cannot be infected by coronavirus.Six new domestic infections were reported on Saturday, three workers at the Xinfadi market, two people who had visited and a work colleague of one of the visitors.Officials have quarantined 139 close contacts of people infected. The marketis closed and surrounded by military and police on 24-hour watch. More than 10,000 people who work there will now be tested.“In accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,” said Chu Junwei, a district official. The district is in a “wartime emergency mode”, he said.Underlining government concerns, volunteers were going door to door in distant parts of the city on Saturday asking if anyone had visited the Xinfadi market recently. There will be mass testing of anyone who has been there since the end of May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fffd794f2095b5d3551630c533d5c1956431fab/0_182_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88957b01517b55676c902103b65886d0","title":"brazil coronavirus spanish flu","story":"A century after the 1918 pandemic, South America’s largest country has passed Britain to claim the world’s second-highest death tollAs a child growing up in 1940s São Paulo, Drauzio Varella remembers his grandmother’s tales of how the Spanish flu ravaged the blue-collar immigrant community they called home.“So many people died that families would leave people outside on the pavements, and early each morning the carts would come by to collect them and take them off to burial in mass graves,” remembered Varella, who would go on to become Brazil’s best-known doctor.More than a century after the 1918 calamity, South America’s largest country is again being shaken by a devastating pandemic, and Varella is in disbelief.“Nobody thought this could happen. Perhaps they imagined it theoretically – that some kind of virus might come along,” said the 77-year-old oncologist, author and broadcaster. “But even when this virus did show up, we didn’t think it would cause a tragedy of such proportions.”The precise magnitude of Brazil’s Covid-19 tragedy remains unclear – but the story told by official statistics grows more wretched by the day.On Friday, Brazil overtook Britain as the country with the world’s second-highest death toll: 41,901 deaths since the first fatality was confirmed in São Paulo on 17 March.A University of Washington projection indicated another 100,000 Brazilians could die before August, possibly placing Brazil ahead of the US as the country with the most deaths.As the catastrophe deepens there is growing anger at the conduct of president Jair Bolsonaro, whose jumbled and dysfunctional handling of a pandemic he has called a “fantasy” has made Boris Johnson’s widely panned response look sober and efficient.“This is the worst public health crisis\u0026nbspwe’ve faced – and it has come at a time when we have the worst government in the world,” said Daniel Dourado, a public health expert and lawyer from the University of São Paulo who believes thousands of lives could have been saved by a swifter and less erratic response. “The country is adrift.”There are uncanny and painful parallels between the impact of the Spanish flu – which historians say killed between 35,000 and 100,000 Brazilians – and the harm coronavirus is now inflicting.Then, too, authorities tried to hide the true scale of the disaster – just as Bolsonaro’s health ministry has been accused of doing – until, like now, the determination of Brazilian journalists made that impossible.Then, like now, doctors pushed untested and potentially dangerous remedies, just as Brazil’s populist leader has promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine despite limited scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Bertolli Filho said one São Paulo quack was famed for injecting Spanish flu patients with mercury. “He killed lots of people – and yet despite this many believed.”And in 1918, as now, the mysterious malady prompted an explosion of rumour and conspiracy, including claims German submarines had secretly spread the infirmity along the Brazilian coast. (In fact, it arrived on an English merchant ship called the Demerara).But perhaps no parallel is more cruel than the way in which both catastrophes obliterated the idea pandemics chose victims indiscriminately.Bertolli Filho said the 1919 death of Brazil’s president-elect, Rodrigues Alves, from the Spanish flu was widely cited as proof epidemics were equal opportunity.In fact, cemetery records showed most of São Paulo’s 5,000 dead hailed from working class, industrial districts such as Mooca, Ipiranga, and Brás, where Varella’s grandmother watched the corpse collectors at work. Today, the areas suffering most are blue collar communities such as Brasilândia, Freguesia do Ó and Capão Redondo where many do not have the luxury of social distancing or working from home.In Rio, deprived western neighbourhoods such as Campo Grande, Realengo and Bangu have recorded some of the highest death tolls while densely populated favelas like Rocinha and the Complexo da Maré are also being punished.“The truth is, not even a pandemic is truly democratic,” Bertolli Filho said.“Brazil’s situation is so worrying and so unique because if you look at the path the epidemic took – from China, through Asia, and then Europe and on to the US – Brazil was its first encounter with a country suffering from the kind of severe social inequality ours does.”“It will hit other unequal countries, like India and Pakistan, but here was the first – and we are seeing this play out now in a country where 13 or 14 million people live in precarious conditions and great poverty.”The omens were not good. “Ever since the epidemic began, I’ve woken up every day feeling afflicted, thinking about what will happen and how,” Varella said.“The biggest problem we are seeing across Brazil right now is the epidemic spreading through the outskirts of cities and their rundown centres where you have tenements and the homeless live.“Where this will end we have no clue – no clue at all,” he admitted. “Because we are now right in the middle of the dissemination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3613c3d61a7f52ada6f71e99c914dd704465039/0_114_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f00ebc0d14cafef5d898eff2e24a8b4","title":"families reunited and it feels so good loved ones celebrate easing of covid rules","story":"Separated partners and families tell of their joy at sharing hugs for the first time since March under England’s new ‘social bubble’ rulesOn Saturday morning, Lucy Coleman, 36 from Middlesbrough, packed her bags and drove for two-hours to Lincolnshire to see her partner, Phil Bellamy. They’ve always had a long distance relationship and seen each other at weekends and on days off, but lockdown has kept them apart for months.“I was weirdly nervous as I’d hardly seen anyone in ages, but it’s really exciting to be back here, and we’ve just gone back to normal life,” she says. “We’ve had a brew and we’re sat in the garden. He’s done the Iceland shop online, and tonight we’re getting a takeaway from our favourite place.”Reunions such as this are taking place across England this weekend, after Boris Johnson announced that people living alone or as single parents are allowed to combine with another household to form a “support bubble”. The new rules mean they can go inside each other’s houses and stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing.As well as reuniting couples, the change means some grandparents have been able to hug their grandchildren for the first time since March.Josie O’Brien, who lives on her own in Lancashire, is spending the weekend with her daughter Emma Rawlinson, and grandchildren, Harris, four, and Rosa-May, two. “It’s a wonderful feeling. The last few weeks I’ve been saying ‘don’t go near me, keep two metres away’, but they came running up to me and threw their arms around me. Human contact is a basic need, and having that has made such a difference.”Any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, and some say this means choosing between family, friends or sex. “A guy I was seeing wants to be in a bubble with me, but I’ve never liked him that much,” says 34-year-old Louise from Manchester, who lives alone. “But it’s like everyone’s come out of the woodwork. Friends who haven’t been supportive at all are now asking if I want to be in a bubble. It feels way too late.”The new rules are designed to alleviate loneliness among adults living alone. Some say lockdown had begun to take its toll. “I lost my mum on 24 March, and I’ve not had any human contact until this weekend. It’s been very lonely, and my mental health has been affected,” says O’Brien.Her daughter, Emma, says it’s been difficult. “It’s been really tricky to see that the one person struggling the most was probably my mum. The kids missed her a lot, but being back together has been wonderful. We immediately felt like a normal family unit again.”Victoria Benson, chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single-parent families, says that while some will benefit from new rules, the majority still have real worries around how they will care for their children while schools and nurseries stay closed.For Coleman, the pandemic has given her time to reassess what matters to her. She’s been furloughed from her pub job, and although she’s enjoying the break from work, being separated from Bellamy was harder than she expected. “The only thing I’ve been unhappy about this whole time was not seeing him,” she says. “We’re used to being independent but I really missed him, and I won’t take him for granted any more.”Louise says that although it’s nice to have options, the thought of being stuck with one person for the next few months feels strange. “I’ve already spent three months on my own, and I’m sort of over it. If anything, I’d rather see my ex-boyfriend, but neither of us want to get on public transport. I’m considering buying a car,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b70d6498eb0974d53218be10886e29d9cc13e7/0_198_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4dc9121f049e0df888603720bd497b2","title":"global report china reports most cases since april as pandemic gathers pace in latin america","story":"Second wave fears rise in China Chile health minister resigns British citizens evacuated from Colombia European borders reopenChina has reported its highest daily number of new coronavirus cases in months as parts of Beijing remained under lockdown, offering a second-wave warning to the rest of the world as the pandemic rages in South America and global cases approach 7.8 million.The shock resurgence in domestic infections on Sunday has rattled China, where the disease emerged late last year but had largely been tamed through severe restrictions on movement that were later emulated across the globe.It also provides a bleak insight into the difficulties the world will face in conquering Covid-19 – even as countries in Europe prepare to reopen borders at the beginning of the summer holiday season after an encouraging drop in contagion.Of the 57 new cases logged by Chinese authorities, 36 were domestic infections in the capital, where a large wholesale food market at the centre of the outbreak has been closed and nearby housing estates put under lockdown.“People are scared,” a fruit and vegetable trader at another local market in central Beijing told AFP.“The meat sellers have had to close. This disease is really scary,” said the man, adding that there were fewer customers than normal.At least 430,000 people worldwide have died from Covid-19, and the total number of confirmed cases has doubled to 7.78 million in slightly over a month. The disease is now spreading most rapidly in Latin America, where it is threatening healthcare systems and sparking political turmoil.Brazil now has the second-highest number of virus deaths after the US, surpassing Britain’s toll, and the Chilean health minister, Jaime Manalich, resigned on Saturday amid a furore over the country’s true number of fatalities.There have been frequent reports of spats among health ministry officials, and Manalich has been criticised by opposition politicians, mayors, medical experts and social groups for refusing to release more detailed contagion data or apply lockdowns sooner.The sudden reshuffle comes as Chile faces its toughest month in the pandemic so far, with spiralling active cases and death rates. The country now has the highest number of confirmed cases per million people in Latin America, reporting a total so far of 167,355 on Saturday and 3,101 deaths in a population of 19 million.Elsewhere in Latin America, an evacuation flight carrying about 230 British nationals and residents left Colombia’s main airport in Bogota, bound for Heathrow. The plane will return with Colombian evacuees on Sunday.Colombia, which is relaxing some of its lockdown measures, currently has confirmed 46,858 cases of Covid-19, with 1545 deaths. Daily cases are climbing, with 1646 confirmed on Saturday, worrying experts that the worst is about to hit.In Mexico, the health ministry reported 3,494 new confirmed coronavirus infections along with 424 additional fatalities on Saturday, bringing the total in the country to 142,690 cases and 16,872 deaths.While Latin America grapples with its rising tide of cases, many European nations are lifting lockdowns and opening borders.After the European Commission urged a relaxation of restrictions, a number of nations are preparing to reopen borders on Monday – while some like Poland have done so already, with people from other European Union countries allowed to visit.Germany said it would end land border checks on Monday, and France said it would gradually reopen its borders to non-Schengen countries from July. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis travelled to picturesque Santorini island to open his country’s tourism season, while Venice sprang back to life on Saturday as hundreds of tourists flocked to the city for the reopening of the iconic Doge’s Palace.In other developments around the world:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e102c1ada6d54c8bb2857d53b98fe6b6e86a1c/0_363_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7191d470f71e912c8ecf72e998627af","title":"thailand malaysia vietnam how some countries kept covid at bay","story":"As the epidemic took hold in China, many feared for its neighbours. But rapid action and clear messaging have so far contained the virusJust months ago, much of south-east Asia appeared on the brink of a major coronavirus epidemic. The outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan had escalated at the worst possible time, ahead of the lunar new year, when Chinese tourists usually flock to hotels and resorts across the region.Thailand was described as especially vulnerable due to the large number of travellers it had received from Wuhan, and by the end of January it had the second highest number of cases outside of China. As footage circulated online, showing panic in Wuhan hospitals and residents collapsing in the streets, health experts wondered how countries with far weaker health systems would cope.The virus has caused deaths and misery across south-east Asia, particularly in the Philippines, Indonesia and workers’ dorms in Singapore, where officials are struggling to control outbreaks. But elsewhere in the region, the worst fears have so far been mostly avoided.Thailand has recorded 58 deaths, while Malaysia has confirmed 120. Vietnam, which has won praise for its response, has not recorded a single fatality. Public awareness has been key in countries that have had such relative success, said Dale Fisher, professor at the National University of Singapore and chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network at the World Health Organization.Clear messaging, he adds, is essential. “When you have any country with a weak leadership then people get confused. They’re not sure what to do and who to believe, and then you legitimise ignorance,” said Fisher. Experts say that by acting quickly, and by drawing on well-established systems in place following the Sars epidemic in 2002, health departments in many south-east Asian countries have avoided the explosion in community transmission seen elsewhere.In Cambodia, 2,900 health workers were trained and deployed throughout January and February. “They implemented aggressive rapid detection and contact tracing,” said Dr Li Ailan, WHO representative to Cambodia. Meanwhile in Thailand, more than 1 million village health volunteers also monitored communities.In Malaysia, meetings to prepare a response were held as early as December, said Dr Fifa Rahman, who reviewed the country’s handling of the pandemic for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative. Reagents needed for diagnostic tests were ordered early, and plans were made to reorganise hospitals in the event of a large outbreak.As in many other south-east Asian countries, all those diagnosed as Covid-19 positive were hospitalised, even if they were asymptomatic.Countries in the region have not performed mass testing on the same scale as South Korea, but instead focused on high-risk iniduals or targeted mass testing across buildings or neighbourhoods where positive cases were identified. Some question whether low testing rates mean cases have remained hidden. In Cambodia, 17,000 people have been tested so far, with 126 infections detected, most related to foreign travel. There are likely to be undetected infections, but hospitals are not overwhelmed, as in parts of Indonesia. Cambodia has reported no deaths.Mistakes have been made. Cambodia’s authoritarian leader, Hun Sen, caused nervousness by downplaying the virus during the early stages of the outbreak. In Singapore, neglect of migrant workers, who live in overcrowded dormitories, caused the vast majority of its 40,197 cases. Malaysia’s biggest spike followed an event at a mosque near Kuala Lumpur, after a failure to prevent mass religious gatherings.On the whole, Malaysia’s response has been led by health experts rather than politicians, said Rahman. When the health minister suggested on TV that drinking warm water was a cure, his comments were quickly rejected by Dr Noor Hisham, the director-general of health. “There was a clear conflict but that conflict was good,” said Rahman. “In the UK there has been a pretty close synergy between political leaders and technical experts. I don’t know if that results in better global health responses.”Likewise, when the Malaysian deputy health minister, Noor Azmi Ghazali, was photographed breaking strict lockdown rules, he was fined. It sent a strong message to the public, she added.Restrictions on movement in Malaysia were particularly strict. Only one person per family was allowed outside for groceries, and people were not allowed out for daily exercise. It has been suggested that heat or humidity could slow transmission, but experts say there is no evidence for this. Other factors, such as the rural profile of countries such as Cambodia, could influence transmission, Li said. “High-risk events are not common here,” she added. The young demographic in some countries may also mean populations are less vulnerable.Yet such factors, experts say, cannot be relied on to protect a country as business reopens. In Bangkok, which enjoyed a brief moment of clean air during its lockdown, the roads are once again heaving with traffic. Markets have come back to life – though with plastic screens at dining tables, near ubiquitous mask-wearing and temperature scanning. As countries look to ease travel bans, and rebuild economies, health teams are aware there is no room for complacency."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278717.1592060397!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"opening ireland s schools government accused of getting ahead of medics and scaring people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tASTI general secretary Kieran Christie: ‘With the greatest respect to Minister McHugh, I’m not aware he has medical expertise.’ Photograph: Tom HonanThe Teachers have accused the Government of “getting ahead of the medics” after Minister for Education Joe McHugh indicated there are plans to fully reopen all schools by September using “class bubbles” with no requirement for social distancing between pupils.But on Saturday general secretary of the Association of Teachers Union Ireland (Asti) Kieran Christie said: “With the greatest respect to Minister McHugh, I’m not aware he has medical expertise. ” The minister had been “congratulating himself” on achieving consensus over the cancellation of Leaving and Junior Cert exams, but he would not get any consensus on reopening schools if he continues “musing aloud in the absence of any medical advice”, Mr Christie said. “Teachers and parents simply won’t wear that,” he added. A Department of Education study brought to Cabinet on Friday argued even if the current two-metre distancing requirement was reduced to one metre, primary school students would still only be allowed to attend school for 2½ days out of five.In secondary schools, certain year groups would be able to attend only 50 per cent of the time. Under the current two-metre rule, pupils in primary schools could only attend one day a week, while secondary students could attend for two days.‘Scaring the bejaysus’Mr Christie said Department of Education officials briefed the teachers’ union as recently as Friday that it was ruling out the use of face coverings in schools when they do reopen. “It is very difficult to pin anything down here,” he said. Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty accused Mr McHugh of “scaring the bejaysus” of people with a suggestion that students could not fully return to school after the summer under social distancing rules. The minister sparked “complete confusion and complete anxiety” with his remarks while the government had “absolutely no plan” for reopening education, he told RTÉ Radio One. “What minister Joe McHugh said was completely incoherent, it was contradictory ,” he said. Mr Doherty said the minister was supposed to announce a plan - three months after schools had shut down - for getting children back to classes in September, but instead only voiced an “ambition”. “What the minister did yesterday was scare the bejaysus out of people,” he said. There has been no government engagement with inidual schools and teachers and headmasters “don’t have a clue what is coming down the line”, he added. ‘Determination’Martin Heydon, chair of Fine Gael parliamentary party, suggested all students could return to school in September without any social distancing rules in place. Mr Heydon said the Cabinet agreed on Friday to have the “determination” that every child will be back at school in September “because everybody will be back at work in September”. Defending Mr McHugh’s announcement on Friday that social distancing in schools would mean hundreds of thousands of pupils not being able to attend, Mr Heydon said the government has “time to plan” between June and September for all students to return after the summer. There would be “much more clarity” on the plans in “two to three weeks time”, the Kildare South TD said.

It accesses funding for homeowners under different Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) programmes and currently can offer a maximum of 35 per cent. A 50 per cent deep retrofit grant was available under the SEAI’s trial deep retrofit programme from 2017 to June 2019.“The number of people who wish to do this renovation is clearly evidenced from this report,” said TEA chief executive Paul Kenny. “But their dream of a comfortable, affordable and green home can’t come true due to the lack of approved financial institutions offering low-interest finance, the stop start nature of the grant aid, and confused and unclear information.”The AIB green mortgage was a good example of the kind of financing which could help increase retrofitting, he said. It offers a 2.45 per cent fixed rate for all A1 to B3 energy-rated homes. “When you consider the energy savings that come from retrofitting, and interest savings over a long time you may find that the retrofit won’t cost you any money,” he added.On concerns about technicalities casting doubt on whether a deep retrofit could be done in particular houses, he said, there were “no technical issues that can’t be solved” though solutions could sometimes be cost prohibitive, he accepted.Likewise concerns about time and lifestyle disruption, could be minimised by having a well-organised contractor, in particular for the works inside the house. Under the SuperHomes scheme the agency offers a professional engineer to work with the contractors.TEA has secured significant EU funding recently to further the development of its domestic retrofit scheme, which is supported by the EU Horizon 2020 programme. Other project partners are the ESB Limerick Institute of Technology, Sustainability Works and the European Heat Pump Association, who are committed to addressing challenges in scaling up domestic deep retrofit in Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270808.1591280343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spotted flycatcher is less likely to be spotted with each passing year","story":"Last year it was the mistle thrush that grabbed me – my affectionate attention, that is. Each morning as I marched out to measure the rain, he was perched on the gable’s broadband aerial and facing the sea in a full-flow performance.I’d stand beneath him, carefully still, admiring the measured, forceful phrasing, the avian oratory. His song carries, by some accounts, a couple of kilometres. And at length, his final, territorial peroration concluded, we could both move on.This year there have been distractions, among them the compelling entry of a little bird whose song (“ a few thin hasty notes”, as my field guide allows) is quite lost beyond my double-glazed bedroom window.This looks out to a low-fringed glade of rough grass and shady trees, oak and alder intertwined. For the spotted flycatcher, Muscicapa striata, it is the perfect arena for the ceaseless, urgent practice of his name.Many birds catch insects in the air – our swallows are at it all the time – but none behaves quite like the flycatcher.He chooses a perch on a twig with a view – it can become a daily favourite – and makes repeated, looping forays to seize his prey. The energy involved is impressive: a flurry of wings in a ing take-off, an arrow-swift glide to snap up the target, an instant turn and flurry of wings to propel him back to his original parch.This manoeuvre, made over and over at different trajectories and distances and flashing in the sun, kept catching my eye as I lay reading in bed, the mammoth third volume from Hilary Mantel propped up on a beanbag. Distracted from Thomas Cromwell’s devious doings at Henry’s court, I gave way to tracking the flycatcher’s own, quite hypnotic, manoeuvres.Rare visitorIt was the first such visitor in many years, migrating from a humid zone of west Africa by way of northern Spain. As perhaps the last of the summer’s arrivals in Ireland, what chance had drawn it to this one wooded acre on a sheep-shorn coastal hillside?Here in a gloom-laden west, last summer offered few flying insects: even the midges lay low. The contrast this year, boosted by the sun, just about sustains the bird’s hard work, together with the swoops of the swallows. Despite its name, mere flies are mostly for chicks in the nest, somewhere in a shadowy crevice. But the energy for ceaseless interception demands meatier fare – butterflies, moths, craneflies, damselflies, even bees or wasps, their stings scraped off on the twig.To read about birds these days is to expect more tales of decline. The British Trust for Ornithology reports an 89 per cent reduction in spotted flycatchers between 1967 and 2010. Ibis, the international journal of avian science, has added “great conservation concern” about the species.In Ireland, a new survey of countryside birds suggests a continuing fall in breeding flycatchers, perhaps of a quarter over the past couple of decades, and notably in the east midlands. Theories include predation of nests, perhaps even by grey squirrels, but other migrants from the flycatcher’s winter habitats in Africa have suffered severe declines, so bigger answers may lie there, in climate change or deforestation.Measuring lossThe Countryside Bird Survey is important and readable. Co-ordinated by BirdWatch Ireland, it’s the product of thousands of hours of fieldwork, mainly by volunteers, but also by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which publishes it online (npws.ie) as Irish Wildlife Manual 115. It tracks the fortunes of the common and widespread breeding birds between 1998 and 2016. That this now excludes the lapwing and curlew, from the difficulty of finding them, is a measure of their loss.The survey does correct a few popular notions about the loss of birds, not least my own casual belief that Ireland’s cuckoos shared in the UK’s long patterns of decline. “Perhaps surprisingly, in light of at least anecdotal evidence,” says the report, “the CBS shows a positive population trend of nearly 19 per cent.”On average, cuckoos have been recorded in 74 of the survey’s spread of 1km squares per year. These could certainly, this spring, have included our own hillside. One (or more?) cuckoos has been giving forth, almost non-stop through late May, to the weaker, counterpoint chorus from collared doves.One day I watched as a cuckoo, harried by a little mob of pipits, took refuge in the crest of the old Sitka spruce at our gate. She re-emerged from the dark canopy almost immediately and fled stage-left, still pursued by pipits. She may, of course, have met the mistle thrush’s mate, indignantly at home on the nest."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:     Pavel GolovkinAPThe wife of a Dublin businessman barred from leaving China for 15 months has made a direct appeal to the Irish Government to intervene and push for his release.Tara O’Halloran said her husband Richard has been largely confined to a hotel since an exit ban was imposed on him, the first of its kind in China against an Irish citizen.Speaking publicly about her husband’s detention for the first time, Ms O’Halloran said he has been caught up in complicated events that pre-date his time in the aviation leasing company he works for. She fears for his physical and mental health, and the risks he faces during the coronavirus pandemic given that he suffers from a lung condition.AccusedMr O’Halloran has been blocked from leaving the country over an investigation into Chinese businessman Min Jiedong, owner of Dublin-based China International Aviation Leasing Service (CIALS), the firm the Irish man works for, concerning peer-to-peer lending and crowd-funding.The authorities have accused Mr Min of illegally collecting money from the Chinese public in a crowd-funding scheme and using it to buy an aircraft, currently leased to an airline in Europe.Mr O’Halloran, who joined the company a year after the events under investigation, travelled to China in February 2019 to meet investors and assess the problems facing the firm. After a week of meetings in Shanghai, he was detained at passport control at the airport as he tried to board his flight back to Dublin. He was later issued with an exit ban.The businessman, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, has testified as a witness four times in the prosecution of Mr Min. However, he has not been permitted to leave China despite both the prosecutor and Mr Min telling the court he should be.The Chinese authorities argue that Mr O’Halloran promised to transfer the aircraft and leasing revenues connected to the plane back to the Irish company’s Chinese parent but has not done so.“Under this circumstance, Mr O’Halloran is restricted from leaving China by law,” the Chinese embassy in Dublin said in a statement.The embassy said the Chinese police and court are “actively investigating and handling the case of CIALS in order to protect the property rights and interests of the victims involved in the case.“It is hoped that Mr O’Halloran co-operates positively with the local authorities in Shanghai to bring this case to a successful conclusion at an early date,” it said.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is being asked to do something he cannot do under Irish law. “It is not possible . . . it is entirely out of his hands.”Ms O’Halloran says he has co-operated with the authorities in China and that it was “a matter for the authorities to bring matters to a speedy conclusion and to allow Richard to return home to his family”.FrustratedAfter an initial meeting with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and contacts with his department, Ms O’Halloran says the family have had no further feedback.“So far they have just paid lip service. My children want their dad back,” she says.She has been frustrated seeing the department helping bring others home.“With the Covid-19 pandemic, I see them repatriating everybody else from all over the world to come back to Ireland to be safe, yet they can’t get Richard home. He needs their help.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “We are aware of the case and are providing consular assistance. We do not comment on the details of inidual consular cases.”Ms O’Halloran said her husband missed the death of her mother in January, “nearly two lots of birthdays” and other important family occasions.His long absence has badly affected their four children, Ben (13), Amber (11), Isabella (eight) and Scarlett (six) who sleeps with a framed photo of her father.“It is very difficult for them to understand because we don’t know when he is coming home or even if, at this stage,” she says.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is permitted to leave his hotel but she fears the virus would “kill him” if he contracted it. He largely confines himself to his hotel room.“It has definitely taken a huge toll mentally and emotionally. It is horrific.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278781.1592129195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaders set to sign off on government deal as agreement reached on transport and 7 target","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar, Eamon Ryan and Micheál Martin were expected to meet on Sunday to sign off on a government deal. File photograph. The negotiating teams from each of the potential partners in a new coalition government met until the early hours of Sunday morning as they largely settled a new policy framework for next five years. It is not yet clear what time Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan will meet today to formally sign off on the deal, which will then be subject to the approval of each of the wider party organisations.Among the issues expected to be settled by the three leaders are pensions policy, Fine Gael’s desire for tax cuts at some point in the lifetime of the next government if economic circumstances allow, and social welfare policy. Another issue to be settled by the leaders is a mooted ban on imports from occupied territories.Sources involved in the talks overnight however said that, on some of those issues, a “pathway” towards a solution had been worked on by the negotiating teams for the leaders.Mr Martin, Mr Varadkar and Mr Ryan will be expected to agree and sign off on the wording of such policy areas in the new programme for government, with one source suggestion that the leaders had the most work to do in the areas of pensions and tax.It is understood that it has been agreed that the carbon tax will rise to €100 a tonne by 2030 as requested by the Greens, and that the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure, including the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant earmarked for the Shannon estuary area, will be halted - another key demand for the party. It has also secured its main policy aim of accelerating Ireland’s carbon emissions reduction to an average of 7 per cent a year to 2030.The carbon tax will not change to a “fee and idend” model as requested by the Greens, but its proceeds will remain ring-fenced for measure to tackle climate change, as is currently the case. There will, however, be an agreed breakdown of where the revenue raised by the tax will be spent and the wording around this needs to be agreed by the three leaders. TransportOne of the main issues of contention in Saturday’s marathon talks session in Agriculture House in Dublin city centre was around transport policy but a deal was struck which will see future capital investment split on a 2:1 basis in favour of public transport over roads. If, as is widely anticipated, the deal is signed off by the leaders on Sunday, the final document will likely be sent to each of the respective parliamentary parties on Monday. It is likely that meetings of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green parliamentary parties will take place then to discuss and assent to the deal. One of the key elements which will be watched out of those meetings will whether there is opposition to the deal from any TDs and senators in each party.Sources in both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are increasingly confident that Catherine Martin, the Green Party deputy leader who is challenging Eamon Ryan to be leader, will back the deal, although Ms Martin has not said anything publicly. Each party will also have to engage in a wide internal ratification process to approve the deal. Both Fianna Fáil and the Greens will hold a one member, one vote postal ballot of all their members. Internal Fine Gael ratification is through an electoral college. TDs, Senators and MEPs make up 50 per cent of the voting strength, followed by 25 per cent for constituency delegates, 15 per cent for councillors and 10 per cent for the executive council.A negotiating team member from another party said: “There is nothing left for the negotiators.

Photograph: Ronan McGreevy If only queuing was a sport, Decathlon might add to its list of accessories, along with the 72 other sports it caters for in its Ballymun flagship store.The spectacle of Irish people patiently and, of course, socially distancing in queues has become commonplace in recent days. We could enter a team in the Olympic games and stand a chance of winning a gold medal.And we have had plenty of practice lately - when you have been locked down for months, maybe even queuing seems like an interesting activity.By the time Decathlon opened its doors at 10.30am there were upwards of 500 people waiting outside forming a line around the outside of the building and through the indoor football pitch which will open in the coming weeks along with the basketball court, the outdoor gym, the climbing wall and the cycling track. This is one shop that parents will not have to drag their children to.People clapped and cheered, and that was just the staff who came out a few minutes before opening time to greet the early arrivals. Then, inside, they clapped the first 150 customers through the door.Decathlon’s English-born manager Kieran O’Shea waved his arms about to ratchet up the enthusiasm level. He says the company looks for “vitality and responsibility” more than anything in its staff.His name comes from his Irish-born grandfather. “I hope I’m doing him proud. He would be here today but for Covid-19 restrictions,” he said.You would think the 67 employees owned the place and to a certain extent they do, explained the company’s Irish chief executive Bastien Grandgeorge as they all have shares in Decathlon.He said Decathlon is here to stay in Ireland as they have bought, not leased, the site in Ballymun, investing €13 million in the 4,000 square metre store. “I know. I spent the money,” he added.It as a three-year project to open its first shop in the Republic, which was due to be completed in April, but the opening was postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Decathlon is called the “Ikea of sports” and its location beside Ikea is no accident. Decathlon is betting that, having spend hours in one vast windowless retail emporium, the enthusiasm of customers will not be dimmed for another one next door.Decathlon has also borrowed many of Ikea’s techniques from - it designs and sells its own equipment, piling it high and selling it cheap.Prices too are competitive, bicycles from €250, six man tents for €150, rowing machines for €150 (already sold out) and footballs for €5.Almost everything in stock is own-brand so customers looking for club football shirts or branded runners, the biggest sellers in other sports shops, will have to look elsewhere.Reese Doyle from Ballyfermot decided to come on a whim and was well pleased with his Triban hybrid bicycle which cost €260. “I was inside my house today and I said I had nothing else to do. I haven’t had a bike in about 10 years. I need one for work. I can’t rely on the buses,” he said reflecting the views of many people who are now switching from public transport to cycling.Michelle Kueirozdesa, a Brazilian native, was first in the queue. She arrived with two friends before 8am. “We thought they were going to open at 9am, but it was good to get here early. We are looking for some weights and stuff like this.”Karen Wright arrived just before 8am with her daughter Noorsalem (11) to buy equestrian gear.“We live locally. It’s wonderful that a whole new generation of people will associate Ballymun with something so positive,” she saidDecathlon has big plans for Ireland. It plans to open new outlets in Cork and Galway with a view to opening a total of between six and nine shops in the Republic of Ireland, in addition to the outlet it already operates in Northern Ireland.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278798.1592133156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the old lady was glaring about when dublin s queen victoria statue was removed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe statue of Queen Victoria in Dublin, dated after 1908. Photograph: National Library of IrelandFlickr CommonsThe end, for Victoria, wasn’t particularly dignified.“As I watched, another workman appeared, clambering over her head, gripping her sometimes by the nose and occasionally sticking a finger into her disdainful eye. Perhaps it was just the effect of the glistening rain on the bright, green copper, but it seemed to me that the old lady - never exactly pleasant-looking at the best of times - was glaring about with loathing and disgust.”So reads an account in The  of the removal of the controversial statue of Britain’s Queen Victoria that stood for more than 40 years at Leinster House.The scenes are described in the Irishman’s Diary of the following day, July 23rd, 1948. She’s depicted on the front page, too - suspended by machinery as people look on. “Ministers, ex-Ministers and Dáil deputies stood around in the rain, waiting. There were crowds on the steps of the Museum and the Library and there were cameras everywhere. Meanwhile the workmen worked away with that maddeningly measured, deliberate air of men who know that they hold stage.“Several times we thought the big moment had come - once she did lurch from her pedestal for a second or two and creak back again - but just as everything was adjusted it would start to pour and everyone would have to rush for shelter.”In the end, Quidnunc missed the finale. “For a while longer I watched the men adjust and readjust the girths around Victoria’s middle then I had to go up to the Leinster Bowling Club to see the South African match. When I returned, Victoria was missing from her pedestal.” The statue was later moved to Kilmainham.The piece - comical, yet dry and straightforward - unflatteringly describes an audience and spectacle much different to that on the day the statue was erected.‘Mutilated’Searching for references to Dublin’s statue of Queen Victoria throws up a couple of parallels in the archive of The . There’s the statue of Victoria erected in 1939 in Menton, France pushed into the sea when the Italians came during the second World War and later replaced. Further back, in November 1908, there was the “outrage” at the public gardens in the Indian city of Nagpur, where a statue of the queen was “mutilated the face daubed with tar and the nose and fingers broken.”In the years between Victoria’s visit to Ireland in 1900 and the unveiling of John Hughes’s statue in 1908, mentions of a public fund set up for its commission are plentiful. In the days before the unveiling, tickets for the ceremony were advertised - the price of admittance was one shilling, payable at the front hall of Leinster House. The aim, said one report, was to thin the anticipated crowd.The day she was unveiled - February 15th, 1908 - was, like the day she came down, punctuated by rain. “The ceremony was made the occasion of an imposing military display, but the lustre of the pageant was to some extent marred by a somewhat heavy shower which fell shortly before the formal part of the proceedings commenced,” reported The .Detachments of soldiers began to arrive from 2pm, for the unveiling at 3pm. “About 1,000 troops were on parade and as the various battalions, dressed in review order, with their bands, arrived on the scene they took up their allotted positions with bayonets fixed, forming a wide circle round the greensward, in the centre of which stood the memorial, with the beauty of its magnificently formed bronze figures as yet unrevealed.”‘A noble addition’The string would be pulled, the Lord Lieutenant’s speech made and the applause would ring out - as far as the report goes. The  hailed the statue as “a noble addition” to Dublin’s monuments, praising the sculptor John Hughes.As the years wore on, the lauded aesthetics of the piece would be repeatedly called into question. As Randolph Churchill wrote in an article published on the front page in November, 1945: “The largest and ugliest statue in Dublin is outside the Dáil, and is of Queen Victoria - denounced throughout Ireland in the last century as the famine queen.”The statue and the merit of keeping it in situ quickly became a topic of debate. In line with the struggle for Irish independence and rejection of imperialist Britain, the controversy crept into news coverage - particularly following the conclusion of the War of Independence and signing of the Anglo Irish Treaty in 1921. The arguments for and against removing the statue will be familiar.On the latter point, a letter writer in 1933 - when the statue was 25 years old - said: “At one time a new dynasty arose in Egypt, and, defacing all the monuments of an earlier age, earned the universal condemnation of all historians. It is to be hoped that we are more enlightened.” Another - a decade later - pondered whether it would be better to keep it in place, owing to its potential as a tourist attraction.In the latter part of 1943, the issue again hit the pages of The  when the Dublin Corporation passed a resolution requesting the government to remove the statue. The story was carried on the front page the next morning, on September 7th.Proposing the resolution, Councillor Micheál Ó Maoláin said it was odd that “the effigy of a lady whose name stank in the nostrils of past generations of Irishmen” should stand in front of Ireland’s Parliament House, while Lord Edward Fitzgerald had been forgotten. Every generation, he warned, would rise and revolt at the sight of it.On the same day, the leader in The  took a more moderate view compared to “the heat of Mr Ó Maoláin’s feelings”, yet gave the councillor credit on two counts. “Firstly the city would not be any poorer for a monument to Lord Edward, who was a patriot in a sense which is hardly understood nowadays. Secondly, if the Old Queen must be removed, Mr Ó Maoláin will have it done by law and not by dynamite.” The piece invoked the explosion at Stephen’s Green in 1937 that brought a large statue of George II and his horse to the ground.NeglectThe article also suggested it would be better to remove the statue than allow it to endure further neglect. “If it is true that the statue has never been cleaned since the signing of the Treaty - and certainly its musty green hue gives credit to the story - the joke is rather a poor one and reflects more discredit upon the House of Windsor.”The same “green hue” would catch the eye of Myles na gCopaleen (Brian O’NolanFlann O’Brien) the following month - albeit, he had a much different take. Over all, the writer was not overly bothered with its removal - her statutes were more harmful than her statues, as he put it. “Besides, look at it this way,” he wrote on October 2nd. “Time has given the mere Irish their revenge. The fact is that Victoria has turned green. Of hue she approaches our decent Irish letterbox. And it is the price of her.”In the days after the resolution was passed, cold water was thrown over the project. A story on the front page on September 8th reported that Victoria would be removed, just not yet. Costs were blamed.On November 1st, members of Ailtirí na hAiséirghe - a minor fascist party described then as a Gaelic revival organisation - crashed a Dublin Corporation meeting and shouted from the public galleries: “Get rid of all the symbols of slavery in the streets.” The episode made the front page of the paper and was reported in the British press.It would take until July 22nd, 1948, before the statue came down. Reports about the monument soon died off, bar one or two concerning potential Canadian buyers - the cities of London and Peterborough sought to purchase the statue in 1949, by which point it had “lain on its back in a field in Kilmainham”. But that fell through.In the end, it would be sent to Australia. The  reported the move ahead of time in a report on October 2nd, 1986, headlined: “Statue of Victoria given to Sydney.” Not quite the ending predicted by The  in 1943, when it said the structure would be removed “possibly to some new and friendly site, more probably to the scrapheap”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277697.1591993545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ucd professor asked to resign from eu committee over covid 19 claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Dolores Cahill claimed people who recover from Covid-19 are ‘immune for life’ after 10 days. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe A University College Dublin (UCD) professor, who chairs the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, has been asked to resign from a leading European Union scientific committee over online claims she made about the Covid-19 pandemic.In an hour-long interview with a popular alt-right activist on May 10th, which has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, Prof Dolores Cahill promised to “debunk the narrative” of the pandemic.Lockdown and social distancing is not needed to stop the spread of the virus, she said. People who recover are then “immune for life” after 10 days and deaths and illnesses could have been prevented by extra vitamins, she claimed.People with underlying health conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, could freely engage in society during the pandemic after spending a few weeks building up their immunity in this manner, she went on.Opposing vaccinations, Ms Cahill said “politicians and the media” are using Covid-19 “as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people and to make them more sick and to force vaccinations on us.”However, the European Commission said the claims made by Ms Cahill, a professor of translational medicine in UCD, could cause “significant harm”, if taken literally.‘Not compatible’Following this, Ms Cahill was asked to resign as vice chair of the Scientific Committee of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a partnership between the European Commission and the drugs industry to promote new drugs.“Professor Cahill has been requested by the Chair of the Scientific Council of IMI and the Executive Director of IMI to step down from her function,” the commission told The .“While as a private person, Professor Cahill is entitled to express her points of view, these are not compatible with the scientific foundations of the Innovative Medicines Initiative,” said a Commission spokesperson.Ms Cahill’s claims have also caused Berlin’s Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG), where she worked for eight years, to distance itself, saying it did not want to be associated in any way with the claims made.The IMI echoed these sentiments, saying that they were “shocked” to see her statements and that her views do not reflect those hold on Covid-19 by of IMI.A former Max Planck colleague, Prof Hans Lehrach said he was “really surprised” by Ms Cahill’s comments: “I have no idea why she says things like that,” he said.“There is absolutely no proof that people recovering from the disease are immune for life,” he said, reflecting the World Health Organisation’s understanding on the subject.Vitamins and minerals do help the immune system, but Mr Lehrach said he would “very much doubt” that they would defend against the virus. The vulnerable would be “pretty insane” to engage widely during the pandemic.Hydroxychloroquine treatmentMs Cahill also supported the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, one that has been supported, too, by US president Donald Trump. The drug, she said, is “safe and effective” in treating the disease.However, Prof Lehrach said that he would be “very careful” with hydroxychloroquine as testing had proven that it is ineffective as a treatment and has been known to cause death due to heart complications.The original interview has since been removed by YouTube, but versions can still be found easily online and have clocked up hundreds of thousands of views. Ms Cahill has given a number of similar interviews since.Ms Cahill is a member of the faculty at UCD school of medicine, where she is the module co-ordinator on a number of subjects, including one taught to first-year medicine students called Science Medicine and Society.When approached for comment, UCD confirmed that she is part of the university’s faculty, but refused to comment further on her claims, saying only that they are “her own views”.Ms Cahill unsuccessfully contested the general election for the Irish Freedom Party in February, eliminated on the second count in Tipperary with a total of 527 votes. She has not replied to requests for comment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278735.1592076540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff fg and greens carve up taoiseach s 11 nominees to seanad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe 11 appointed senators are known as ‘the Taoiseach’s 11’.The break-down is akin to a soccer team formation - four, four, two and one - for the 11 Senators to be appointed to make up the Seanad’s full complement of 60. The 11 are known as “the Taoiseach’s 11”.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are expected to choose four Senators each while the Green Party will get to decide two nominees and the three parties will agree a Northern Ireland representative.Nominating a northerner is a long-held but intermittent tradition. In the main they have been unionist voices including peace activist Gordon Wilson, retired doctor John Robb and writer Sam McAughtry but have also included former SDLP deputy first leader Séamus Mallon who served briefly in 1982 and former Northern Ireland Ombudsman Maurice Hayes.Mentioned in dispatches is Derry woman Emma De Souza who won a political and legal battle to ensure Northern Ireland citizens will be regarded as EU citizens for immigration and family unification purposes.She rejected a British Home office requirement that she must renounce British citizenship before being able to rely on rights to Irish citizens in the Belfast Agreement to seek residence rights for her US-born husband.Also in contention is unionist and former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union Ian Marshall who won a Seanad byelection in 2018 with cross-party backing including that of Sinn Féin but was unsuccessful in the Seanad general election.After that it will be a nightmarish task to pick nominees for the Seanad from hundreds of applicants.Fine Gael had an embarrassing Seanad election when no women won seats and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pledged that most if not all of the party’s nominees will be female.However there is speculation former TD Noel Rock who lost his Dublin North West seat may be the one male selection. Some in the party oppose his preferment, demonstrated in his poor showing in the Seanad election. The colourful politician lost his seat in part because the constituency boundary changed and there are no party councillors there now but critics say it became the Noel Rock rather than the Fine Gael organisation.A Seanad seat “is hers for the asking” according to some sources when asked about Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty who lost her Dáil seat. But she is also mentioned as a frontrunner for the powerful role of party general secretary when incumbent Tom Curran retires.Cllr Mary Seery Kearney based in Templeogue Dublin is expected to get the nod for the Seanad to build a profile to win back a Dublin South-Central seat.Cllr Aisling Dolan who performed well in the Seanad election is also on the radar for Roscommon-Galway where there is no Fine Gael TD.Some have mentioned Salthill Cllr Clodagh Higgins a sister of former Labour senator Lorraine Higgins while a further prospect is Castlebar Cllr Donna Sheridan after former senator Michelle Mulherrin decided to step back. Meath East Cllr Sharon Tolan who performed well in the Seanad election has also been mentioned.The well regarded former Limerick senator Maria Byrne who lost out in the Seanad election may struggle to be selected with sitting TD Kieran O’Donnell in place in the city.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is not expected to nominate former high profile TD Kate O’Connell although he has been known to surprise. Critics of the outspoken politician acknowledge that “whether you like or dislike her” she would be an articulate, intelligent and questioning voice for the party in the Upper House.Fianna Fáil has received “tens of dozens” of requests for a prized nomination. All eyes will be on whether former Clare Fianna Fáil TD Timmy Dooley will get the nod after his party colleague Cathal Crowe took the Dáil seat in the county. He also failed to get elected to the Seanad which some attribute in part to his poison chalice role as director of elections in previous Seanad elections.Former Cork South-West TD Margaret Murphy O’Mahony, a staunch campaigner for the disability sector is in the frame while former Louth TD Declan Breathnach has also been mentioned. Both lost their Dáil seats and were unsuccessful in the Seanad election.Long-time Cllr Mary Fitzgerald could be considered for Dublin Central where the party has no TD while Cllr Deirdre Heney polled well in Dublin Bay North and Shay Brennan, son of former minister Séamus Brennan came close to a seat in Dublin Rathdown.Lorraine Clifford-Lee who lost her Seanad seat has been mentioned as the party looks at two seats for Dublin Fingal next time around and it remains to be seen if the well regarded Gerry Horkan can make the final cut after his surprise defeat in the Seanad election.Most Green party sources say look at the election results when it comes to picking a name for a Seanad nominee. The party has a swathe of candidates who got close to the line including popular Kildare North Cllr Vincent P Martin, a brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin.Up and coming Cork City Cllr Lorna Bogue is also seen as in the frame for her Cork South-Central performance, along with colourful Clare Cllr Róisín Garvey.Cllr David Healy was close in Dublin Bay North while long-term Louth Cllr Mark Deary has worked hard to maintain the party’s profile in Louth. A seat for Cllr Peter Kavanagh could help his Dublin Mid-West battle with former high profile Green Paul Gogarty.It remains to be seen if Mayo native Saoirse McHugh who has spoken out against coalition with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will get nominated. She secured a high first preference vote in the Seanad election but did not get sufficient transfers to win a seat.Dublin city Cllr Hazel Chu had originally been thought a potential candidate in the Seanad election but could now possibly be the next lord mayor of Dublin.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"remember brexit it s back and yes there s another impasse","story":"So Brexit is back in the news? Yes. The UK left the EU at the end of last year – so Brexit happened – but negotiations are now under way to try to agree the shape of its future relationship with the EU, particularly on trade. Because the UK entered a transition period after it left the EU not much has actually changed since then, but this is due to run out at the end of the year. The UK said formally on Friday that it would not seek an extension to the transition period – if this was to happen it had to be agreed by the end of June.But there are a few months left for talks still? There are. But the talks so far have made little progress, need to quickly get a new impetus if there is to be any chance of reaching a deal by the end of the year. There is to be an online conference between UK prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday, followed by intensified talks from the end of June. Trade deals are complicated and the EU side will need time to ratify any deal, so we could be heading for a period of drama in the autumn to try to finalise an agreement.What if there is no deal? If there is no deal then the UK leaves the EU trading bloc at the turn of the year. Trade would continue on what are called World Trade Organisation terms, meaning tariffs, which are special import levies, on trade between the EU and UK and a host of new customs procedures and delays. Some of these might apply anyway even if there was a deal, but a no-deal exit from the trading bloc would be more damaging. This would be like the no-deal Brexit we were threatened with at the end of last year, with a big impact on the Irish economy.The UK has said it will give some leeway to goods entering from the EU by not imposing full checks or requiring immediate tariff payments until July of 2021.What about the Irish Border? This is where a departure without a trade deal would be different from the no-deal Brexit feared last year. Under a special protocol agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, the UK signed up to a new trading arrangement for Northern Ireland designed to avoid the need for Irish border checks and infrastructure, even if no trade deal is completed by the end of this year.How this will work is being agreed by a special committee, and here too there are difficulties. Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said in the Dáil recently that a recent paper from the UK, while it did provide some clarification, still left a lot of uncertainty in areas like customs, tariffs and VAT checks. Under the agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU single market rules for goods and will make the necessary checks on goods, food and animals entering the North from Britain. The EU is insisting these checks are full and detailed as there will be no further controls at the Irish Border when they enter the EU single market.What are the implications for Irish business if there is no trade deal concluded? It would be a hit for Irish exporters to the UK, particularly the food sector with McEntee estimating this week that tariffs of €1.35 billion would be imposed on annual Irish food exports to the UK, which are valued at around €5.2 billion. The beef sector, which would face the highest tariffs, would be most exposed and this would feed back to jobs in the Republic, cattle prices and farm incomes. All goods exporters and importers trading with the UK would face costly new procedures and potential delays. New tariffs on imports from the UK would push up supermarket prices, likely to cost shoppers more than €1,000 a year on average, according to an ESRI study. Given the economic uncertainties of surrounding coronavirus, a UK exit without a trade deal at the end of this year would threaten a double whammy to the Irish economy and particularly to rural Ireland.What are the sticking points in the talks? The key issue is the terms on which the UK would be given access to the EU’s single market and what price it would pay in terms of aligning with EU rules and regulations. The EU side argues that as it has left the EU, the UK can no longer have the same access as it did, and must sign up to what are called level playing field provisions – sticking by EU rules in areas such as labour rules, state aid to businesses and the environment – if it wants to do so. The UK says the EU is making unreasonable demands. Specific issues such as fisheries, which were due to be concluded by July 1st, complicate matters further. As was said many times last year, the clock is ticking.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

That was the highest since mid-April and included 36 in the capital, Beijing, a city of 20 million people.Beijing’s cases were all linked to its biggest wholesale food market, which was shut down on Saturday, the official China News Service reported, citing the city’s disease control agency. It said 27 worked there and nine had direct or indirect exposure to it.The Xinfadi market was closed after 50 people tested positive for the virus in the Chinese capital’s first confirmed cases for 50 days.The world is seeing more than 100,000 newly confirmed cases every day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.China, where the pandemic began in December, and other countries that suffered early on including South Korea, Italy and Spain have seen numbers of new infections decline. Brazil, India, the United States and other countries are seeing large increases.China responded to the outbreak with the world’s most intensive anti-disease controls, isolating cities with some 60 million people and shutting down much of its economy in steps that later were imitated by some other governments.The ruling Communist Party eased most limits on business and travel after declaring victory over the disease in March. Some curbs still are in place, including a ban on most foreign travellers arriving in the country.On Saturday, authorities in Beijing locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market. White fencing sealed off a road leading to apartment buildings and drivers were required to show identification to enter the area.South Korea’s government reported 34 more coronavirus cases, adding to an upward trend in infections.The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said 30 of the new cases were in the greater Seoul area, where half of the country’s 51 million people live. New cases have been linked to nightlife establishments, church services, a large-scale e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers.The Egyptian Health Ministry announced 1,677 new confirmed cases. Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous country and has its highest coronavirus death toll. The country has reported 1,484 deaths and 42,980 confirmed cases.In the US, the number of new cases in the south-western state of Arizona has risen to more than 1,000 per day from fewer than 400 when the state’s shutdown was lifted in mid-May, according to analysis by the Associated Press.Governor Doug Ducey has not ordered Arizona residents to wear masks in public despite warnings by health experts outside the government.Elsewhere, bar owners in New Orleans were preparing to reopen. San Francisco restaurants resumed outdoor seating on Friday and the California government allowed hotels, zoos, museums and aquariums to reopen.The states of Utah and Oregon suspended further reopening of their economies due to a spike in cases.Suspend flightsThe latest Chinese cases raised the mainland’s total to 83,132, with 4,634 deaths, according to the Health Commission. South Korea has reported 12,085 cases and 277 deaths.Also on Sunday, China’s air regulator announced that China Southern Airlines was required to suspend flights between Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the southern city of Guangzhou for four weeks after 17 passengers on Thursday’s flight tested positive for the virus.Beijing allows each airline to make one flight per week on each route.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritain has formally rejected an extension to the post-Brexit transition period and the EU has acknowledged the decision as definitive, so the standstill arrangement will end on December 31st. British cabinet office minister Michael Gove met European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Friday as the joint committee to implement the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK convened for the last time before the June 30th deadline for Britain to request an extension to the transition period.Mr Sefcovic said that although the EU remained open to extending the transition period, Mr Gove “was very clear, unequivocal, on the fact that the UK is not going to seek an extension”. “We take this decision as a definitive one,” Mr Sefcovic said.Britain said on Friday that it would phase in a light-touch customs regime for goods entering the UK from the EU, with full border controls not coming into force until July 2021. The freight transport industry welcomed the staggered introduction of controls, which the British government said was a response to the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic.“We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period. The moment for extension has now passed,” Mr Gove said.\u0026nbsp“At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders, which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust. Today’s announcement is an important step towards getting the country ready for the end of the transition period.”Controlled imports such as tobacco and alcohol will be subject to full customs checks and tariffs from January, but importers of other goods will have six months to prepare customs declarations and pay tariffs.Devolved governments rowThe Scottish and Welsh governments, which have called for an extension of the transition period, withdrew from planned talks with the British government about Brexit strategy on Friday evening.“We cannot accept a way of working in which the views of the devolved governments are simply dismissed before we have had a chance to discuss them. In reality, the meetings we have had have simply been an opportunity for the UK government to inform us of their views, not to listen or respond to ours,” they said.British prime minister Boris Johnson will hold talks by video on Monday with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and European Parliament president David Sassoli. The two sides have scheduled six meetings over the summer, with negotiating rounds on the future EU-UK trading relationship in August, September and October, alternating between London and Brussels if health restrictions allow.“With some six months to go before the end of the transition period we still have lots of work to do. This is true for all work streams, but in particular with regard to the Protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland. The window of opportunity to put in place the operational measures needed to ensure that the protocol can function as intended on January 1st, 2021, is rapidly closing,” Mr\u0026nbspSefcovic said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"dare left say cant conservative little short racism","story":"It seems only fitting to discuss my “coming out” story during Pride month, a time of year we’re encouraged to celebrate ersity of all kinds. It’s unfortunate, however, that the irony is lost on the Left, who can only tolerate ersity if it’s skin deep. Dare stray from their approved cultural narrative, and you’re perceived as a dangerous threat.When I first “came out” as a Conservative voter in the staff room of the state secondary school I taught in at the time, you would have thought I had just admitted to supporting child labour. The dropped jaws and audible gasps were that of a typical Nineties cartoon. My colleagues were aghast. Suffice to say the reaction was tenfold when I later stood as a Tory candidate in Brent. The first of many abusive letters I received read, “Calvin I can only admire what a good house pet you have become as your slave masters taught you so well” (sic).Hostile reactions from Leftists are something most Right-leaning iniduals have become accustomed to. That’s why Conservatives form the silent majority it’s often easier to stay quiet than to face ostracisation for erting from the groupthink mentality of the Left. This situation is even worse for BAMEs on the Right.The Left seems to think they have a monopoly over us – as if our voting intentions should be determined by the colour of our skin. It’s unthinkable to believe in freedom, democracy, the rule of law and giving people a hand up instead of a handout. You’re brown you must vote Labour, believe “the system” is against you and that the world owes you a favour.It’s nothing short of racism. As a BAME, unless you’re a socialist, you’re considered a race traitor. Capitalism is for white folks only, apparently.It’s people like Florence Eshalomi, the Labour MP for Vauxhall, who would prefer to put us back in our boxes. When Priti Patel exposed her vulnerable side by sharing horrific incidents of racial discrimination from her past in the Chamber this week, was Ms Eshalomi’s first response to show compassion and to be empathetic toward her fellow parliamentarian?Of course not – she and dozens of other Labour BAME MPs decided instead to write Priti a letter accusing her of “gaslighting the very real racism faced by black people and communities across the UK”. The irony of ironies. Ms Patel has faced an intense backlash from the beginning of her career like me, she’s the “wrong type” of BAME to the racist Left.The greatest shame of the terrible situation we find ourselves in at the moment, with racial tensions brewing and vandalism and violence spreading across the nation, is that the UK is an incredibly free and tolerant society. What we should be doing is celebrating our successes. Britain has come a long way, to be one of the most erse and accepting countries in the world. That didn’t happen by accident. Perhaps instead of focusing on the things that ide us, we could spend a little more time emphasising the things that bring us together.Calvin Robinson is a teacher and former Conservative candidateMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"primary schools told can open fully 15 pupil class size cap","story":"Primary schools will be able to accept children from all year groups if they are able to maintain a 15-pupil cap on class sizes, ministers are preparing to announce, following a major backlash over the re-opening of classrooms.The Government is expected to state that primary schools can allow pupils of all ages to return before the summer, if they have the necessary space and number of teachers needed to keep children in groups of less than 16.The disclosure comes as a senior forecaster said school closures may already have cost the economy about £22 billion, as it also emerged that the Chancellor warned colleagues that the shutdown would also impede social mobility.Separately, Boris Johnson has said a planned catch-up programme for those who have missed out on education would have “massive importance ... not just for economic purposes, but for social justice.”The Prime Minister is said to be concerned that many pupils will have been missing out on support at home, and access to remote learning.Secondary schools are allowed to open from Monday for Year 10 and Year 12, but only a quarter of pupils are allowed to be in the building at any one time.Non-essential shops will also be allowed to re-open from Monday. Primary schools were allowed to reopen to pupils in Reception, Year One and Year Six from June 1.Teaching unions have warned that allowing more pupils into many schools would be logistically impossible, on the basis that a 15-pupil cap on class sizes would need double the classrooms and double the teachers if all primary school pupils returned before the summer, in line with Mr Johnson\u0027s original plan.But fee-paying institutions have been lobbying ministers to give them a greater degree of autonomy over how many pupils they are allowed to welcome back to the classroom before the summer holidays.In the absence of permission from the Government, private schools warned that they were unable to secure the insurance cover they needed to reopen.A No10 source said: “The PM is acutely aware that school closures will have a disproportionate impact on all children, and particularly the most disadvantaged and vulnerable children.“He appreciates the consequences of months out of school, and this package will be focused on providing extended support for children.  Writing on the  website, Julian Jessop, an independent economist states national output is likely to have taken a hit of about £11 billion as a result of the closure of schools since March, while parents\u0027 lost earnings could amount to another £11 billion.In the longer term, every child affected could contribute two per cent less to the economy, he adds.Last week, in an address to the 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, expressed concerns about the impact of the closures on social mobility, stating: “I think every day that our kids are not in school is a tragedy ... I say it because I passionately believe in the power of education as the best tool we have to provide opportunity for all.”Meanwhile, an entrepreneur and racing driver challenging the legality of the Covid-19 lockdown has accused Mr Johnson of using a “trick of words” to shut schools.Simon Dolan wants to force a judicial review of the Government’s emergency measures which he claims have imposed “severe restrictions on personal liberty”.Mr Dolan said his legal team received a 58 page response on Friday night in which government lawyers said it is nonsensical for us to say that schools were closed, because they remained open for key workers and there had only been a \u0027request\u0027 that schools should shut their doors to other pupils.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 has boon traditional british reserve","story":"I’ve had a lovely lockdown: one third of my book, Welcome To The Woke Trials done (talk about something writing itself), and I even managed to create a popular social media meme as my bit for the corona-war effort.But you can have too much of a good thing and I must admit that I’m gagging to get back out there and invade people’s personal space once more. If I wanted to cover my face and not touch strange men, I’d have moved to Saudi Arabia long ago.I’m aware that not everyone feels like this. Many men, including my late father and my current husband, have a robust suspicion of physical contact between unrelated men I’m sure that both of them wereare anti-EU partly because they thought they’d have to start behaving like Italian chaps, not allowed to see a stubbly chin without chucking it. Now for the first time since before the death of Diana, a manly nod upon seeing a male acquaintance is not just acceptable, but humanitarian.Although for the hug-happy likes of me life will be all the poorer for no longer being an all-you-can-greet smorgasbord of smooching, as with all things about the New Normal – from limited foreign travel to not taking other people’s tapas – I’ll easily get over it because I’ve had enough fun, love and money for nine lifetimes. But think of the children!I’ve never been in the habit of feeling sorry for the Young Generation (unless you’re referring to the dance troupe of the same name who were forced to dress like third-rate cabin crew) but I wouldn’t want to be one of them now for all the heavily-tariffed tea in China.From kiss-chase at Mixed Infants to slow-dancing at the leaving disco, youth is a time when touch is the most important of the senses – that’s why kiddies are always being told not to put their hands in stuff. It now seems  surreal to think that the biggest pop group the world has ever known, composed of four grown men, once had a hit record in which they sang for a whole three minutes about wanting to hold your hand, driving teenage girls into frenzies.It’ll be hard for young people to hang out in crowded clubs, pubs and bars now, even if the powers that be decide that one metre’s distance is as good as two. They’ll still be able to drink cheap supermarket booze in cemeteries, as Goths always did, but under the present circumstances flirting with death might well be less attractive than it was before.Of course youth will always find a way to circumvent chaperones looking at the protests of the past fortnight, the ringleaders are very much the sort of kids who’d be hugger-mugger at festivals now if not for the pandemic. If I wanted to put a Pollyanna-ish spin on the inadvisably up-close behaviour of the rioters, I’d say that they’ve been driven nuts by lack of physical contact and are seeking to make up for it by sharing as much air with their fellow beings as possible.But whatever drives them, this is surely their last gasp – literally, for the unfortunates among them who may well have picked up more than a pamphlet at such gatherings.One of the saddest suicides I ever heard of was a person fished from a river many years back wearing a badge which if I’d seen it on a living person I would have ridiculed mercilessly but which on a corpse took on a new level of comment on the human condition: I NEED A HUG.The New Normal will be one in which those of us who do not need a hug will flourish maybe we’ll go back to calling each other ‘Miss This’ and ‘Mr That’ like we did in the olden days.I’ll get used to it. Though as a show-off I’ve enjoyed these decades of over-expression I know emotion isn’t all good, driving as it does everything from domestic violence to the putative destruction of statues of explorers by militant Flat Earthers or whichever group of loonies loses their collective temper next.

He said lifting it would be more likely months than weeks.Around 3.8 million Britons visit the United States in a normal year, to holiday destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Florida and Las Vegas. The travel ban was ordered by Donald Trump In March. There are some exceptions, including green card holders, those with American spouses, and UK government officials, but the vast majority of British citizens are effectively barred. Bans are also in place for the European Union, China, and Brazil.Dr Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert, said: It\u0027s going to be really wait and see. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s going to be an immediate pull back for those kinds of restrictions. My feeling, looking at what\u0027s going on with the infection rate, I think it\u0027s more likely measured in months rather than weeks.During the pandemic Dr Fauci, 79, has become America\u0027s most trusted official. Appearing alongside Donald Trump at White House briefings, the bespectacled immunologist emerged as the nation\u0027s best source of information in a bewildering timeWith infection rates now surging across a host of US states, and protests sweeping the globe, Dr Fauci expressed concern, and said the crisis was far from over.He added: “It is not inevitable that you will have a so-called \u0027second wave\u0027 in the fall, or even a massive increase, if you approach it in the proper way.The US has just passed two million cases, and 113,000 deaths. Nearly 1,000 people are still dying every day.As all 50 states now move toward reopening weekly infection totals are rising in 21 of them. More than a dozen, including Texas and Florida, have just reporting record daily totals. Oregon announced a one-week pause in reopening. Arizona\u0027s intensive care beds are 78 per cent occupied. Wall Street has plummeted amid the virus spikes.In many states protesters have taken to the streets calling for racial justice in the wake of the death of George Floyd, and that is fueling Dr Fauci\u0027s concerns, although he empathised with the need to protest.“I would say in a perfect world people shouldn\u0027t congregate in a crowd and demonstrate. But I know, even though you say that, they are going to go do it. So, if you’re going to do it, don’t take the mask off when you\u0027re chanting, and screaming, and yelling, and doing whatever at a demonstration.As in the UK there has been much debate in the US about whether reopening schools could contribute to a second wave. In the US schools will not be returning until September.Dr Fauci said decisions relating to schools should not be uni-dimensional, but instead based on local conditions.He said: In the US we\u0027re a very big country geographically - multiple, multiple times bigger than the UK - and we have a great deal of heterogeneity. The New York City metropolitan area is strikingly different from Casper, Wyoming. What we say is to look at the dynamics of the outbreak, what is the level of infection? What direction is it going in any given state, town or county?There are some places in the US where there is very little infection activity. Under those circumstances you can be much more liberal in deciding to go back to school. It isn\u0027t one size fits all, it depends on where you are. Now, I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s that much heterogeneity in the UK. If there is, then I think that would be applicable also to the UK.For Dr Fauci the Holy Grail is a vaccine, and he said there was good news. Moderna\u0027s vaccine will start a phase 3 trial in the first two weeks of July, he said. That is the final stage before potentially being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.Those vaccines could be ready for the end of the year, or early in 2021, and provide billions of doses, he said. He hopes there won\u0027t be reluctance to take them due to the anti-vaccination movement in the US.Coronavirus Task Force meetings are no longer daily and Dr Fauci spends less time at the White House these days. Democrats have accused Mr Trump of sidelining the task force as he focuses on reopening the economy. The white House has denied the accusation.Dr Fauci himself is focused on beating the virus, which he calls his worst nightmare. He never thought he would see such a devastating disease in his lifetime.Covid-19 is an explosive outbreak that in a couple of months spread through so many cities, and the world, he said. It puts everybody at risk, it doesn\u0027t care if you\u0027re rich or poor, it\u0027s everyone.But he added: This will end. As stressful and devastating as it is, it will end.

But Skane, the region around Malmo, had by last week registered just 17 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants due to coronavirus, slightly fewer than the 19 per 100,000 seen in the Capital Region of Denmark across the Oresund straits, even though Denmark went into heavy lockdown for two months from mid-March.Nearly half of Sweden\u0027s nearly 5,000 deaths have so taken place in Stockholm, giving the Swedish capital a harrowing death rate of 95 per 100,000. It can hardly be explained by differences in strategy, because we have had the same strategy as in the rest of Sweden, argues Per Hagstam, Specialist in Infectious Diseases in Skane, the health authority for the region surrounding Malmo. That our death rates aren’t higher is a result of the fact that transmission has not been so extensive down here.Part of the reason for that comes down to the different dates for the two cities\u0027 spring \u0027sports holiday\u0027 in late February and early March, when around one million people, a tenth of Sweden\u0027s population, travelled abroad.While Stockholmers travelled to the ski resorts of Italy and Austria, London and elsewhere in the week of peak transmission between February 24th and March 1st, Malmoites took their holiday a crucial week earlier and were also less likely to take international trips.Hagstam believes that Skane\u0027s health authority may also have been more successful than that of Stockholm at tracing and isolating the contacts of those who tested positive in late February and early March.As a result, Stockholm saw cases flare up earlier, meaning local health authorities and care homes had less time to put in place measures to protect the elderly.I think that one explanation could be that we had more time to prepare than Stockholm had: they had a very rapid infection, Gisela Ost, Director of Elderly Care in Malmo, says. I think that time is one of the factors that meant that we didn’t have so many infections.She had time to circulate guidelines and equipment to the homes she manages around Malmö, stop visits, and to start rigorously testing care home personnel who reported the slightest symptom.As a result, she says, only 100 of her elderly clients fell ill with the virus, with the number of infections peaking at 47 in April. About 20 of her clients have died, while she estimates that 85 per cent now recovered.  As well as differences in timing, Johan Carlson, Director General of the Public Health Agency, of Sweden, argued last week in an interview with the Dagens Nyheter newspaper on Wednesday that the huge regional differences in Sweden also reflected the way coronavirus spreads in clusters.The virus jumps to places and it\u0027s the same across Europe. In England it is London, and in Italy Lombardy, while Rome has been relatively spared, he told the newspaper.I has an extremely haphazard spread, superspreads which hit certain areas - not like the flu, which moves across the continent like a flood.It was not only Skane that has been hit less hard than the region across the border, he pointed out. Varmland, the region of Sweden bordering Oslo, is less badly hit than the Norwegian side, and Norbotten, Sweden\u0027s most northerly region is less badly hit than across the border in Finland.But neither Hagstam nor Ost are congratulating themselves yet, with Hagstam pointing out that while Skane has not had Stockholm\u0027s high number of infections and deaths, it has also not experienced the same peak and decline, instead seeing a constant low plateau. With lower levels of immunity than Stockholm, he fears, Malmö\u0027s peak could still be to come.  We have a lot of respect for this virus and we don’t think we have seen the end of the pandemic, even though we wish that we had, Ost says. We have to keep on working with the guidelines because we can’t say that it’s over. We don’t want to end up like Stockholm.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/10/17/coronavirus-google-trends-second-wave.jpg","title":"coronavirus second wave us google trends covid 19 symptoms","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Data reveals that online searches for terms like \u0027Covid-19 symptoms\u0027 have spiked in recent days in the USOnline search trends in the United States could indicate that a second wave of coronavirus infections is on its way.Google searches for terms like Covid-19 symptoms and Covid-19 testing near me have spiked in recent days.The concerning trend comes as lockdown restrictions in the US begin to ease, despite infection rates not falling as significantly as other countries emerging from lockdown.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe surge in search terms related to the coronavirus also comes amid mass public protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The US already has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, officially passing 2 million on Thursday.Looking more closely at Google trends in inidual US states over the last seven days reveals where most of the searches are coming from.This could potentially signal new and emerging hotspots of Covid-19.The search data correlates with an increase in new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in states where most of the searches were taking place.Both Arizona and South Carolina have seen the number of new cases rise over the last seven days, having previously avoided any significant outbreak.Nationwide searches for other terms that might indicate a new wave of infections have also risen in recent days, including the term coronavirus symptoms.While new coronavirus cases in the US have risen slightly since the end of May, there is yet to be a notable surge in the number of new cases. This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.More than half of Britons now support an extension to the Brexit transition period this year with this rising to two-thirds of people when potential shortages of medical supplies are factored in.New research by the Health Foundation and Ipsos Mori suggests the coronavirus outbreak has reshaped views of the EU and Britain’s link with the continent with a clear majority of the public supporting closer working with the EU to tackle the virus.As part of a wider survey of people’s experiences during the outbreak, 77 per cent said the UK should work “very closely” with the EU on Covid-19 responses with another 17 per cent saying it should work “fairly closely” with the EU.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe UK and EU are currently in negotiations over the longer term relationship after the Brexit transition period which is due to end on 31 December.The latest round of negotiations have stalled, with the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost saying the two sides had come “close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve”.Boris Johnson to hold talks with Macron amid Brexit talks deadlockUK set to backtrack on plans for full EU border checks from January 1Prime minister Boris Johnson is to hold talks with EU officials next week to try and break the deadlock.Of those surveyed by Ipsos Mori, almost all of those who voted Remain in the EU Referendum (99 per cent) supported working closely with the EU to combat the pandemic, and over nine in 10 (91per cent) of those who voted Leave also supported closer collaboration.Using two sample groups Ipsos Mori found 54 per cent of people said the government should request a Brexit extension beyond 31 December.A second group were given information that was in line with government estimates about potential delays to the supply of medicines and medical devices in the event of a no-deal. In total 65 per cent, two thirds, believed there should be an extension, 31 per cent said no.Young people, aged 18 to 24, were far more likely to support an extension.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This would come at the same time as the health service is facing significant pressures from seasonal flu, supporting people recovering from Covid-19, tackling the large backlog of patients who didn’t receive care during lockdown, and potentially coping with another wave of infection from the coronavirus.“This would be a vicious, and avoidable, combination of risks.”She added: “The public understandably prefer protection from risks that can be anticipated and avoided. This research suggests the public clearly prioritise the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and collaboration with the EU.”The House of Commons Health Select Committee warned in March 2018 that moving to WTO trading rules could impact the supplies of some medicines and devices that would not be covered by existing zero tariff rules. In the same year, health secretary Matt Hancock asked medical suppliers to stockpile drugs ahead of a no-deal Brexit.The survey also found four-fifths of Remain voters backed an extension to the transition while 66 per cent of Leave voters opposed an extension. Almost 40 per cent of Leave voters backed an extension once informed of the implications of a no deal scenario.The survey was conducted by using a representative sample of people aged 18 and over between 1 and 10 May 2020.A total of 1,983 people were interviewed with quotas set on age, gender, region and working status and data weighted to be representative of the population.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Walliams used black makeup and an afro wig to play the character Desiree DeVere, while Lucas used blackface to play Pastor Jesse King.Earlier this week, the show was removed from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and BritBox after it came under renewed scrutiny amid Black Lives Matter protests. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA spokesperson for the BBC said: “There’s a lot of historical programming available on BBC iPlayer, which we regularly review.

Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong and we are very sorry, Lucas tweeted.Lucas commented in 2017 that they made “a more cruel kind of comedy than I’d do now”. Come Fly With Me, the duo’s sketch show set at an airport that also used blackface and racially stereotyped characters, has also been removed from Netflix. A number of white celebrities have issued apologies for using blackface during sketch shows. TV presenters Ant and Dec apologised for their use of blackface and yellowface during pranks on the casts of Emmerdale and Coronation Street for Saturday Night Takeaway. In the US, Jimmy Fallon apologised over an SNL sketch from 2000, in which he can be seen impersonating the comedian Chris Rock. On Tuesday 26 May, Fallon tweeted: “In 2000, while on SNL, I made a terrible decision to do an impersonation of Chris Rock while in blackface.

Each of his 18 works went on sale for £912 each.The portrait of Sheeran was made in yellow and orange crayon, with two black dots for eyes. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFielding also completed a version of Sir Peter Blake’s iconic cover of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, and his “self-portrait”, which was a drawing of a star-studded boot.The gallery said: “Noel Fielding’s artworks bridge seamlessly the imagined worlds and counterculture references we have been led through, courtesy of The Mighty Boosh and Luxury Comedy.“Drawing on surrealism, dada and neo-expressionism, Noel’s body of work treats us to a feast of colour and a trip through the triangle window into his soul.”Fielding said of his work: “The characters I paint are often fantastical, usually half human half animal, strange magical beasts who roam my subconscious. It’s the same in my comedy – I’d rather play Old Gregg, a transexual Merman, than someone who exists in real life. “Acid Mouse is one of the characters I’ve painted a lot in the past year. He is a strange 7ft upright mouse with no arms, and breasts – he speaks through his tits and has shoes made from melted bubblegum and broken pieces of the American dream.”Musicians reveal how they are coping without touringNetflix removes The League of Gentlemen and The Mighty BooshJoe Lycett responds to Gal Gadot’s Imagine video with comedian friendsFielding recently made a number of appearances on Grayson Perry’s The Art Club, where he took the audience through the work he has produced during lockdown.The portrait sale comes after Fielding’s comedy sketch show The Mighty Boosh was pulled from Netflix, apparently over its use of the character The Spirit of Jazz, the ghost of fictional jazz musician Howlin’ Jimmy Jefferson.

And there are no front footprints.”Professor Kyung Soo Kim, who also authored the paper alongside Jong Deock Lim, Seul Mi Bae and Anthony Romilio, corroberated Professor Lockley’s view.This is because of how deep the animal’s heel left an impression in the fossil.“Our trackways are very narrow-looking - more like a crocodile balancing on a tight-rope,” he told the BBC. “When combined with the lack of any tail-drag marks, it became clear that these creatures were moving bipedally.Created with Sketch.Science Photographer of the Year shortlist  Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterningBubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

Twitter, like Facebook and other major social media sites, is currently banned in China.“We should expect continued evolution and improvement, given the enormous resourcing the Chinese party‑state can bring to bear in aligning state messaging across its diplomacy, state media and covert influence operations.” the ASPI wrote.The research pointed out a number of tactics from the Chinese government to attempt to shape the information environment to its advantage,” including:The coordination of diplomatic and state media messagingThe use of Western social media platforms to seed disinformation into international media coverageThe immediate mirroring and rebuttal of Western media coverage by Chinese state mediaThe co‑option of fringe conspiracy media to target networks vulnerable to manipulationThe use of coordinated inauthentic networks and undeclared political ads to actively manipulate social media audiencesAdditional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

I’ve been a delivery driver for Tesco for the last 16 years. Though I also worked for Tesco for four years before that. I knew that I’d have to continue till 63 but was never informed about the rise to 66.”Carolyn’s life was initially turned upside down by the controversial state pension age rise from 60 to 66 for women born after March 1950, which affected nearly four million women. The move was accelerated in 2010 and saw them reach parity with men, at 65, in 2018.Many of these women have been forced to carry on working through the Covid-19 emergency despite being at risk of severe complications from the virus due to their age.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCarolyn said working at Tesco throughout the lockdown has been immensely stressful due to other staff members refusing to respect her need to socially distance and even poking fun at her for wanting to do so.“There is no possibility of social distancing in our back room and I’m mocked by male, macho, much younger drivers for even trying to social distance,” the 64-year-old adds. “I’m so stressed with the whole situation and so upset by a government who’s throwing money here there and everywhere but doing nothing to protect me. I live on my own since my orce 14 years ago and all I want is to kiss and cuddle my kids, three granddaughters and 94-year-old dad again.”Campaigners argue changes to the state pension age unlawfully discriminate against women born in the 1950s. The United Nations has previously said women hit by the state pension age change are at increased risk of “poverty, homelessness and financial hardship” as a result.Pensioner backs do not resuscitate legal action after ‘brutal’ GP callBackTo60, a campaign group calling for full restitution for women affected by the changes, lost its landmark High Court battle after taking the government to court over the state pension rise, but will be appealing the ruling in July.Joanne Welch, the group’s founder, told The Independent they were confident about the appeal.“When they were robbed of the state pension with virtually no notice from the government, some of the women’s lives were annihilated and that is no exaggeration,” she adds. ”But when the pandemic hit, 1950s women were forced out on to the frontline. Many work in retail, hospitality, cleaning and care homes. We know women are facing homelessness and destitution. They have no choice not to work because they are not entitled to sufficient benefits. There are some workplaces where risk assessment not in place.“Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said people over 60 were at higher risk of developing severe coronavirus. There is a higher death rate for us. But the government is saying over 70s need to shield, not over 60s.“1950s women feel abandoned. They tell us they were robbed and now they are abandoned amid a pandemic. I would have never got involved in this if I didn’t believe it was an injustice. I’ve never done anything like this in my life.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have always worked – going back to work after having each of my three children. Over the last two years I have struggled with ill health which has impacted on my job as a community nurse.Coronavirus and food banks: The stories behind the statistics“Due to this I had to reduce the hours that I work, but I am still struggling as I need a new hip, and I am in constant pain with this and back pain. I am also struggling with my memory and cannot retain a lot of the information required to do my job safely, which has caused me to suffer with depression. I have been off sick for the last eight weeks. The thought of going back to work makes me feel physically sick as I am terrified that I will make a mistake. I cannot afford to stop working as my husband only revives a state pension. I feel trapped.” A major report by King’s College London which came out last month found the rise in the state pension age has triggered a 30 per cent rise in the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms for women doing physically and psychosocially onerous jobs.Researchers said these roles were defined by the mixture of high demands and low levels of control – explaining around a third of women work in these sorts of positions, which involve toiling away in restaurants, sales, personal care, housekeeping, machine operation and cleaning.Debbie de Spon, of Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI), said women have been penalised by the government due to the maladministration of state pension age changes.She added: Coupled with inequalities in life expectancy across the country and a substantial pensions gap, WASPI women continue to suffer huge financial losses. Currently many have fallen through the gap of Covid-19 support arrangements, and fear for their future.Jane, another woman hit by the pension change, said the public health crisis had also wreaked havoc on her working life.“I was 65 last weekend,” she says. “The day before I got told I possibly have heart failure. I am still working and feel like I can’t work any longer. I work for £400 a month less than I was in 2010 due to government pay cuts. I feel so angry and stressed that I might not live to see my pension that I have worked since I was 15 for. Even having four children I worked with only six weeks off when they were born. I feel totally robbed. I am trying to pay for my funeral. It’s a pity when I got so close to it, to lose it. Hopefully, there will be something they can do to keep me going long enough to enjoy my retirement in September. But there’s a possibility I will not. Furthermore, I couldn’t afford to keep my house in 2010 so that had to go. I’ve been part-time for six months. My money has run out.”*Names have been changed to protect identities Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Families that lost their homes in the Grenfell Tower blaze are still waiting for permanent housing three years after the tragedy.More than 200 homes were lost in the blaze on 14 June 2017 that killed 72 in the West London tower and the walk beneath it.In the aftermath, hundreds of people who were left homeless due to the inferno, including many children, were placed in bed and breakfast hotels and temporary flats while they waited for permanent housing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow figures from Kensington and Chelsea Council show that there are still seven households living in temporary accommodation. There are also said to be around 10 households who used to live in the tower who have since requested to be moved again as they were placed into permanent that was unsuitable.Around half of these requests have been successful, with the others either unsuccessful or still pending, according to the North Kensington Law Centres (NKLC).Set date for removing cladding, Grenfell campaigners tell governmentGovernment backs away from June oath to remove Grenfell-style claddingGrenfell inquiry witnesses ‘must be given immunity from prosecution’Spike Western, housing paralegal at North Kensington Law Centre, told The Independent the delays stemmed from a failure by successive governments to provide adequate social housing.“The households who have still to be rehoused permanently following Grenfell are the most vulnerable survivors. They represent either those with particular housing needs, such as those arising from a disability, or those on whom moving permanently is something that cannot be rushed and must only be done when the survivor is ready,” he said.“The damage has been done, and that is severe lack of investment in social and affordable housing over a long period, meaning there aren’t a whole lot of suitable options.Mr Western added: “We must remember that those affected by Grenfell are still awaiting justice, which has only been further delayed by the postponement of the inquiry due to Covid-19.”A spokesperson for Kensington and Chelsea Council said five of the seven households still waiting to be permanently re-housed had accepted a permanent home but not yet moved in, and that the council was continuing to support the remaining two households to find a home to settle in.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.England’s chief nurse was dropped from one of Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefings after refusing to publicly back Dominic Cummings, senior sources have told The Independent.As Boris Johnson’s chief aide was engulfed in scandal over his trips to Durham and Barnard Castle during lockdown, Ruth May had been due to appear alongside the health secretary Matt Hancock in the press conference.But, in practice questions hours before the briefing, she was asked about Mr Cummings and, after failing to give support to the prime minister’s chief adviser, she was immediately dropped from the press conference, according to senior NHS sources.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead the health secretary had to present the slides on Covid-19 himself for the first time, alongside Professor John Newton from Public Health England. The incident, on 1 June, was two days after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam sparked headlines by saying that lockdown rules “apply to all” when asked about Mr Cummings. He has not appeared at the press conferences since 30 May.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Another added: “JVT was the first to publicly push back on TV. Everyone is being asked to support the government positions prior to doing a press conference. If they don’t, they get dropped.“First it was Dominic Cummings, then easing lockdown and now the R-rate and the two-metre rule.”Separately, Whitehall officials are critical of what they see as No 10’s grip on the daily briefings and the way the science and health advice is being used.No 10 has previously touted the briefings – with ministers alongside health and scientific advisers – as an opportunity for the public to get advice directly from the experts on coronavirus. When they began in March, Downing Street said they would focus on informing the public “on how to protect themselves”.In April, when questions from members of the public were introduced alongside those from journalists, the prime minister’s official spokesman said it was “absolutely right that the public gets the chance to put their questions to the government and its experts”.Mr Johnson repeatedly insisted that public adherence to lockdown would not be affected by the revelations involving Mr Cummings.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Shapps said he was sure Ruth May would be back at the briefings in future.NHS England medical director Steve Powis said he did not know anything about “the various discussions”, adding: “I’ve been here many times saying exactly what I think.”Asked to comment, No 10 said it strongly denied the claims that Ms May had been dropped over her views on Mr Cummings and added that health and scientific advisers would continue to take questions in the briefings. NHS England was also approached for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Business lobby groups have also called for the rule to be relaxed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesI think Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance throughout all of this have provided advice to ministers and ultimately it\u0027s for ministers, whether it\u0027s me, the prime minister, health secretary, and others, we are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country, Mr Sunak told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show.People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions, but I think people are comforted and have confidence in those decisions if they know that we are taking advice from our scientists in what is ultimately a health crisis, informed a lot by what is happening with regard to the spread of viruses...Inside schools trying to cope as Covid-19 turns into education crisisRacism contributing to ethnic minority coronavirus deaths, leak saysMajority of Britons back Brexit extension to help beat coronavirusWhether they\u0027re scientific or others, advisors advise ministers, who are elected to make decisions and people can hold us accountable for those, ultimately.The statement by Mr Sunak is a change in messaging for the government, which has consistently claimed to be following the science in its policy throughout the crisis. The UK has suffered one of the planet\u0027s worst death tolls from the disease, behind only the United States and Brazil in total killed.Some scientists have suggested delays in introducing lockdown measures by Mr Johnson\u0027s government led to the significantly worse situation in Britain compared to other European countries, most of which are now returning to normal and reopening pubs, bars, cafes, and restaurants.Limitations and deficiencies in the government\u0027s test and trace regime, which was downgraded early on in the crisis while other countries built their capacity, are also thought to explain some of the differences.The prime minister\u0027s review of the two metre rule is expected to be completed by 4 July, the earliest date pubs and restaurants are expected be allowed to open in England. These businesses fear being hit hardest by the change as fewer people would be able to fit in a single establishment, reducing profitability.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailSpeaking separately on Sky News Mr Sunak said: “The Prime Minister has put in place a comprehensive review of the two metre rule. That review will involve the scientists, economists and others so that we can look at it in the round.You are right to highlight the impact it has on business I know that of course it’s the difference between three-quarters and maybe a third of pubs opening, for example, so it’s important that we look at it. Now that we have made good progress in suppressing the virus, we’re at a different stage of this epidemic than we were at the beginning and that enables us to take a fresh look at this.”Labour\u0027s shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the government should follow the science. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s binary. I think the first thing is science: what does the science say, follow the science. The second thing is be frank and honest with the public in balancing risk as you make that determination. I think the government\u0027s been slow: slow on testing, slow on lockdown, slow on PPE, and I think they\u0027ll be slow on this, he told the BBC.Created with Sketch.Inside US hospital: A day fighting the coronavirus Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works.

We would support the government on relaxing the rules, of course, as long as it\u0027s the right time to do it. None of us want to be in this state of lockdown and paralysis forever and indeed our economy at some point to open up again, all of us recognise that.He went on: “Many other countries around the world use a different rule and indeed, we’ve seen a couple of countries recently – I think Norway and Denmark – have moved from two metres to something less as well but it’s important that we look at it comprehensively in the round and that’s what we will do urgently… I can very much understand the impact, the positive impact it will have on business’s ability to reopen and thereby maintain the jobs that they have.”Some countries have less strict rules than two metres, though many also have other tougher conditions than the UK such as stricter requirements to wear face coverings.A snap poll by YouGov this week found that 58 per cent of people want the two-metre rule to be kept at the current distance, with 24 per cent agreeing it should be dropped to one metre.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They should be able to act, for instance,  if a site with planning permission is lying unused.Research by the LGA earlier this year found that more than a million homes given planning permission in the last decade have not yet been built.The association says the need to restart the economy means it is now imperative that councils are allowed to keep 100 per cent of receipts from Right to Buy sales. They also want the timeframe in which councils can spend the money to be extended from three years to at least five.

This includes making sure that councils retain the planning powers needed to deliver resilient, prosperous places that meet the needs of their communities.“The planning system is not a barrier to housebuilding. Nine in 10 planning applications are approved by councils.”He added: “Councils are committed to building the homes that communities need, making sure they are appropriate for the local environment, decent and fit for purpose, affordable, and with the right infrastructure in place.“Instead, councils need powers to tackle our housing backlog and step in where a site with planning permission lies dormant and house building has stalled.”Jenrick won’t answer questions over unlawful help for Tory donorChanges to the Right to Buy scheme would also allow councils to build “the new homes that people in their areas desperately need,” he added. Cllr Diarmaid Ward, who is in charge of housing at Islington Council in London, said the crisis had exposed how many people across the country live in precarious conditions or unstable accommodation.He called on ministers to cut the red tape around council home building, raise grant levels to 100 per cent of the cost of a new build home and abolish all restrictions on councils using their right to buy receipts.“It\u0027s time for the government to step up,” he said. “The last time the UK built 300,000 homes a year, in the 1970s, councils built over 40 per cent of them. There is no shortage of political will in local authorities to build council homes, but the government needs to stop stacking the system against us.An Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said:“Building the homes the country needs is a priority for the Government and we have re-started the housing market to help families and business return to normality in a safe way.”The government continues to work closely with all parts of the housing industry about the challenges they face during the pandemic.“We are committed to Right to Buy, which has helped nearly two million council tenants realise their dream of home ownership.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

First elected as an MP only in 2017,  Ms Moran insists her lack of experience could be a boon to the Lib Dems at a low point in their history. After the highs of “Cleggmania” in 2010, when the party was briefly riding high in the polls, the party came down to earth with a bump in 2015. Accusations of hypocrisy over the party’s support for tuition fees and other policies led to a slump in voter trust, leading to most of the party’s MPs losing their jobs. An anti-Brexit stance saw a revival in its fortunes in last year’s European parliament elections but a disastrous general election campaign saw its seat tally, which had been bolstered by defectors, fall again, to 11.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMs Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, says the message she has received from voters is that post-Brexit her party is “struggling for an identity”.       Asked if she thought the fact she had not been a part of the coalition government would be helpful, she said: “I think it would. And the reason why is that it sends the signal. I don’t intend to pretend that our party was not part of that coalition. It  was, it was part of our history. And it is really important that we learn the mistakes from it. And the big mistake was, of course, that you don’t as a politician say one thing and do another. We lost trust and we never really won it back. And it is unfair you could argue that it is still the yoke around our necks that it is.“And I would say to people, imagine what we can do with me as leader, without the yoke of coalition, moving forwards.”She says she wants the public to “realise that the Liberal Democrats are on their side” and fears they don’t instinctively.  She is keen to listen to voters, if elected. “I started my leadership election by touring the country listening to voters not in London in the southeast. And that’s what I would like to spend the first year of my leadership doing. Finding a message that resonates, in all parts of the country, making the case for liberal values.”She opposed Brexit and has called on the government to extend the transition period, amid fears a no-deal exit this December could batter an economy still reeling from the coronavirus crisis. But Lib Dems hoping she will campaign immediately to rejoin the European Union will be disappointed. Instead, she wants the party to focus on three main areas: education the environment and the economy including creating an economy with well-being at its heart. She fears the UK has gone backwards on social mobility, of the kind of which she benefited. “Inequalities have grown to such an extent that basic social mobility, the kind of social mobility that meant my father was the first in his family to go to university and then became an ambassador, just doesn’t exist anymore,” she said.“Young people in this country are deeply frustrated with the way the markets are working ...

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The United States’ coronavirus pandemic  passed another sombre milestone on Wednesday as confirmed cases surpassed two million, according to John Hopkins University data.Five US states - New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Massachusetts - have seen more than 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases each. Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis. Arizona alone has seen, on average, more than 1,000 new cases each day this week. The highest per capita rate in the US. “It’s very clear that it’s a real increase in community spread,” Will Humble, Arizona Public Health Association executive director, told KJZZ in Phoenix. “It’s not some artifact of additional testing.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The “misunderstanding” occurred when Polish soldiers accidentally crossed into the Czech Republic while guarding parts of the border amid lockdowns imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The soldiers then began turning away Czech citizens from a church they were trying to visit in their own country, CNN reported. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Czech foreign ministry said Poland has not formally explained the error but had “unofficially assured us that this incident was merely a misunderstanding caused by the Polish military with no hostile intention”.“The Polish soldiers are no longer present and our citizens can again visit the site freely,” CNN was told by a spokesperson, who did not reveal how long the occupation lasted.

It was corrected immediately and the case was resolved – also by the Czech side.”The accidental invasion was launched from a small border village in southern Poland called Pielgrzymow, which sits opposite Czech countryside. A road there serves as a boundary between the two countries. On Saturday, Poland reopened its borders with the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia for the first time in three months after initially closing them in mid-March in an attempt to slow down the spread of Covid-19. Tight controls on entry remain at its borders with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.In the Czech Republic, the government has implemented a colour-coded system for entry based on the severity of coronavirus outbreaks in relevant countries. Sweden is currently the only European Union state on the list of riskiest “red” countries, a category the UK has also been placed in.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note. Love yourself and, seriously, don’t give a rat’s a what anyone  thinks.Litter – and worse.One green space near me has a sign up saying: “This is a park, not a toilet.”What happened to us during lockdown that we think it is OK to behave like this  Come on, people. We can do better.Having said that, maybe the council needs to put out some more bins.In the Nineties, it seemed barely a day went by without front-page shots of Kate Moss looking worse for wear after a night on the tiles.But those days are gone and there is something strangely comforting about Kate, who is now teetotal, needing to be in bed by pm so she gets her eight hours.Maybe that’s why she still looks so good. She spent years being there and doing that – now it’s time to get her beauty sleep.Not drinking has many benefits. I feel so much better at the end of Dry January than I do end after boozy December. Good for her.It was heartwarming to see Prince Philip in such fine fettle as he turned  last week.I love how dapper he still is. And he has good health, a strong marriage and great wit – le goals for all of us.I do hope he will be celebrating his th birthday – and beyond.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the new book, serialised in the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Mail on Sunday, it is revealed that some lions are deboned while they are still ALIVE because it gives the skeleton a lucrative pink colour – caused by blood being left in the bones. Unfair Game details a covert operation by security services, including ex-British soldiers, to expose the vile industry by using a dealer as an undercover “double agent.” One of the most serious claims by ex-Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is that the lions which are born into captivity are raised in such disgusting conditions that they could spread fatal diseases such as tuberculosis and botulism. Dr Peter Caldwell, a wildle vet in Pretoria, said botulism – an infection which attacks the nervous system – could spread to people through infected bones and skin. He said: “If that lion dies from botulism, the people who bred it won’t waste that animal by burying it or burning it. Instead, they will put it into the lion bone and skin trade. “And the toxin remains in the body, so the people who utilise that lion can die a miserable, painful death.”Other diseases spread by lion bones include brucellosis - an infection that causes arthritis and inflammation of the heart - and tuberculosis, which killed . million people globally in .Another shocking claim in the book is that a rich Russian paid one of the farms to let his bloodthirsty pack of hunting dogs savage one of the caged lions to death. When Lord Ashcroft’s lead investigator, who carried out an eight-month probe, presented his evidence to a South African police chief it was rejected and he was told he was “lucky” he was not in jail. The book estimates there are at least , lions, bred in captivity in South Africa, compared to just , in the wild. Sick farm bosses let wealthy hunters into the enclosures to kill the big cats for sport in so-called “canned hunts” which result in , lion deaths every year. Investigators also found that poachers hunt and kill wild lions in neighbouring Botswana by poisoning or shooting them in the stomachs to protect the precious bones. A lion skeleton is worth up to £,. And in sick markets in Johannesburg, lion bones and skins are sold alongside exotic animals such as pangolins – a creature which has been linked to Covid-.Lord Ashcroft writes: So are we sleep-walking straight into a new major public health crisis with the lion bone industry at its core  I fear we are.

But most schools donapost have the staff or the space and the new guidance comes with no extra money or support.The Labour Party has said the short notice of the announcement will contribute to widespread confusion for schools, pupils and parents.Currently Reception, Year One and Year Six have been brought back in some schools - although others have decided to wait longer. But last week the government was forced to shelve plans for all primary school children toto the classroom before the long summer holiday. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs last week: While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer, we continue to work with the sector on the next steps, where we would like schools that have the capacity to bring back more children - in those smaller class sizes - to do sothey are able to before the summer holidays.  It comes amid concerns that the absence from schools is doing lasting damage to children and their le chances - with the most disadvantaged most at risk. Anne Longfield, the childrenaposs commissioner for England, warned there was a very dangerous threat to the historic right to guaranteed education. She warned that reduced access to education was being allowed to become the default in some schools. The right to education is enshrined in the UNaposs convention on the rights of the child. It has taken  years of campaigning to get children out of the workplace and into the classroom, ensuring that education was a basic right for all children, she told the Observer. We seem for the first time to be prepared to let that start to go into reverse. And I think that is a very, very dangerous place to be. Leading psychologists describe the delay as a national disaster that is putting childrenaposs mental health at risk. Last week, the prime minister promised a massive catch-up operation to help school children who have missed out on education with the details announced this week.  Today Amanda Spielman, Ofsted chief inspector, told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge many schools were being creative to help manage their class sizes. Ms Spielman said schools had been told there is a hierarchy of infection control, with handwashing placed higher than social distancing. She said: Social distancing within the bubbles of the half-size classes is, according to the guidance, an aspiration, not an absolute requirement. Whataposs really important is that everybody works to the guidance as it stands, plans for the relaxations that are likely to come along in future. But, yes, obviously, a reduced distance expectation will flow through into greater capacity in schools but what we need to get to is that plan for how we build capacity over time. Use relaxations as they come through but concentrate on the main objective which should surely be to get as many children back into school as possible and as soon as possible.Labouraposs shadow education secretary Rebecca Long Bailey told Sky News the announcement of new guidelines without clear advance warning could create further uncertainty for schools, pupils and parents.Thereaposs widespread confusion across the sector, and the government so far has failed to build a consensus between school leaders, trade unions, leading experts within the sector around the safety principles that need to be put in place within schools for a safer wider reopening, she told Sky News.Thereaposs a feeling that schools and local authorities have been left to navigate this by themselves, and that should never have been the case.What the government should have done from the start is create a task force to reach a consensus, not only to ensure safety principles were put in place, but also to provide reassurance that it was safe to go back into the classroom, and that didnapost happen. The government has to work very quickly to rebuild trust. Meanwhile leading psychologists describe the delay as a national disaster.that is putting their mental health at risk. In an open letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, they say the isolation of lockdown is harming already vulnerable young people.  "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown changes things you","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdown changes: All the things you can do in England from tomorrowNon-essential shops and zoos reopen from Monday  June - but youll have to wait longer for pubs, cafes and hairdressers.

For the first time in three months youaposll be able to go clothes shopping and see the lemurs. But there will be strict social distancing rules in place and firms will be ordered to carry out more hygiene measures than usual. Expect queues outside shops and high demand for tickets for attractions allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, people who live alone or single parents are allowed to form a bubble with one other household in England. This means breaking the two-metre rule for the first time to hug and kiss, share childcare, stay the night and have sexthataposs your thing. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the lockdown changes this week. Two separate households in England can now join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative. For a full explanation and QA click here. What changes in England from June  Non-essential shops reopen  Non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen for the first time for almost three months in England. Stories will need strict social distancing measures, much like those weaposve already seen in supermarkets and other essential stores. Brands vowing to reopen bang on time from June  include Primark, GAME, Debenhams, O, EE and BT, HM, Lush, GAME, H Samuel and Argos. John Lewis is set to open most stores from June , while Next will open a handful followed by others in the coming weeks. Types of shop allowed to reopen include:Fashion shops Charity shops Betting shops and arcades Tailors, dress fitters and fashion designers Auction houses Antique stores Retail art galleries Photography studios Gt shops and retail spaces in theatres, museums, libraries, heritage sites and tourism sites Mobile phone stores Craft fairsFace coverings will be mandatory on public transport  Everyone travelling on public transport in England will be required to wear a face covering from June . Wearing a face covering - not a surgical mask - will be part of the conditions of carriage for travelling on public transport. That means travellers could be refused permission to board buses or trainsthey refuse to comply with the order. Serious offenders could be fined, but ministers have claimed people will largely comply and this wonapost be needed.  Hospital visitors and staff will need to wear face coverings and masks All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will be required to wear face coverings - while all hospital staff will be required to wear higher-grade, type  or  surgical masks. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemasstart to re-open  Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday. Boris Johnson has said they can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. That means their on-site cafes and restaurants are expected to operate as take-away only. Only outdoor attractions are allowed to reopen, so reptile houses and indoor aquariums will remain closed. Sites will be operating at reduced capacity, and there may be one-way systems in place. And of course, because very few things are likely to be open it will be busy, you should book your ticket online in advance to ensure youaposre not disappointed when you turn up. Churches reopen but only for private prayer  Places of worship reopen in England from June , but only for private prayer and not for services. Iniduals are expected to be able to reflect and pray while adhering to social-distancing rules - but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted. In line with government guidance churches will be expected to be deep-cleaned regularly and should remove shared books from public areas. Churches have been closed since  March, following instructions from the Government. School pupils in Years  and a quarter at a time  Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years  and  from June , but not all students will be allowed toat the same time. Only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time - meaning schools have had to instigate special timetables and classes to make the system work. Secondary schools are not likely to fully reopen until September at the earliest. Students who dowill be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. The teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue until the start of the summer holidays. Some primary schools will open a bit further than they are now While around half of the UKaposs primary schools have been open to more pupils from June , some have remained closed to all but key workersapos kids. This meant nursery, reception, year one and year six pupils in some parts of the country havenapost yet got back into the classroom. Some places, like Doncaster and Liverpool, stopped schools reopening on June , but will see them reopening their doors on Monday. Donapost expect more big changes to primary school attendance before September though. Plans for all pupils in Years , ,  and  tofor a month before the summer break in England have been dropped by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Instead schools are just being asked to bring back whoever they can, depending on capacity. He told MPs he is now aiming to get all children back to school in September,possible. What has already changed in recent weeks in EnglandJune : Primary schools were asked to reopen to years R,  and  in England - though only about half of them actually did June : People allowed to meet in socially-distanced groups of up to  outdoors, including in private gardens June : Car showrooms and outdoor markets allowed to reopen June : Dentists begin to reopen with extra hygiene measures in place June : -day quarantine comes into forced for those arriving in the UK June : Some parking charges that were suspended . What weaposll still need to wait until July for - or longer Pubs, restaurants and bars Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes are not expected to reopen in England until July  at the earliest. They can already operate as takeaways - good news for pubs next to parks or beaches - but they canapost have people drinking on the premises, even in the beer garden. Pubs arenapost guaranteed to reopen on July  - thataposs just the starting date for the hospitality and leisure industry so boozers might come later. When they do open itaposll have to be with social distancing rules in place. Hairdressers and nail bars  Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons are also only opening from July  at the earliest. And like pubs, the date could end up being later because itaposs hard to avoid being in close contact with someone cutting your hair. The two-metre rule Boris Johnson is under pressure to drop the two-metre social distancing rule down to one metre or one and a half. This would increase the risk of catching the virus from someone but allow the economy to restart. The government has made clear that the two-metre rule is still in all its guidance, including draft rules for pubs and cafes to reopen. But that could change in future. Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut the distance but only when itaposs supported by the science. In basic terms, that means waiting until your overall risk from catching the virus in wider society is so low, some extra risk from the person youaposre next to is acceptable. Scientists say youaposre  to  times more at risk from one metre away than two metres away.

It is feared the PM will do everything to avoid it because he knows it will reveal how he mishandled the pandemic. But he has been told lessons from his mistakes must be learnedlives are to be saved in a new peak feared in September. Emma Norris, of the Institute for Government, said: “A rapid review is essential to be better prepared. The Government must learn lessons nowit is to make adjustments and help save lives in the event of a second wave. “This exercise should be launched as soon as possible, reporting by early autumn and sharing findings with the public.” And she says the  should be made up of public health experts, epidemiologists and Whitehall officials, with an independent chair. It would look at PPE failures, test and trace fiasco, care home disasters and how lockdown is being lted. The PM has refused calls for an immediate inquiry, saying although there will be a time to learn lessons he’s been “very proud” of pandemic handling.He also rejected any probe into aide Dominic Cummings who flouted lockdown by driving  miles to Durham. Pandemic predictor Professor Neil Ferguson said the “R” transmission rate needs to be below . to avert a second wave. It currently averages . but the position is “unclear” going forward. That’s why Nightingale hospitals have been put on ice rather than closed down. Professor Ferguson, of Imperial College London, added: “We have a little bit of wiggle room, but it will be a learning experience as to how we allow society to resume while maintaining control of transmission.” An inquiry would also answer the question of whether two-metre social distancing can be reduced to one – a move the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies says is dodgy.  UK chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: “A minute at two metres contact is about the same risk as six seconds at one.” The UK has the second-highest death rate of any major country in the world with  per million of population, behind Belgium’s . Nearly , are known to have been infected and , have died in care homes. By September local authority providers will face a £.billion bill including £billion on PPE, £billion on staff and £million on deep cleaning. But the Government has only provided half the social care funding needed.  The spread of the virus has been blamed on a failure to test early. At the height of the pandemic the UK conducted . tests per , people compared to Italy’s ., Ireland’s  and Germany’s .. Relaxing lockdown rules could prompt a second virus surge by the end of August “that is higher and lasts longer than the first”, says mathematician Dr David Glass, of Ulster University.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here A Government source told the MoS the move to reduce the distance would provide a road map to unlock the economy before the hospitality industry re-opens for business on July . It comes amid fears thatit remains in place, the hospitality sector will be hit by millions of job losses when the governmentaposs furlough payment scheme comes to an end. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, has previously said thatguidelines are not changed, an estimated , pubs and bars will not be able to re-open. It is understood that the review will be run by Downing Street’s newly appointed Permanent Secretary Simon Case. At the moment, Britain and Spain are the only countries in Europe which maintain that people should remain two metres apart to prevent the spread of Covid-. The World Health Organisationrecommends a distance of three feet, or one metre. Until now, Downing Street has emphasised people should still stay two metres from people from outside their household, despite lockdown easing. A Downing Street spokesman said: Our progress in fighting coronavirus depends on everyone following the rules we have set out. This comprehensive review will examine how the two-metre rule works in practice, the scientic evidence and international comparisons, among other factors. It comes after the PM declared earlier this week to put the rule under constant review.  Mr Johnson said: I’ve read many papers actually on the social distancing rule and it’s a very interesting point. I believe that those measures, the two-metre rule, need now to be kept under review. As we drive this disease down, as we get the incidence down, working together, I want to ensure we keep that two metre rule under constant review.

But nurses were the backbone of the NHS long before this pandemic. And not all of these medical angels work in hospitals. Health visitors – those who serve in our communities – are often the unsung heroes of the nursing world. Rachael Hearson, , has been an NHS nurse, midwe and health visitor for over  years – and has experienced all the heartbreaking, hilarious and downright hairy moments that career entails. ‘It’s one of those professions that most people think is a bit of a non-job,’ she explains. ‘People often say, “You just sit on sofas and drink tea, don’t you ” or “It’s not like you’re a real nurse, in the hospital.” Well, let me assure you, we are real nurses! And unlike our amazing colleagues who continue to take the strain in the hospital fraternity, we are out there, on our own.’ It was in July , when Rachael – who came from a poor background – left behind her mum, dad and older sister in Devon, moving to London for £ a month to train as a nurse. ‘Nursing immediately felt right. I had the inclination and aptitude and it provided a salary, which for a working class girl like me was crucial.’ After three years at St Bart’s teaching hospital, Rachael then focused on midwery, learning about breech deliveries, pre-eclampsia and episiotomies .‘I loved the joy of delivering babies. Once you had acclimatised to the blood, heat and the potential drama, it was incredibly rewarding,’ says Rachael. But witnessing a traumatic stillbirth, and having to deliver a grey, leless baby, made Rachael rethink midwery. ‘It was an event that could not be unremembered, it was overwhelmingly sad.’ There was also a very personal reason for deciding to walk away from the maternity wards. Shortly before her training began, Rachael had fallen accidentally pregnant by her boyfriend J. Together they’d made the heartbreaking decision they were too young and too poor to start a family. ‘To be blunt, I’d had a termination and found myself in a surreal world surrounded by babies while tormented by ending my own pregnancy,’ she reveals. ‘It was the right decision at that time, yet there were moments I felt wracked with guilt.’ More happily, Rachael later went on to wed J – an IT project manager – in , and they were blessed with two planned-for and much-loved babies down the line.  In , Rachael honed her nursing skills to specialise in health visitor training at Plymouth Polytechnic. Today, having worked in inner cities as well as more rural locations, she lives in Dorset, where she still thrives as a health visitor. ‘We deal in the full human experience. Our work is mostly behind closed doors yet no less profound,’ insists Rachael, who has privileged access to all families with children under five. ‘Sat on your sofa, we might look as though we’ve never had a real experience in our lives,’ she smiles, wryly. ‘But believe me, we’ve secured more refuge places for those fleeing violence – even helped them pack their bags – and seen more drug-addicted parents with their newborns than you can shake a stick at.’ From asking breast-feeding mums how their nipples are, to sorting emergency contraception and looking for tell-tale signs of postnatal depression or domestic abuse, Rachael’s role is to sensitively see where there is need – and offer her help. Incredibly, one married couple she assisted early on in her career – before the internet came along – needed the facts of le explaining to them. ‘They had been married for some years but children “hadn’t come along”. The GP deduced they didn’t know how to make babies, and it was my job to ensure they did!’ laughs Rachael. ‘They genuinely thought babies arrived as a result of simply ‘being married’ and had no clue. Teaching someone about sex is quite a responsibility. But within a couple of visits, the pair couldn’t keep their hands off each other.’ Sex is an all-prevailing theme in Rachael’s job though, as she points out, ‘babies are the natural consequence after all, so it’s blindingly obvious that sex is going to crop up!’ She’s learned to take all sorts of absurd and surreal scenarios in her stride. Once, she bizarrely endured witnessing a -something dad masturbating on a sofa while she discussed with his girlfriend the sex offenders’ course they were both undertaking.  ‘Her boyfriend was an offender, and she was doing the partners’ course,’ explains Rachael. ‘I was in a conversation with his girlfriend, and there was a new baby to examine, when I noticed some movement out of the corner of my eye. aposThere it was – dear Lord! – the unmistakable rhythmic wrist action, so I turned my back to him. His girlfriend, puzzlingly, did not acknowledge the situation. He carried on as though we weren’t there she carried on as though he wasn’t there I kept calm and just... carried on.’ Rachael even unwittingly visited a brothel once, on a routine assessment of an -month-old child’s development, along with his mother at their home. ‘I was carrying the obligatory scales and assorted toys when I knocked at the door. I was ushered through to the kitchen, where I passed by the parlour room on the left, generally used as a dining room in the other terraced houses on the street. This one, however, was clearly “the boudoir” occupied by a double bed and a couple “at it”.’ Rachael assessed the toddler – who despite clutching a copy of a gentleman’s magazine in his snotty hands – seemed healthy and well developed. ‘We would definitely be viewing things through a dferent lens in today’s climate,’ admits Rachael. ‘But Anthony appeared loved and happy. And I have visited much worse, believe me.’ However, a health visitor’s input is not always welcome. Rachael endured a terrying experience when undertaking a new birth visit to Jean and her new baby Chloe, who were living in a homeless shelter. ‘A huge – and I mean huge – bloke holding a very long kne strode in. I have no idea whether it was a bread kne or a machete – as I was later quizzed about it by the police – but it had a bloody long blade. And he was now holding it up in the air shouting swear words and calling me a b***h.’ Gathering all her wits about her, and mustering a more authoritative voice than she was feeling, Rachael ordered, ‘Right Jean, we’re leaving now. Bring Chloe.’ Mum and baby were moved to safety and the police were called. It’s not all high drama, of course. Much of Rachael’s job is simply fighting for families in poverty – those experiencing problems with claiming benefits, orce, unemployment, eviction, mental health, debt or any combination of these.  ‘The level of real deprivation is staggering,’ she says. ‘For many, it’s not just the lack of a place to call home, it’s the lack of dignity and instability families must endure – imagine you and your family having to share the same kitchen and loo with strangers.’ Handing out vouchers for food banks, making charity applications for white goods, emailing housing departments and lobbying MPs, and sometimes, digging into her own purse is all par for the course. ‘We don’t make a habit of it, butsomeone is in dire need, maybe the cupboards are bare and it’s Christmas, you’d have to be a hard b*****d to walk away.’ In , Rachael undertook a master’s in health policy, planning and financing, believing her future lay in management. But with all her natural warmth, compassion and chalked-up le experience, she soon realised it was too dry for her. ‘After six months I was back, full throttle, to the front line – and it is where I am still privileged to be today.

As soon as her glass was empty, it was whisked away and ed full. She was being thoroughly spoilt by her neighbours. Samantha, , rented a bungalow in the backyard of a home in the suburb of Kangaroo Flat, in Bendigo, Australia, that belonged to Christine Lyons. Christine, , invited Samantha for drinks with Christine’s boyfriend Peter Arthur and their housemate Ronald Lyons, . Ronald and Christine had once been related through marriage – and they’d also dated at one point in the past. But now Christine was with Peter and the unlikely trio lived happily together. It was January  and as Samantha chatted away, drinking from her glass, she felt strangely groggy. Looking around, Samantha felt confused and wary, a feeling that had become increasingly familiar to her over the previous months. She couldn’t quite put her finger on what was going on lately, but she knew for certain that something wasn’t right… Single mum Samantha had moved from Ballarat to Bendigo to start a new le with her four children. She’d had problems with an ex who had been found guilty of assaulting her and she wanted a fresh start. Samantha, who had some learning dficulties, was easily led and considered vulnerable to some, but she was a kind and loving mum to her kids, aged  months, four, five and six. Samantha thought she had found a sanctuary with Christine, who had been generous with her welcome. Christine was unable to have children of her own and seemingly doted on Samantha’s offspring. The truth was Christine was desperate to have kids. She had approached around  people asking themthey would have a baby for her. When trusting Samantha turned up, she saw an opportunity to get the family she desperately wanted. If Samantha were gone, there would be four children who would need a new mum – and Christine was more than happy to step in.  Christine told Peter and Ronald that her friend Samantha ‘had to go’. They hatched a plan to kill Samantha so that Christine could take her children. In January , they invited Samantha over, crushed up drugs and mixed them into her drinks. It was a cocktail of around seven medications, including sedatives, beta-blockers and antihistamines. Some had been prescribed to Christine in the past. Samantha started to feel the effects of the medications, but the combination wasn’t enough to make her fatally ill. Christine grew frustrated and Samantha grew suspicious. Samantha told her brother over the phone that perhaps it was time she moved on. She said that the trio were ‘starting to take over’. Christine had the children in her house more and more – while Samantha felt she was losing control. Impatient Christine told Peter and Ronald that Samantha had to go on a ‘permanent holiday’ and their plan stepped up a gear. On the night of January , or in the early hours of January , Peter attacked Samantha and hit her around the head seven times with a hammer. Samantha didn’t stand a chance and the blows were fatal.  Ronald bought two shovels from a hardware store and helped Peter bury Samantha in a dry creek in bushland south-west of Bendigo. Then the three told everyone that Samantha had ‘run off’ with a man in the middle of the night and had left her kids because she didn’t want them. They said she had started using drugs and had become violent towards her kids. They were terrible lies to discredit her and cover the crime. The last sighting of Samantha was on January  when she was captured on CCTV using a cash point machine. Her disappearance was investigated. Friends, family and even the police didn’t believe that Samantha had left of her own accord. Police put pressure on the three and it was Christine’s boyfriend Peter who would crack after just a few weeks. At first, Peter admitted he had killed Christine and insisted that he’d acted alone. He said that Samantha had lashed out at him and he’d acted in self-defence. He even took officers to where Samantha’s body was buried. But after being charged, he admitted that although he’d been the one who had beaten Samantha to death, Christine and Ronald were all part of the sickening plot.  Peter told them all about the drugs they had spiked Samantha’s drinks with, how Ronald had helped with the plan and that Christine had been the mastermind because of her obsession to become a mum. By now, Christine had changed the names of two of Samantha’s children to the favourite names she’d picked out for her future children – and had enrolled them into a new school. Samantha had family who would eventually take the children in and they were heartbroken that although the youngest were too young to know any dferent, the eldest reacted strongly to their original names being used. In , as part of a plea deal, Peter Arthur pleaded guilty to murder and received  years in prison, with a parole period of just  years. The judge called the crime ‘vicious, calculated and planned’. He said that while Christine had been the architect of the crime, Peter had made a ‘conscious and selfish choice’ to go ahead with the murder because of his ‘foolish and pathetic devotion’ to her. After an appeal by the prosecution, who were unhappy at his vastly discounted sentence, Peter’s sentence was later increased to  years with a parole period of  years. Christine and Ronald went to trial in  and both denied their part in the killing. Peter was the key witness as part of his plea deal and implicated them in the murder.  The prosecution said that the motive was clearly down to Christine. ‘Christine Lyons was unable to bear children herself and she was desperate for children of her own,’ the prosecutor said. ‘She wanted to raise Samantha’s children as her own children.’ The court heard about the plan to drug Samantha and showed evidence that Christine went to her GP to get prescription drugs that she would go on to use. There were text messages between the three accused as well, and everyone knew about Christine’s obsession with having a family. Peter had no reason to kill Samantha. Ronald had been part of the drugging and disposing of the body. He had known what was going on and did nothing to stop it. But the defence said that Peter had been the one who had hammered Samantha to death and had acted alone. They said that Peter’s story had inconsistencies and he’d only blamed Christine and Ronald once he was on remand, simply to get a reduced sentence. The jury disagreed. Christine was found guilty of murder and attempted murder. Ronald was found guilty of attempted murder and assisting an offender but not guilty of murder. At the sentencing, Christine’s lawyer claimed that her below-average intelligence and dficult upbringing should be taken into account. But Samantha’s mum Vivienne gave a statement to remind the court just how horric the crime was. ‘You have stolen the le of my beautul daughter,’ she said. ‘I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to my family… I hope Samantha haunts you until the day you die.’  The judge said that Christine was the architect and was ‘involved in the administration of each stage’. He described the killing of the ‘loving, caring and devoted mother’ as ‘heartless and thoroughly evil’, adding, ’Samantha was vulnerable and, for all intents and purposes, defenceless. You sought to rob an innocent woman of her children so you could take them as your own.’ Christine was sentenced to serve  years with the chance of parole at  years. Ronald was sentenced to  years and six months. He will serve a minimum of nine years. Outside court, Samantha’s brother Michael, who had taken in his sister’s four children, called the sentences ‘ludicrous’. ‘Knowing one of them will be out before the youngest baby actually turns  is very gut-wrenching,’ he said. ‘Definitely I think it should have been le behind bars.’ In March this year, Christine and Ronald Lyons both appealed their sentences. Christine claimed she was ly implicated in the murder. The appeal suggested that Peter Arthur had acted alone, and lawyers said that the conviction was ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ simply based on Peter’s evidence and nothing .

The five-year-old, who lost both his legs as a baby after horric abuse by his birth parents, is walking on his new prosthetic legs and crutches every day this month to reach his target. Tony was  days old when he was admitted to hospital in , so badly injured he was not expected to survive. Medics battled to save him and later amputated both legs below the knee, and adoptive parents Paula and Mark Hudgell were warned he might not crawl, let alone walk. But today, using limbs fitted three months ago, he will have notched up km. He has already raised over £, for Evelina Children’s Hospital in Lambeth, South London – well over his original £ target. Paula said: “When I brought Tony home he was four months old, tiny and withdrawn. He was extremely poorly, his legs in plaster and arms only out of plaster the day before.  Looking at what he’s achieved, you can’t imagine he’s the same child.” Thanking readers for their good wishes, she added: “We’re so thankful for everyone’s love and support. We’ve kept all the messages in a memory box for Tony.” Tony has covered around m a day at a green near his home in Kings Hill, Kent, since June , inspired by ex-Army officer Captain Tom Moore, who raised £million for the NHS walking laps of his garden. Paula said: “We wanted him to have a challenge to seehis prosthetics would work. Since starting, he is stronger and can move so fast.” It has raised hopes that Tony – who also has a dislocated left hip, arthritis and partial deafness from the abuse – might one day walk unsupported.Paula, , and finance worker Mark, , are fighting for a “Tony’s Law” for tougher sentences for cruelty cases, with le terms for perpetrators.

The picture - taken amid violent clashes between far-right protesters and police - has sparked widespread outrage, a campaign to identy the man dubbed an embarrassment to Britain, and calls for him to be sent to prison. It happened as hooligans and far-right groups claimed they were there to protect statues and memorials. An investigation has been launched by the politan Police. MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying after being stabbed to death in the grounds Parliament by Islamist terrorist Khalid Masood in , said the image of the man urinating next to the memorial was abhorrent. The Tory MP for Bournemouth East and chairman of the Defence Select Committee, tweeted a picture of the man and wrote: Absolute shame on this man. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates from the violent clashes in central London. Of all the images to emerge over these few testing days I find this one of most abhorrent. Please help identy him. Mr Ellwood later told Sky News:is an embarrassment to Britain. In an interview with the BBC, he said the man should come forward and apologise, adding that he was disgusted and the image was one of the most disturbing he has seen. Mr Ellwood said: We are going through a very dficult period of self-reflection here, quite rightly for us to look back and have a long overdue debate of our complex past and perhaps be more aware and critical of our own history. He added: But the minority far-right groups wanting to come to London on the pretext of defending monuments, and yet we see monuments such as this being treated in this way, shows how far this generation still has to go.  When asked whether he thought the urinating man may not have noticed the memorial, Mr Ellwood said: I donapost agree with that at all. This is the gates of Westminster, the most iconic symbol of democracy in the world next to a monument for Pc Keith Palmer. He was fully aware of what he was doing, he should step forward and apologise. These images are seen across the world, they will damage Britainaposs reputation. It will make us look like we are not in control. He agreed with the Home Secretaryaposs comments of using the full force of the law against the unruly protesters, adding: We must absolutely be firm on these people who choose to come to London and defend these statues but actually come here on the pretext of attacking the police and pursuing other agendas. Commander Bas Javid, of politan Police, said the force has launched an investigation. He said: “We are aware of a disgusting and abhorrent image circulating on social media of a man appearing to urinate on a memorial to PC Palmer. “I feel for PC Palmer’s family, friends, and colleagues. “We have immediately launched an investigation, and will gather all the evidence available to us and take appropriate action.” The politan Police Federation chairman, Ken Marsh, condemned the disorder and unruliness, and suggested the man pictured urinating next to the memorial should be sent to prison.  He said: Itaposs horrendous. The man urinating next to Keith Palmeraposs memorial is disgusting. A faction of people today [Saturday] only had one intention - to be violent and unlawful, they didnapost come here to protect the statues, itaposs just disorder and unruliness. I suggest serious custodial sentences in relation to assaults on police and others, criminal damage and urinating next to the memorial of heroes. Senior Tory MP Rob Halfon described the behaviour of a protester seen urinating by the memorial to PC Palmer as “horric”.  Mr Halfon, the chair of the Commons Education Committee, said he hoped the perpetrator was tracked down and jailed.  “This is just so horric. I hope they find this inidual and lock them up and throw away the key,” he said. “This is not the kind of country we are. I feel every possible good wish to the family of PC Palmer, who did so much to keep us safe.” More than  people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assaulting police officers possession of an offensive weapon, possession of class A drugs, being drunk and disorderly and breach of the peace, Scotland Yard said. Several hundred demonstrators, mostly white men, attended the protest organised by far-right groups, including Britain First, which claimed they wanted to protect statues such as Winston Churchill from vandalism. But fights erupted in areas near the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square, as demonstrators repeatedly assailed officers with foul-mouthed chants and missiles, smoke grenades and flares. Shards of glass were strewn along the streets close to the Cenotaph on Whitehall after bottles were thrown at police officers clad in riot gear.  The violent scenes are in contrast with peaceful demonstrations that took place at Hyde Park and Marble Arch by anti-racism protesters in support of the Black Lives Mattermovement. On Friday, statues in Parliament Square - including of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi - were boarded up to prevent them being targeted by protesters both from the Black Lives Matter movement and far-right groups. The politan Police warned people joining demonstrations on Saturday that they must be off the streets by pm or risk being arrested. At around pm, the crowd in Parliament Square thinned out after one of the exits was opened, although a few hundred people remained in the area ahead of the pm deadline. The violence has been condemned by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Home Secretary Priti Patel, with the latter branding it as thoroughly unacceptable thuggery.

Dodgy IT systems saw some bankrupted, wrongly jailed and led to one suicide before damages were awarded to subpostmasters accused of theft. But nearly six months after a judge slammed Post Office bosses who covered up the problem leaders say talks aimed at re-setting relations are being evaded. The Communication Workers Union say they are being denied representation during discussions, and fear new CEO Nick Read is planning changes that could see small branches close. Postmasters branch secretary Mark Baker said a rival union, the National Federation of Subpostmasters, continued to be the only recognised body in talks. He said: Weaposve been totally excluded from any negotiations. Weaposve been challenging the CEO on how this fits with the commitment to reset relations with subpostmasters. We, as subpostmasters, have not been able to choose our representative body. They donapost want to speak to anybody who will answer back. Mr Baker said issues with the Horizon IT system still continued, but postmasters were being kept in the dark over what was being done to address these. And he said union members feared improvements were not being made to Horizon because the Post Office was planning to scrap the system and roll out PayZone systems like those found in convenience stores. He said this could herald the closure of branches, with more complicated services related to passports and driving licence applications centralised in cities and large towns.  Convenience stores would be able to offer simple services like postage, meaning increased competition could see small branches close.

The Duke of York, , is hoping he will be able to resume his senior royal duties, according to the Sunday Times. But the Queenaposs patience with her embattled son is aposwearing thinapos after he got himself into yet another public scrap over the FBIaposs investigation into Epstein, a source told the newspaper. Buckingham Palace is aposfuriousapos with the Duke of York after he rowed with US investigators probing the American billionaire, who died in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Courtiers are accusing the dukeaposs statement to investigators who have requested to quiz him of overshadowing his fatheraposs birthday celebrations.  Prince Philipaposs th birthday was hoped to be a positive moment for the troubled monarchy, but it came in the same week Andrew dominated headlines once again as he slammed US investigators. A source close to the duke told the newspaper the duke regretted the fallout over his disastrous interview with the BBCaposs Emily Maitlis. He had described the widely-mocked interview as a apossuccessapos - but is now said to have expressed regret he failed to apologise to Epsteinaposs victims. The Duke has faced humiliation over his response to questions about his links to disgraced Epstein. The Sunday Times reports today he will refuse to co-operate with the request of US investigators that he travel to the States to help with their inquiries until he gets an aposolive branchapos. In the Newsnight interview he denied having sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, now Roberts, on three occasions. Giuffre has claimed in US court she was flown across the world by Epstein, including once, in March , to have sex in London with the prince, who has denied her allegation.  The source told the Sunday Times: I donapost think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret. Prince Andrewaposs handling of the saga was said to have dismayed senior Palace courtiers. They claimed the duke still intended to resume a public role, and viewed his step back from senior duties as a apossabbaticalapos rather than a permanent move. They also claimed the duke is conscious of the effect of the scrutiny on him has had on the royal family, also still reeling from Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs bombshell exit.  But palace officials were said to be fuming anew after he publicly locked horns with the US Department of Justicein a fresh row last week. The DOJ has filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government in a bid to force the prince to supply a statement. He issued a scathing statement through his lawyers claiming he had offered at least three times to speak to US investigators and that they had used his status to gain publicity for their inquiry. The source claimed Palace staff were aposfuriousapos at Andrew, saying he propelled himself back into the public spotlight during the Duke of Edinburghaposs birthday week.

He cradled grandad Pat Evans, , in his dying moments and was praised by a coroner for his “extraordinary courage” in trying to save him. Last year Owen met the Duke of Sussex at the unveiling of a monument to the victims in Birmingham. It was an emotional moment he will never forget. Speaking about it for the first time with mum Suzanne Richards, Owen, now , says: “He gave me some advice. “He said I must talk about what happened. He said he knew personally, because when he lost his mum, he didn’t. It was a bit weird when he said, ‘when my mum was killed’, because she’s not just any mum – she’s Princess Diana. It seemed like he was trying to give some advice rather than have a meaningless conversation.” Owen got chatting to the Prince after giving a speech at the unveiling. He said: “I was nervous but Harry nodded during my speech. Mum and I had a teddy from our charity Smile for Joel – named after my brother – which we gave to him for his we who was pregnant.“I told him I was there when it happened and how I lost my brother, my grandad and my uncle.” Owen’s le changed forever when a celebration trip for finishing his GCSEs turned into a terrying nightmare. He was staying at the five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Port El Kantaoui with Joel, , uncle Adrian Evans, , and grandad Pat. They had nicknamed the trip the Jolly Boys’ Outing – after their favourite episode of sitcom Only Fools and Horses.Owen recalls texting his mum that they had got there safely and next morning the family relaxed by the pool. But less than  hours later crazed gunman Seeddine Rezgui, a -year-old Tunisian student, walked into their lives and opened fire. What followed next still remains a blur. Sports science graduate Owen finds it painful to recall the horrors that unfolded on June , . The four men tried to run inside the hotel complex to escape, but Pat fell over several times.  Owen was hugging his grandad on the floor when he was shot for the first time. Pat said: “He got me.” Owen, who himself was shot in the arm, urged him to play dead but the gunman fired again at Pat, a retired Justice of the Peace. Owen crawled along the floor to find his brother, tipped to be a future Premier League referee, and his uncle, a gas services manager, both leless in pools of blood. Shocked Owen later called mum Suzanne, , from the hospital and blurted out: “They’re all dead.” College lecturer Suzanne, who was at home in Wednesbury, West Mids, said: “All I could hear was screaming after that. Then the line fell silent. My knees buckled and I fell to the floor. My phone started pinging with messages telling me to switch on the news.  “An image of Owen flashed up – he was getting out of an ambulance. I was shaking like a leaf and in deep shock.” Owen, who had been shot in the arm, rang again and said: “I want to come home, Mum.” Suzanne had to break the devastating news to her mum Maureen, . She said: “She was on her knees, heartbroken. I just had to get to Owen. I still had hope the others were alive because you just don’t want to believe it.” Suzanne and a friend boarded a special flight chartered to pick up survivors andthem home – and the pair found they were the only ones aboard. They dashed to the hospital to find Owen on a bed in his swim shorts. Suzanne said: “I wrapped him in a hug and sobbed. I said, ‘I’m here. You’re safe now’. He looked broken.”  When Owen was discharged they were taken to a morgue where they were shown photographs of the victims. Suzanne’s worst fears were confirmed when Joel, Adrian and Pat’s pictures were there. She said: “I kept Owen in the other room, he’d been through enough. Seeing the pictures was horrendous.” A few days later, the three bodies were flown to military base Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. More than , people attended a joint funeral on July . Hundreds of tributes were also left outside Walsall FC’s Bescot Stadium, where the family had season tickets. Owen said: “The funeral was a really dficult day.”  It turned out he passed his GCSEs with flying colours on the same day, Suzanne said: “The three people he wanted to show his grades to weren’t there. They would have been so proud of him.” Owen and his mum had therapy but stopped because the sessions were “like picking at a scab”. They faced further heartache when Maureen died in , having never recovered from the trauma. The beloved family dog Max also died, lost without his owner Pat. But Owen said: “Memories come back every day. The other day I was cleaning my car and I thought of Ade, because we were both mad about cars. “I miss staying up at night watching comedies with Joel, and Mum telling us to be quiet. It’s the little things that hurt. Joel was really into Game of Thrones and I feel sad he didn’t get to see how it ended.

Experts believe that people are less likely to seek care or demand proper personal protective equipment , the BBC reports. The draft report also suggests that occupation could be a factor. Inequality is another likely explanation, the report is said to have found, with disparities in conditions such as diabetes potentially linked to the higher death toll.The BBC reports that stakeholders voiced deep dismay, anger, loss and fear in their communities - because data suggested coronavirus is exacerbating existing inequalities.The report also found that historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work put members of the BAME community at greater risk. It reportedly concludes: The unequal impact of Covid- on BAME communities may be explained by a number of factors ranging from social and economic inequalities, racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and asthma.  Health chiefs have demanded legally-binding health assessments for BAME workers and better data collection around the impact of Covid-. They have also called for messaging about the virus to be more accessible for people who do not speak English as a first language. A PHE review found people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death as people of white British ethnicity.

It came as the latest easing of the social distancing rules in England meant grandparents who live alone can be reunited with their families as they form support bubbles with one other household. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - even staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the previous two-metre social-distancing rule. Five-year-old Heidi, from Worthing, West Sussex, was able to embrace her grandmother who lives alone and can now pair with one other household. Heidi couldnapost contain her excitement as she was finally allowed to cuddle her nan after three months apart.  Her dad Gareth Snow, , filmed the touching moment as the best friends could touch once again after spending months in lockdown due to coronavirus.The sweet video shows Heidi knocking on her grandmother Pamaposs door before backing away to keep her distance. Her dad then asksshe wants to give her nan a hug and she races to the door for a long-awaited embrace. Today we have been able to reunite Nana Pam with her granddaughter and best friend Heidi, Gareth told the PA news agency. It has been a long three months of FaceTime and doorstep hellos at a distance, which has been hard on both of them as they are usually so close. “For those living alone this will make le so much easier – a little bit of ‘normal’. “They can now go for a walk along the seafront, picnic in the park together… Simple things that have sadly not been possible during lockdown.” In Ashtead, Surrey, another grandparent was reunited with her family, including Emily, , Daisy, seven, and Benjamin, four, who had travelled from Bromley to see their grandmother. Gorgeous pictures show the children racing into Susanaposs arms after months apart. Susan, who did not wish to give her second name, is retired and has been knitting jumpers for the trio during lockdown but it was the first time she had seen her grandchildren since March. The new rule, which commenced on Saturday, means adults living alone or a single parent with children under the age of  can be treated as a single household for the purposes of following lockdown rules. There were also squeals of delight in Telford, Shropshire, as another family were finally reunited. Hayley Matthews, , had been separated from her mother Rita Kenyon and said the reunion was like being let out of jail.They had spent a lot of time together before lockdown as both Hayley and her husband Rob work and Rita was the main source of childcare for their children Maddison, nine, Jude, seven and five-year-old Rowan. We have really missed her, especially my youngest, Hayley told the BBC. Rowan spends lot of time with Nanny, so it has been really dficult, the other two understand a bit more. At the first part of lockdown, I wouldnapost go to see her because I couldnapost deal with it. Hayley described the moment they heard the news they were finally allowed to reunite.She said: I rang her because she didnapost watch the news, and she was crying down the phone, it is like being let out of jail were mumaposs words.Announcing the plan for support bubbles earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was a targeted intervention designed to help those most isolated by the lockdown.However, the latest batch of papers released by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesrevealed misgivings among the experts at the prospect of social bubbling. A report of its meeting on May  urged strong caution, warning it could create signicant unwanted effects - particularlyit was introduced alongside other easing of the rules.

For more than  years the South Carolina store sold robes and hosted meetings for white supremacists - including supporters of the American Nazi party. It also sold Confederate memorabilia to sick collectors and was a hub for the KKK, which is responsible for more than  years of racist violence and killings. Now the new owner is fundraising to turn the building in Laurens into a community centre which celebrates ersity. Kindhearted Reverend David Kennedy brought a share in the shop from former Klansman Michael Burden Jr - and after a long legal battle ownership was finally passed to the  The New Beginning Missionary Baptist Church. In an astonishing act of forgiveness Rev Kennedy gave Burden a home, food for his family and a place to worship when he decided to put his former le behind him. Inthe ex-Ku Klux Klan member offered the minister the chance to buy a share of the Redneck Store, which finally closed in , having opened in . The story of Burdenaposs escape from the clutches of the white supremacist group is told in  movie Burden, starring Forrest Whitaker as Rev Kennedy.Back in , Burden said, the Washington Post reported : I want to apologize for causing an eyesore on Laurens.At one point, I believed in this. But it was the wrong belief.A fundraising page calling for the former shop to be turned into a beacon of hope says: Currently, the building sits dilapidated and abandoned, still containing remnants of its past tenant.There are Klan recruitment cards scattered around the main floor, Klan robe order forms still tacked up, and a floor-to-ceiling Swastika mural, left over from the - use of the property by members of the American Nazi Party. These visceral reminders of the building’s not-so-distant past only work to strengthen our resolve to finally create lasting change in Laurens, South Carolina. In place of the far-right meeting place, a new initiative called the Echo Project is being created instead.

Rayshard Brooks died in hospital on Friday night after a scuffle with officers outside a Wendyaposs in Georgia, having allegedly failed a sobriety test and resisting arrest after falling asleep in his car. The -year-old was a father to three girls and also had a stepson, WSB-TV reports. Investigators tonight released footage of the struggle with Atlanta Police that preceded him being shot and killed, which comes only weeks after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. It has sparked fresh demonstrations in the streets of Atlanta, which saw the Wendyaposs where Mr Brooks died lit on fire by protesters on Saturday night.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email  Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames while an anti-racist march has also completely shut down the Interstate  Highway. Mr Floydaposs death has sparked three weeks of widespread protests against racial discrimination, and in some cases violent clashes with police and right-wing counter-protesters, across the US and around the world.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has now launched a probe into Mr Brooksapos death. In a statement given to CNN, it says police were called to the restaurant at around .pm on Friday after a man was found to be asleep in his vehicle, blocking the drive-through lane and forcing other customers to drive around him. The GBI says police then gave Mr Brooks a sobriety test, which he failed, leading to the scuffle.  Attorneys L. Chris Stewart and Justin Miller, who are now representing Mr Brooksapos family, released the images on Saturday night. According to broadcaster CBS, he had spent the evening of his death celebrating his eldest daughteraposs birthday. The fatal shooting led to Atlantaaposs police chief, Erika Shields, resigning on Saturday. Shieldsapos statement said: For more than two decades, I have served alongside some of the finest women and men in the Atlanta Police Department. Out of a deep and abiding love for this City and this department, I offered to step aside as police chief. APD has my full support, and Mayor Bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department. I have faith in the Mayor, and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The Atlanta police involved in the shooting have been criticised for the use of firearms, given that Mr Brooks appears to have only had a Taser. The cityaposs mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: I do not believe that this was a justied use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer. US politician Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia political candidate, is among those who have called for restrictions on police use of deadly force.Commenting on Twitter, she said: A Taser is not a deadly weapon. A gun is. Adrenaline and irritation are not the same as mortal fear. Running away should not be punishable by death. Public safety must mean the public is safe. All of us. And Jen Jordan, a Democratic State Senator for Georgiaaposs th District, wrote: Asleep in his car. Thataposs why police were called. Now he is dead after being shot three times in the back as he was running away. #RayshardBrooksshould not be dead. Authorities have not yet released the names of the two officers, who were both white. A video taken from a nearby car, and released by the GBI, shows Mr Brooks on the ground outside his car, struggling with two officers.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

More details of the competition and the prizes on offer at the bottom of this page.To be clear, features we#ll run on the contenders for Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal, followed by a closing poll to determine the winner, won#t necessarily focus on goals of signicance which have secured silverware or qualication, like John Hewitt#s header in Gothenburg or Darren Mackie#s finish in Dnipro.What we are talking about is goals of technical brilliance, made either inidually or as a team, some of which could be meaningless in terms of competitions and silverware.This pearler from left winger GMS in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup came when the Dons were already - up and cruising against the then-Championship Buddies. The strike also arrived so soon after the start of the second half, some of the ,-strong crowd inside Pittodrie weren#t back in their seats to witness it.However, none of that takes away from a strike which couldn#t have been hit cleaner, nor placed more perfectly into the far postage stamp # despite the fact Mackay-Steven was moving at pace towards the byeline.So good was this hit, it was declared the goal of the round, and this clip to mark the award shows the lasered shot from every glorious angle:After the Scottish Cup win, GMS said: “That was probably the best goal I have scored. I got in front of the defender and just hit it.“From the moment it left my foot I thought it had a chance and it was nice to see it go in the top corner.“It was an important goal as well because - is never a safe result. Going - up made it hard for St Mirren to come back.“That goal was very pleasing as I have not scored many like that.#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition\" title\"#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews help-us-find-the-best-strike-ever-from-a-dandy-don embed # secretngfcQjpJ\" data-secret\"ngfcQjpJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

undertaken by Glasgow Warriorsrsquo professional players.ldquoWhen yoursquore walking in and around Selkirk, you canrsquot help noticing pieces of litter that have been left lying around, often when proper bins arenrsquot that far away, said Nixon.ldquoI thought it would be a good idea for Selkirk players to take a bin bag with them when they head out to take their daily exercise, picking up any litter they see next to paths or along roadside verges.ldquoWersquore lucky in Selkirk to have such unspoilt countryside to exercise in, so itrsquos a shame to see it spoiled by discarded empty bottles, food wrappers and general rubbish.ldquoI kicked off the campaign by nominating three members of our players ndash Aaron McColm, Ewan MacDougall and Liam Cassidy ndash to collect litter on their walks.ldquoEach of this trio will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of Selkirk head coach Scott Wight.He said: ldquoItrsquos another way the club can put something back into the local community, though this time therersquos no sponsorship involved.ldquoItrsquos looking asitrsquos going to be a wee while before any rugby is going to be played, so this latest effort not only helps keep the players in touch with each other, itrsquos also providing a useful service for the Selkirk community.Meanwhile, Selkirk Rugby Club is to stage its annual Players Presentation Night on Fridayndash although this yearrsquos event will be a lsquovirtualrsquo get-together.The plan is for the clubrsquos coaches, players and rugby officials to be digitally linked via Zoom, with Selkirk head coach Scott Wight taking charge of proceedings.ldquoThe idea is to try and stick as closely as possible to the format normally used at the clubrsquos annual presentation nights, said Wight.ldquoA total of nine trophies are up for grabs, and the name of each award winner will be announced separately on the video link, followed by film footage, or photos, of that player in a match situation.ldquoShort addresses will be given by, among others, the clubrsquos chairman and its director of

were introduced last Friday , allowing Scots to meet up with one other household outdoors as long as the total gathering contains no more than eight people and everyone stays two metres

never give up ndash and theyrsquoll crumble one day.This year, though, there will not be a famous face in sight within the walled gardens of Harmony House.With coronavirus restrictions putting paid to any chance of a physical gathering, the showcase ndash which was originally planned for this weekend ndash is set to take a virtual form.Beginning on July , authors will star in events available for streaming from the festival website.Moffat is still in the middle of booking guests, but he has already snapped up some well-known figures, as ever.ldquoIn a way, itrsquos easier for people, he says,

triumph over the obstacles posed by COVID-.But back in March, when the virus began to take hold in Britain, a sense of despondency hung over the group.ldquoWe were absolutely heartbroken, because virtually all of our work had been done by then, says Moffat.As it became clearer that a physical event would not be possible, Moffat and his colleagues realigned their ambitions and channelled their

as Melvyn Bragg or Joanna Lumley or Gordon Brown and being able to ask them questions, says Moffat.,params: .pushThe appeal of the Borders Book Festival, according to its founder, lies in the eventrsquos ldquosociability.ldquoThe famous people are not all herded off into a sealed container ndash theyrsquore there to talk to you, says Moffat.ldquoPeople who are extremely well-known, that all peels away and wersquoll see them standing chatting.Which brings us neatly to comedy twosome Ant and Dec, the showbiz stars whose presence Moffat so dearly craves.ldquoWhat people would see from Ant and Dec is just something completely dferent, he says, admiringly, having known the TV personalities for many years.The pair have a book coming out this year, according to Moffat ndash so perhaps

they worked from home or were furloughed will take part in a public consultation on its vision and embrace the concept of ldquomy space as they move forward.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status it gave the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in their planned revised frameworkwhich is under reviewThe map is part of a wide-ranging consultation which will be launched on the councilrsquos consultation hub on Monday and tackles everything from the environment to travel, leisure and geothermic and renewable energy.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells to look at the latest technology and reducing the town and surrounding areas carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater from the area to create waterways and how they can be used to create geothermic energy projects.Project leader Douglas Proudfoot said the idea behind the new water features across the area was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent. The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido, space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar development in modular manufacture and construction.The council is launching an eight-week consultation on their vision for the area from tomorrow and people will be able to go in and give their views.They are also hoping that as lockdown restrictions ease they may be able to have outdoor exhibitions for people who cannot access the proposals online and will be advertising the consultation

National Development, which will give their proposals support at a national level.The consultation will open at https:eastlothianconsultations  from Monday, June

images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an update in the autumn.The council consultation can be found at eastlothianconsultations"},{"url":null,"title":"work-resumes-offshore-windfarm-neart-na-gaoithe-connections","story":"Neart na Gaoithewindfarm will be

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

She was excited, touched and grateful. We all were, particularly given the identity of the sender. A person who is not flush with the spare time required to put this level of thought into a gt, or a letter.The sender was Nicola Sturgeon.Ms Sturgeon is someone whom Irsquove had occasion to meet, because of my job. And I must say Irsquove always found my private interactions with her to be quite the opposite of the persona which her opponents and some sections of the press advance. I find her warm, open, friendly, interested and engaged. I like her, and I like that I like her, because shersquos my First Minister just as she is everyone rsquos.Now, the purpose of this story is not as a prelude to a column about operations, or books, or children. It is, instead, an introduction to a column about people. People like you and me. People like Nicola Sturgeon and, yes, Boris Johnson too.We would, all of us, do well to remember that our leaders possess all the same human failures and frailties as the rest of us. Millions of us know all about failure and frailty, now. I fear I am comprehensively hopeless as a home teacher. Others are discovering that DIY is not for them. Many are trying and failing to work effectively away from their office.Our own personal failings may not surprise us. Many people will have baked it into  ndash itrsquos a year of treading water and hoping you can hold on.Not so for our leaders. Far from treading water, the national expectation is that they will dominate these choppiest of seas and swim us to a brighter future.Imagine living with this level of responsibility, at this time. And imagine leadership when the tools with which Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson have had to work are so rusty and rotten.Consider first that they were confronted at the outset of the pandemic with two dferent sets of mass death, faced to choose one over the other. One set is obvious ndash those who were about to die from Covid-. This is a large number, originally estimated at around a quarter of a million, but because of lockdown now sitting at a couple of hundred thousand less than that.This imminent death stalked our leaders. The obvious human reaction was to try to save people. They did. But they knew the cost of doing so. Covid kills, but lockdown kills too. It kills more slowly and unpredictably, and indeed in ways that may never be fully understood, but those who die in a year from that undiagnosed cancer, or in five years from the mental ill health into which they slipped, or in  years from the poverty into which they were plunged by unemployment, or in  years from the alcoholism which started during lockdown.Imagine being a leader who has to make this choice.Secondly, it is becoming increasingly obvious that our leaders have been relying on scientic and medical advice which has been, to be charitable, transient. It is, I am sure, frustrating for Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson to hear thatthey had locked down earlier they could have saved lives, particularly so since the people telling them this are the same people whose advice on lockdown timing was followed in March. Equally frustrating is to be ridiculed by the medical community for flirting with a herd immunity strategy when those advancing the strategy in the first place were the leaders of that community.It has become very ldquoon-trend to heap opprobrium on politicians who fail to listen to experts it is less clear how we should judge a politician who listens to experts only to find that those experts have changed their minds. Experts can u-turn with little consequence not so politicians.Imagine being a leader who has to grapple with this.Thirdly, we might do well to think about the personal strain on our leaders. When, reader, did you last have a day off  Are you on one right now  Was it yesterday  Or last weekend  When do you suppose Ms Sturgeon last had a day off  Irsquod guess February.Mr Johnson has had more time off than Ms Sturgeon, but that was to recover from a le-threatening altercation with the coronavirus, for which he can perhaps be forgiven.Imagine being a leader who has an obligation to make decisions which will impact all of us for decades to come, all while yoursquore, for want of a better word, knackered.This is not an appeal for us all to feel sorry for those in power. They chose this le indeed, in the case of both Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon they coveted the job for many years before reaching office.It is an appeal, though, to think of the politicians with whom we disagree as human beings before we enter into a political discourse which opposes or abuses them.I am not comfortable with every decision made by our leaders, and over the summer I expect to find myself shaking and nodding my head in equal measure at the steps they take to remove us from lockdown.However, that is easy for me to do, sitting behind a laptop. And itrsquos easy for opposition politicians, too, knowing that they have no realistic prospect of having to make these decisions themselves.If I could make one appeal to opponents of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson it would be this. Disagree with their actions ndashthatrsquos healthy and indeed in some cases necessary. But think carefully before questioning their motives for taking them.Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson are currently in the midst of the most dficult period of political leadership outside of world wars. Their opponents would do well to recognise that le in opposition is simpler, easier and less consequential than le in government.Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson are the people in the office.

In April the economy was around % smaller than in February.ldquoVirtually all areas of the economy were hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all giving the biggest contributions to this historic fall.ldquoManufacturing and construction also saw signicant falls, with manufacture of cars and housebuilding particularly badly affected.ldquoThe UKrsquos trade with the rest of the world was also badly affected by the pandemic, with large falls in both the import and export of cars, fuels, works of art and clothing.SNP Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said: ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on the economy, businesses and peoplersquos jobs and livelihoods. While the support brought forward by the Treasury so far has been welcome, there is so much more that needs to be donewe are to work towards a strong economic recovery.ldquoThe ONS statistics reveal a record slump of .% in GDP in April due to lockdown measures and the health crisis - worse than during the financial crash. This must serve as a wake-up call for the UK government to immediately extend and strengthen support schemes, not wind them down.ldquoBusinesses are struggling to survive, thousands of jobs are on the line, and households are taking a severe hit as people see a drop in income or job losses through no fault of their own.ldquoThe UK government should be alleviating that financial burden, rather than adding to it at this critical stage.ldquoWith the OECD also highlighting this week that the UK will suffer the worst economic impact of any of the developed countries, itrsquos clear that without immediate Treasury intervention to deliver financial relief and tailored support, our erse sectors and industries - such as manufacturing and agri - face a battle to survive.ldquoThe SNP will continue to pressure the UK government over its coronavirus economic plan - including calling for an extension for as long as is necessary to its Job Retention Scheme and support for the self-employed for the devolved nations."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11296549.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sky-limit-building-new-world","story":"As the coronavirus spread across the globe, and Italy then Spain went into lockdown it became clear to many that the UK might have to follow suit.A few companies saw the signs early and began to make plans for people to work from home with some, like global technology giant CGI, so far ahead of the game that one third of their workforce were already working remotely several weeks before the UK went into lockdown in March.Other industries were not as well prepared, either because of the nature of their work or because they didnrsquot have the means or knowledge to employ remote working.It is now clear that many sectors will be very heavily impacted and unemployment is already spiralling. School pupils, too, have been subject to major disruption and face an uncertain future as jobs and employment prospects disappear.Some workers and pupils, especially those without access to digital technology and skills, will be particularly hard hit and this is why CGI is keen to reach the most vulnerable to help them stay afloat in a post-Covid world.Through their community engagement programme, the company already has a focus on disadvantaged groups and this will continue and be strengthened further over the next year, according to CGIrsquos Director of Corporate Responsibility,Philippa Green.The company has almost , UK staffand she said they were keen to become involved and do what they could to help society recover.Before the pandemic hit, part of CGIrsquos community programme which focuses on supporting the next generation, was working in schools to interest pupils in careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.This work involved hosting STEM camps which engaged students across the UK in fun STEM related activities. The physical camps were cancelled when schools shut their doors but the organisation quickly pivoted and put a version online to help children, parents and schools through the lockdown.ldquoWe started doing it as an immediate response to the situation, said Green.ldquoLike many other people we thought it was going to be a short term project and children would be going back to school fairly quickly but it is now apparent that it is going to be longer than first expected so we are trying to pivot to the next stage.The content will remain online but unfortunately may not be of much use to pupils without a good digital connection or devices at home.Educationalists have already raised fears that this group of already disadvantaged children will suffer most because of the lockdown and CGI is keen to see how it can help reach them.ldquoMany children will not have been in school for six months which is a very long time. For youngsters thatrsquos a letime! said Green.CGI supports many organisations working with vulnerable and disadvantaged children and is working with them to reach those who do not have access to technology.The physical camps had often been targeted at the most vulnerable children in society and one of the companyrsquos last events in Glasgow was in a special educational needs school.One of the other aspects of the companyrsquos community programme is mentoring, when members go into an event in school to give older children career advice and an idea of what working le is like.ldquoTheir parents and their grandparents may not have worked and so the children may not have any idea about working le, said Green. ldquoEvents have been successful but we would normally do that in a school setting in a hall where our members can have one to one chats with pupils and that is obviously tricky to do at the moment.The company has started to record career mentoring videos to support some community groups.In the meantime there are still some new STEM from Home themes to come online before July and these will be released weekly until the end of June.Another group at the front of minds at CGI are those currently working through CGIrsquos graduate apprenticeships at Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Napier Universities. ldquoWe are clear that these iniduals are key to the future of our business says Green.ldquoMark East and Maria Whittingham in our student recruitment team are working hard to ensure they have practical support whilst also thinking about the solutions for future student recruitment at this very important stage in their careers.Elsewhere, CGI, which supports The Glasgow Timesrsquo Streets Ahead initiative, continues to encourage its members to fundraise, with efforts being moved online. Members are asked to nominate regional charities for the companyrsquos charities fund whilst in recent weeks they have been at work fundraising for a foodbank to help those people hardest hit.Members also still have the opportunity to nominate local community sports teams for kit sponsorship.It is hoped this will come into its own as group physical exercise is increasingly encouraged and people get the chance to re-establish important bonds.RETRAINING WILL ENSURE NO-ONE IF LEFT BEHINDCGI has been in a better position than many companies to weather the pandemic lockdown and, as a result, is keen to help society recover post-Covid.ldquoIn February the world changed but some communities and industries are more impacted than others so it feels a bit remiss not to refocus our efforts for these areas in particular, said the companyrsquos Vice President Lindsay McGranaghan for Scotland.An important part of CGIrsquos work is its community programme and the company is now looking at how it can help communities and schools post-Covid.ldquoWe do a number of things around community benefit but we may have to rethink what we have been doing historically and tailor some of that to meet the impact of Covid, said McGranaghan.ldquoWe need to think about who is going to be most hard hit by the pandemic from an education perspective and whether we tailor our work to be more focused on the vulnerable children, as well as the industries impacted such as those where there have been quite heavy redundancies.Technology and technological skills have proved to be an immense boon during the pandemic lockdown and it is quickly becoming apparent that those who do not have access to technology, or know how to use it properly, are at a distinct disadvantage in the st century.McGranaghan feels that as a technology company, CGI is well placed to help both children and workers without these skills and could help retrain those in danger of being left behind.The company has already been working with the Wise Group in Glasgow to help retrain long term unemployed people in IT skills and is now wonderingthis could be extended to impacted industries and newly unemployed people.ldquoWe are looking at things like retraining opportunities, she said.ldquoWe have been reasonably resilient in the technology industry during Covid just because of the nature of the work we do and the question is whether we could put out a hand to dferent industries during what is going to be a dficult time ldquoWe want to look at how we can do this through our community programme.ldquoI think there is something there not only in terms of supporting the local authorities that we already work with, but also how we help with the recovery process.ldquoGiving back to the local community is very importantto us."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-yes-movement-needs-new-prospectus-plan-b","story":"Amidst mass fatalities and economic ruin, it turns out that what Scotland really needs is yet another crack at formulating a lsquoPlan Brsquo to Indyref.Therersquos tone deaf, and therersquos this.Little wonder that when she was asked about it on Newsnight on Wednesday, the First Minister seemed almost allergic to the issue.ldquoFor me, everything other than coronavirus right now is on hold.

She had been training in Perthshire as an eventer when the pandemic hit but ed to help, packing fish and making deliveries, after first attending to her horse early each morning.Said Shirley: ldquoHenri was learning the business buying fish at Peterhead market every day but is now factory based in Aberdeen since Covid and although we had a website set up for ExpressFreshFish - ExpressFreshFish -we had no carriers and no process set up in the factory.ldquoIn the beginning we were just getting one or two orders every couple of days but we kept working at it because it was a focus.However, after making the decision to keep going, the fishing boats tied up but Andrew continued to drive to Peterhead at am every morning to seeanything had been landed.Once the boats stopped going out, the businessrsquos regular transport companies, who would normally take the fish from Peterhead to Aberdeen, decided to furlough their staff which meant even more problems for J Charles.ldquoIt really has been tough but we have just all had to work together, said Shirley. ldquoNormally I would just work in the office a couple of days a week but now Irsquom packing fish in the factory and making deliveries.Fortunately the boats started going out again and the transport companies restarted after a three week break.Due to concerns about quality, the family made deliveries themselves with Henri at one point making a three hour round trip to Ballater to deliver two haddock to an elderly customer.At the same time standards had to be maintained in the factory, while increasing hygiene measures and maintaining social distancing.ldquoThe staff have been brilliant, said Andrew. ldquoIn spite of alarming publicity all our staff, led by office manager Sarah and factory manager Jim, continued to work through this dark time with little time off. The importance of food workers was not supported at the start of Covid which made it dficult for factories like ours to remain open.Although it has had a slow start, the online service has given the family and staff a focus and now orders are coming in from as far away as the south of England including, perhaps surprisingly, other fishing towns like Portsmouth.Repeat orders from satisfied customers are common, with many buying in bulk in order to freeze supplies.Popular items are haddock, both smoked and fresh, cod, lemon sole and scallops and, as there is currently no continental market for Scottish produce, high end items like lobsters and langoustines have been added to the lines.Sustainability as well as freshness is a priority for the company.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of supplying quality Scottish fish to our customers is knowing the product comes from well-managed, sustainable fisheries, said Henri.ldquoJ Charles promotes all Scottish caught fish species as being sustainable and all customers who eat Scottish fish can do so with confidence it is coming from a rich abundant healthy fishery.ldquoOur aim is to make available to our customers top quality fresh Scottish sustainable fish landed by our Scottish fishermen.Supporting local charities is a key feature of J Charles and, as well as donating % of any online orders marked CWT to medical charity Camphill Wellbeing Trust, there is % off purchases from NHS and care workers.ExpressFreshFish also has a Facebook page which carries fish recipes and tips on how to best cook their products."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-black-lives-really-matter-need-go-beyond-knocking-old-statues","story":"Thus, the sight of Black Lives Matter protesters toppling the statue of an old slave trader in Bristol and threatening to remove Henry Dundas, who played a key role in delaying the abolition of the slave trade for  years in , from his perch high above Edinburgh city centre and others of his ilk elicits a suite of predictable responses.

This is merely a rather more visceral rendition of what governments and universities do routinely when they remove degrees and honours from figures who fall from grace. Viewed purely from an artistic perspective many of these old statues are of limited aesthetic value anyway and Irsquod be inclined to remove most of them on those grounds and replace them with something more vivid and edgy that honours the nobility of lesser realms. Stick the old slave-owners in a museum and let their mass defenestration be regarded as a moment in history of itself.What is more important here, I think is this historic opportunity of pulling down the much more insidious and less visible structures which permit racism and racial discrimination to flourish in the long term. I was moved by Anas Sarwarrsquos speech on Thursday at Holyrood in which he starkly outlined our casual indference to racial inequality in civic Scotland.Purely in the political realm I have been disobliging of Mr Sarwarrsquos machinations and stratagems in seeking to shape the Labour Party in Scotland. But there was no doubting his passion on this occasion as he took us through the myriad executive positions in Scotland by which civic influence is wielded and told us they were the exclusive preserve of whites. Scotland and Glasgow in particular is home to a prominent, well-educated Asian community who have contributed greatly to the economy and culture of our nation ndash Mr Sarwar himself is a gted son of this group.Yet, in  smart, erse and inclusive Scotland doesnrsquot trust any of them to be major decision-makers in the civic boardroom cliques which determine future strategies in education, health and the arts. Therersquos little point in posting pictures on Facebook of your presence at a Black Lives Matter demonstration and the harrowing of the nationrsquos rogue statuaryyoursquore not shamed and embarrassed by such civic and cultural apartheid.In September,  Glasgow University published a report of how it had benefited directly from the Atlantic and Caribbean slave trade. The figure of poundm emerged but it admitted that this was probably incomplete, so sinewy and deep-rooted were the routes and means of profiteering from slavery. Itrsquos inconceivable that other Scottish academic institutions, venerable trades houses, finance firms and family fortunes have not similarly benefited from the routine torture, rape and murder of millions of black people.Nor was this confined to the actions of a few old merchants whose stone effigies are currently looking a bit precarious. In a book of essays published in  called Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, Professor Sir Tom Devine and a group of his fellow academics outlined the extent to which almost the entire economy of Scotland in the th and th centuries was under-written by profits from the Caribbean slave markets.:Black Lives Matter: Every Scottish street linked to slave-trade revealedIn his concluding essay, Sir Tom wrote: ldquoThe funds which helped to lubricate the Chesapeake trade were drawn from Scottish landowners, trustees, tradesmen, physicians, military officers, spinsters, widows and university professors, among many others. That also meant the profits of the slave-trade tobacco business were widely distributed through these financial networks well beyond the ranks of the active merchant community itself.Perhaps itrsquos reasonable to question how far back we need to go and whether the raking of ancient ashes can achieve anything. Yet, no-one is proposing punitive land and property-grabs or to impoverish those whose present fortunes are directly descended from racist genocide. Itrsquos surely also reasonable to encourage these families, firms and trades bodies to make a similar audit of their slavery-derived fortunes. Like Glasgow University they could make proportionate reparation with endowments and scholarships for the descendants of those whose suffering once fed and watered the entire Scottish nation.When the Labour Party began to introduce all-women, constituency short-lists they were criticised for endorsing the sort of discrimination they purported to revile. Yet, such a response failed to acknowledge that centuries of male privilege saw many men being promoted and honoured merely by their membership of exclusively all-male golf clubs and masonic lodges. A similar programme of positive discrimination in favour of our Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities is clearly requiredScotland seeks to become a truly inclusive and erse nation.Andblack lives really matter then our response has to be much more profound and long-lasting than knocking down a few old statues.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Itrsquos hoped that Lugi ndash The Brodgar Boy could eventually become a major cinema release, helping to spotlight Orkney and, indeed, Scotlandrsquos often overlooked Neolithic history, echoing the impact of Pixarrsquos  animation Brave, and boosting tourism across the islands. The feature- film will tell the story of a disabled boy who must unite his peoplethey are to defeat evil forces, and is expected to take viewers on an animated tour of the Orkney Islandsrsquo most precious heritage sites. The idea originated from Orcadian illustrator and cartoonist Alex Leonard who has been developing the film with Belfast-based animation company ALT Animation. It recently beat competition from almost  filmmakers in  countries to secure major development funding from Creative Europe. ALT Animation has also received support from Northern Ireland Screen. Intended as a family-friendly movie, the story will use the boy herorsquos adventures to explore some of the mysteries surrounding Orkneyrsquos most ancient monuments, such as the famous settlement of Skara Brae and the Ring Of Brodgar. The sites predate Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Egypt, prompting suggestions that the islands were the epicentre of human existence , years ago. Although strictly fiction, it will be woven around real archaeological evidence and understanding gleaned during excavation of the sites. Some early illustrations have been based on Structure Ten at the Ness, thought to be one of the largest stone-built Neolithic structures in Britain and built around BC.Measuring ft by ft, archaeologists believe it was abandoned around BC, when hundreds of cattle were slaughtered and consumed during a huge feast. Leonard, who lives in Sandwick, was inspired to create the character and dramatic backdrop to the story after visiting the Ness of Brodgar settlement in  and being astounded by its size and history. ldquoI couldnrsquot really grasp fully the scale of what they are finding in terms of the number of buildings and the size of them. I was captivated and couldnrsquot understand why more people didnrsquot know about it, he said. ldquoI kept wondering what it looked like when Ness was in its prime. I went home and started to draw and sketch ideas. ldquoIt was a labour of love that at first I thought could make a little kidsrsquo book.The idea attracted the attention of Tim Bryans, writer and producer from Belfast-based ALT Animation, which has now secured interest from a number of award-winning studios around Europe keen to work collectively on the project.Leonard said the focus is now oncreating a screenplay and a trailer that showcases the story, and looking for a partner to take the film to full production. ldquoWe would love to think that it would eventually go on general release, added Leonard. ldquoWe donrsquot know who will come on board and donrsquot know yetit will be computer generation, D, an arthouse project or have much wider appeal. We are just happy for it to have found its feet.ldquoOur inspiration is Pixarrsquos Brave which did so well for tourism in Scotland.Brave, which told the story of an adventurous princess and featured the voice of Billy Connolly and Kelly Macdonald, was a global hit and resulted in tourism agency VisitScotland spending pound million on the joint marketing campaign with Disney.

Edinburgh City Council is to consider a plan to rededicate the statue to those who continued to suffer enslavement during this period.Across the world other statues have been targeted in the wake of international protests about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago. In Bristol last Sunday, a statue of the th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, was felled by protesters and flung into the harbour.Devine insisted that focusing merely on statues and other artefacts from the past was misplaced. ldquoIf people want to talk about Scottish involvement in slavery they need to be aware of the full picture. In the th and early-th centuries the Scottish nation as a whole was lsquocomplicitrsquo in slavery. The markets and financial s from lsquothe nefarious businessrsquo helped to lay the foundation for modern Scotland and shaped the economy from which we now benefit.In , Devine edited a collection of essays about Scotlandrsquos historic involvement in the slave plantations. Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past demonstrated how all levels of Scottish society, from the early-th century to the end of slavery in the British Empire, were directly or indirectly affected.:Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: The brutal truth about Scotlands slaving pastldquoThe new research showed that merely concentrating on prominent mercantile figures fails to take account of the fact that Scottish society as a whole benefited from chattel slavery: weavers of lsquoslave clothrsquo for the West Indies fishermen who exported dried fish to feed the slaves workers in the mills who processed the raw cotton harvested by slave labour the crews of the vessels who sailed across the Atlantic and the officials, lawyers and clergymen who administered the slave colonies and the spiritual needs of their owners.ldquoOnly by acknowledging the full extent of this nationrsquos role in slavery can we begin to construct a meaningful programme of response today to that dark period of history.lsquorsquoI am convinced that the evidence we now have suggests Scottish modernisation was even more dependent on the slavery factor than England. This was not because of involvement in the slave trade itself. Ships from Scottish ports rarely took part in that horrible commerce in human beings after . Rather it was based on the overwhelming place of tobacco, sugar and then cotton in Scottish external trade. The remarkable boom in these commodities depended entirely on armies of black slave labourers.In , Glasgow University published a report, based on more than two years of research, that revealed it benefited directly from the slave trade in Africa and the Caribbean in the th and th centuries. Its audit put the figure at pound million in todayrsquos money. Following this the university launched a wide-ranging ldquoreparative justice programme to include the creation of a centre for the study of slavery and to establish ties with the University of the West Indies.The study also raised questions about how the wealth of Glasgow and other parts of Scotland was accumulated. Devine praised the universityrsquos research and openness. ldquoThe research confirms that manmore Scots gained from the colonial trades based on slave labour than the tobacco lords and sugar princes who are now attracting such virulent media and political condemnation, he said.:Hundreds turn out lsquoto protectrsquo Glasgow war memorialldquoTherefore, it follows that today there must be institutions and families with links to those times and who prospered from the profits of chattel slavery. But so far, in Scotland, only the University of Glasgow has admitted how it benefited and how it intends to proceed by way of some form of recompense to the people of the West Indies. Why are others silent ldquoOne positive consequence of the current furore has been the triggering of a deeper awareness of the inequalities that black people in Britain and the US continue to encounter to this day and which have undeniable connections to slavery. ldquoYet in order to begin to heal that wound in Scotland, a soundly-based and open knowledge of the nationrsquos central part in slave history is an essential precondition."},{"url":null,"title":"jatin-haria-assume-infected-racism---vaccine-available","story":"The Parliamentrsquos official position now includes the statement ldquothat there is a responsibility on us all to identy and dismantle barriers of structural racism that exist in our society and institutions.It might not seem it, but itrsquos a huge milestone for Scotland.Until recentlythe general line was that Scotland was exceptional, and ldquoitrsquos not all bad here.Wersquore really all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns, we donrsquot have a class system, we only played a bit part in the Empire, we were ardent abolitionists, ordinary Scots didnrsquot see a single shilling of the money earned from the backsof enslaved Africans, we awarded Nelson Mandela the freedom of the city, we welcome immigrants.Exceptional, exceptional, exceptional.One or two of these points are indeed true.

It comes as no surprise then that a third of all black minority ethnic people in Scotland report having experienced discrimination in the past two years.BME people are twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts and, not coincidentally, inequality and discrimination persist in the labour market.Research shows someone with a non-British sounding name has to send nine times more applications in order to receive an interview. Public bodies try to get around this using ldquoname blind application processes, yet the Scottish Governmentrsquos own workforce data shows ethnic disparities of Ben Nevis proportions.Even more worrying was the data showing that between  and ,  murders with a known or suspected racist element were recorded, with many having littleany media interest.All too often these were seen as ldquoone-off incidents rather than any broader reflection on Scottish society. Yet during this period, these  cases gave Scotland a higher per-capita rate of murder associated with racism than England or Wales.In the last Social Attitudes Survey to look at discrimination, % of people in Scotland felt that there was sometimes a good reason to be prejudiced against certain groups.Thatrsquos more than one in every five of us.

We knew wersquod got into oil but we didnrsquot quite realise how big it was.But while BP had pinpointed the UKrsquos largest oilfield ndash quickly followed by Shellrsquos Brent ndash it would be Denver-based Hamilton Brothers, working on Argyll, km southeast of Aberdeen, that would win the race to bring oil ashore.Using a floating, semi-submersible drilling rig, the Transworld , modied to operate as a production , oil was pumped onto the ,-ton tanker Theogennitor.Within a week, on June , , the then energy minister Tony Benn was on board a hydrofoil at Tower Pier in London, heading down river to BPrsquos Isle of Grain refinery in the Medway Estuary to greet the tanker and its valuable cargo.ldquoI hold the future of Britain in my hand, he declared, clutching a bottle of the tankerrsquos crude oil aloft, adding that Britain was set to be one of the worldrsquos  great oil-producing nations.Before long, BP would be bringing its own oil ashore.In November , the Queen pressed a gold button to mark the opening of a pipeline at Cruden Bay which could whisk up to , barrels of BP oil on a -mile journey to the refinery at Grangemouth.Soon the black river was in full flow. By , Forties fieldrsquos four pound million BP rigs had produced . million tons of oil andhelped ensure Britain was no longer at the mercy of Opec oil prices.Within a decade, . million barrels of oil per day were being extracted from  North Sea fields across more than  installations.As more companies raced to take out leases to extract oil, terminals were built in Orkney and Shetland. Sullom Voe alone brought work for  people while Aberdeen shted attention from fishing to became Europersquos Klondike.Family businesses built on cod and herring switched to oil. The most successful, run by Sir Ian Wood, would become a multinational oil services company helping him towards an estimated net worth today of . billion.Aberdeen, meanwhile, boomed and losses felt by drting tourism and cod wars were offset by rich oilmen with very deep pockets.All of which couldnrsquot have come at a better time, as traditional industries across the UK collapsed, coal mines and shipyards closed, and car production ground to a halt.By the mid-s, the North Sea was providing % of the Treasuryrsquos revenues, enabling Conservative government tax cuts, covering the costs of unemployment, and paying off a historic balance of payments problem.And it provided a cushion for Margaret Thatcher to carry out sweeping industrial reforms while funding a consumer boom when, some argue, the income should instead have been invested in a Norwegian-style oil fund.While the SNP continued to declare it was Scotlandrsquos oil, the North Sea was, according to Tony Blair in , ldquoutterly essential to Mrs Thatcherrsquos electoral success.Few working offshore would have complained too much. Their  days on, five days off routine brought extremely good pay: the average salary within the oil and gas sector in  was pound, a year.But there was also constant danger. In the early days, workers were transported in helicopters without wearing harnesses, puffing on fags as they went. If weather grounded flights, some would be ferried from boats to rigs, clinging on to ropes high above crashing waves.Concerns that safety was not a high priority seemed validated in  by the Piper Alpha disaster which claimed the lives of  men and prompted improved health and safety measures. Helicopter crashes also brought tragedy to the sector.But still the black gold flowed. By the early s, the Forties field alone had delivered over two billion barrels of oil, while oil gushed from the North Sea at the equivalent of . million barrels every day, supporting , jobs across the UK.No-one can really know what would have happenedwe hadnrsquot found oil on our doorstep whether we would have been forced to innovate and find new, cleaner methods of providing energy earlier, embraced windfarms and electric vehicles sooner, or limped into economic catastrophe.However, itrsquos clear that a sector that is worth around poundbn to the economy, which supports around , jobs across the UK ndash % of them in Scotland ndash and has paid poundbn in production tax since the s, is changing.Ross Dornan, OGUKrsquos market intelligence manager, said: ldquoThe opening of the UKrsquos first oil pipeline serving the iconic Forties field was a major milestone in our industryrsquos history and a testament to the importance of North Sea oil to the UK economy which remains the case today.ldquoThe industry has gone on to make a hugely positive impact across the UK ndash producing more than  billion barrels of oil and gas, contributing hundreds of billions of pounds to the UK economy and supporting hundreds of thousands of high value jobs.ldquoToday, although the industry is facing some of its most dficult challenges, there is still signicant potential to be realised from the UK Continental Shelf.ldquoOur focus is on driving the recovery of our industry so we can make the most of future opportunities including our contribution to delivering energy security and playing a key role in the transition to a low carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  One Glasgow boy ran to tell the farmer    39 they coos are eating a    your grass  39 ","story":"With falling temperatures, the village moved back indoors. Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow.

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow.

The outbreak has devastated the economy with unemployment rising by over  million in a matter of weeks.Add to this the growing racial turmoil, civil unrest and an incumbent authoritarian president willing to deploy whatever nefarious means necessary to avoid electoral defeat, and all the components exist for a US election facing unparalleled risks to its conduct and integrity.:Rayshard Brooks: Atlanta police officer sacked after fatal shooting of black manHow telling it is about the mood in America right now that just a few days ago, Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, warned that he could foresee a scenario whereby the military would intervene should President Donald Trump refuse to relinquish power following a defeat in Novemberrsquos election.ldquoI am absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch, Biden warned, speaking on the US talk-news programme The Daily Show, adding that his single greatest concern is that the president will ldquotry to steal this election.How telling it is too of the prevailing polarised political mood that Trump has decided to hold his first re-election campaign rally for several months on the date that African-Americans celebrate the end of slavery.Just as that date, June , traditionally known as ldquoJuneteenth is especially signicant, so too is Trumprsquos choice of the city ndash Tulsa in Oklahoma. For it was there, in May and June , that a white mob attacked the prosperous black neighbourhood of Greenwood, known as the ldquoBlack Wall Street, with guns and explosives, killing up to  people and destroying about , businesses and homes.Unsurprisingly, given recent protests against racist violence in the country triggered by the police killing of George Floyd, Trumprsquos move is recognised by many Americans as being the provocation it undoubtedly is.ldquoThis isnrsquot just a wink to white supremacists ndash hersquos throwing them a welcome party, tweeted former Democratic presidential candidate senator Kamala Harris of Calornia in response to the rally.Two of Americarsquos leading newspapers echoed Harrisrsquos reaction, with both The New York Times and The Washington Post calling Trumprsquos decision ldquoracially motivated trolling and timing akin to ldquoblasphemy.If recent opinion polls are anything to go by then many more ordinary Americans too appear exasperated and angry over the presidentrsquos recent conduct. As Trumprsquos campaign team are well aware the latest polling figures are not good.According to the polling data aggregator RealClearPolitics , Trumprsquos job approval rating is down now to %, as low as itrsquos been since last year. And matched against Biden, Trump trails by an average of eight points.In the case of one poll in the aggregator, Gallup, his support was down a staggering  points to % over the last month with Biden leading him by an average of  points among registered voters nationally.In the key battleground states itrsquos the same story, with the RCP average showing Biden tied with Trump in North Carolina, up by three points in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and up by seven in Michigan.Even Georgia appears to be a dead heat. Last weekrsquos primary election chaos there, hampered by ballot shortages and mechanical mals that saw voters waiting for hours in largely minority areas, also served as warning for the perils states face come November. Itrsquos precisely that kind of chaos that Trumprsquos campaign will doubtless use to its advantage.Right now, however, it is only in Texas that Trump has a very narrow lead, a state that has not voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter won the White House in . Inidual polls also provide little comfort to the president, showing that Biden has signicantly bigger swing state margins.Even traditional on-message Republican pundits see the writing on the wall, while doing their best to sweeten what is a very bitter polling pill.ldquoItrsquos not that Joe Biden is doing great. He isnrsquot ndash itrsquos that swing voters have been watching and listening to the president, and a lot of them donrsquot like what theyrsquore hearing, insisted Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, speaking to the Financial Times last week.:Donald Trump tweets bizarre edited clip of himself giving Independence Day speechThat Trump is unhappy with current polls goes without saying, but especially so when it comes to the result of one conducted by CNN, the media broadcaster he has long despised.CNNrsquos results showed the president trailing Biden by a scarcely believable  points. It so incensed Trump that he ordered his campaign team to fire off a near farcical cease-and-desist letter to the broadcaster demanding that it retract and apologise for the poll.Itrsquos all a far cry from earlier this year when Trump was riding higher on a strong economy and soaring stock market following his impeachment trial acquittal.ldquoThis is what can happen when one is in the bunker, Doug Heye, a Republican strategist told the Financial Times, adding that it was a ldquoclassic example of staff impressing a boss by ldquofighting for him despite no chance of success.While the polls now suggest the president is in a perilous position, Donald Trump, of course, is no stranger to political crisis, and he did famously win the  election in the face of it.Certainly,the election were to be held tomorrow, Trump would most likely not survive. But itrsquos not being held tomorrow. November  is still five months away, and  has been nothingnot a complete political roller-coaster in the US so far, with who knows what political surprises potentially still in the offing.Polls, as we all know, are only snapshots of current moods and trends, and not predictions of election results. Despite everything seemingly railed against him, events may somehow benefit Trump. It could be that his handling of the next five months wins people back and even some over to his side, or that the disproportionate Electoral College and voter suppression, or some combination of the two, puts him back in the White House for four more years.If Trump is good at one thing, itrsquos turning a situation on its head to his advantage. The country might be in chaos ndash in great part of Trumprsquos own making ndash but the president will undoubtedly harness this. The obvious place for him to start is by using the recent violence and unrest to campaign on a law-and-order ticket.Exploring the current situation in an article for Al Jazeera last week, the American journalist Scott Norvell highlighted a historical parallel from  when Republican Richard Nixon summoned his ldquosilent majority to the polls and ended up winning the US presidency, despite being challenged from the right by segregationist George Wallace.As Norvell pointed out, academic research published in the aftermath of the  election ldquofound convincing evidence that the widespread violent unrest that year ndash arguably the most tumultuous year of the past five decades before  came along ndash steered US voters into the Republican camp and tipped the election in Nixonrsquos favour.Other America watchers, including the Economist last week, have also made the case that history suggests ldquoRepublicans benefit from street violence, whereas Democrats gain from peaceful protests.But in the wake of the latest protests a Washington Post-Schar School poll has also provided evidence suggesting the contrary, with most US voters supporting the protests and believing the police are in need of reform.Such findings, of course, will not stop Trump in his struggle to regain the campaigning initiative, by reverting to the ldquolaw and order line he used in  and the  midterm elections.This time, however, instead of exaggerated dire warnings about Mexican ldquorapists and migrant ldquocaravans he is rallying his core supporters. some of whom are from the far right, using largely baseless claims about violent, anti-fascist protesters destroying America. That much was evident in a tweet he made last week saying that ldquothese ugly Anarchists must be stooped .Given Trumprsquos record of ignoring or dismissing the restraints built into the American political system, there are a number of options at his disposal should he decide to upend the election. He could, for example, declare a national emergency on the grounds of national security.He has, after all, more than  statutory emergency powers in his political arsenal, according to the law and public policy institute the Brennan Centre for Justice in New York. In practice, there are few restrictions in place to prevent him using them.Speaking to Vanity Fair magazine this month, Cornell Belcher, a strategist and pollster on both of Obamarsquos successful White House runs, warned of the role fear could play in helping Trump with his election campaign over the next five months.ldquoThere is perhaps nothing as powerful, historically, in American politics as fear, Belcher said.ldquoClearly Trump is trying to make Middle American white people terried of the black and brown hordes. If hersquos winning , % of the white vote he can pull the exact same inside straight as he did in , Belcher added, before positing the crucial question.ldquoWill Americans be more fearful of these young people in the streets demanding justice, or of four more years of Donald Trump Should the latter prove to be the case, then the biggest concern of many political observers is that the battle iding America might still not be over as far as the president is concerned.\"Herersquos the real DangerDonald Trump loses the  election\", ran the headline of an article on the CNN website last Thursday. Picking up on Trumprsquos long history of refusing to ever acknowledge defeat, and instead claiming he was cheated out of victory by shadowy forces, the writer presented an alarming but perfectly plausible scenario.ldquoWhat the lack of any sort of formal concession from Trump would do is clear: for his legions of adoring supporters, they would also never believe that Biden had won ndash or that he was the recognised president, whether or not the electoral map or the popular vote proved it,\" observed the author Chris Cillizza, CNNrsquos editor-at large.As Cillizza explained further, the implications of this are obvious, meaning that for many Americans, Biden would be viewed as an illegitimate president and, therefore, not someone who needed to be listened to.ldquoThe result isnrsquot hard to imagine: an even deeper ide within the country between the Trumpists and everyone . A ide that would make Bidenrsquos pledge to create One America again an absolute pipe dream, Cillizza concluded.As America undergoes this traumatic period of soul searching, Trump is now facing multiple crises that cannot be solved by a single tweet. This will not stop him trying, of course, just as negative poll results will not deter him from pulling out all the stops in seeking another term in office.As he turns  today, any number of things could change Donald Trumprsquos political fortunes in the next five months before the election. Who knows, perhaps the US economy will make a leap forward or he can ride on the back of America creating a vaccine for Covid- More likely, though,he wins it will be because of his usual disregard for political norms and a willingness to sacrice the great good of the United States for his own opportunist benefit.Then again, perhaps the ongoing national trauma has at last finally done enough to show Americans the true face of Trump.He will not go easilyat all. The only certain thing now is that a perfect storm is coming in the shape of Novemberrsquos election."},{"url":null,"title":"spotlight-strange-colourful-life-scotsman-invented-paper-money","story":"John Law wasnrsquot just a man of ideas, flawed as his principal one turned out to be in practice. He was also a gambler, a playboy, a killer and a flamboyant and utterly credible serial chancer.He was born in  into a wealthy family of bankers and goldsmiths. His father William had bought Lauriston Castle, an estate at Cramond on the Firth of Forth. Young Law studied at the High School of Edinburgh and at the age of  went into the familyrsquos banking business.When he was , Law Senior died and he inherited the family estate and wealth but instead of settling down to be Law of Lauriston, the family title, he upped for London where he managed to gamble away not just the family silver but the bricks and mortar, mortgaging the estate to pay his debts..However, the losses at the tables, coupled with his quick and analytical mind, had introduced him to the science of probability, mentally calculating the odds of a card turning up based on what he had memorised in the previous hands.In , when he was , a flirtation with young Elizabeth Villiers, later to become Countess of Orkney, inflamed a rival for her hand, Edward \"Beau\" Wilson, who challenged him to a duel. Law killed Wilson with a single pass of his sword.He was arrested, charged with murder, sentenced to death at the Old Bailey but managed to escape to Europe and, again, the gambling tables.Just how he did it isnrsquot clear, but Law managed to make enemies of the sherfs of Venice, Genoa and Paris, and was expelled from each of them. But before he was thrown out of the French capital he had made friends with a young royal, the Duke of Orleans, who would become the key to his future ndash and demise.Law, obsessed with mathematics and monetary theory, had written a series of books and pamphlets, and in  had ed to Scotland and published his book, Money And Trade Considered. His proposal for establishing a national bank was vetoed by the Scottish Parliament which, two years later, voted itself out of office with the Act of Union. Law, again at risk of arrest for his killing of Wilson, fled once more to Europe.He spent the next decade in France and the Netherlands making himself rich with a series of dodgy financial schemes. In , Louis XIV, the \"Sun King\", died leaving the country on the cusp of bankruptcy. The Duke of Orleans became regent and took over the reins of government, summoning his old friend Law to Paris to sort the economy.Law convinced him that trading in coinage was restrictive and that a paper currency would stimulate trade and boost employment. The regent allowed him to mount a small-scale test. He and his brother established the Banque General, issuing bank notes, rather than coins. Lawrsquos currency became sought after and was soon trading at % over face value. The bank opened branches across France and it, and the use of paper money boomed, trade and employment picked up, and the duke was convinced.The young manrsquos influence was not to stop there and he proposed a far more ambitious scheme. France then owned the Mississippi River territories ndash the present-day states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota ndash and he convinced the regent to allow him to set up a company which had a monopoly on trade there. The Compagnie du Mississippi was born.The duke also appointed him controller general of ginance, the second most powerful man in the country, and by  he had merged all of the French trading companies ndash from tobacco farms, the mint, even the national debt ndash into the massive conglomerate which was the Mississippi company.Law issued shares in the company which were over-subscribed. The share price flew, leading to one of the wildest speculative manias in history. Fortunes were made overnight, millions in a day. People from all classes rushed to the small street where Law lived, Rue Quincampoix, bidding for shares.Lawrsquos paper money scheme had, it seemed, overturned the normal economic rules.In June,  years ago almost to the day, Sir Isaac Newton, who knew much about gravity,not the rise and fall of stocks, ed to his Westminster townhouse and wrote in his diary about a meeting he had had that day at the Mint with two men who had persuaded him to invest in the South Sea Company. That company had been formed in  by an act of parliament to conduct all of Englandrsquos trade with Spanish colonies in the West Indies and South America, although there was little trade and even less profit.Newton had been an early investor but had sold out at a substantial profit. But now there was a far more adventurous scheme, one which would challenge the traditional enemies, the French and Lawrsquos Mississippi Company, by privatising all pound million of Englandrsquos debt into the South Sea Company, infor which the government was to receive a pound.m cash sum.The company was involved in the slave trade with the Spanish colonies and in whaling but was, in fact, just an elaborate and early Ponzi scheme. In order to pay the pound.m to the government the company needed to find the cash, which it did, issuing more and more new stock at higher and higher prices, meanwhile bribing friends and allies to buy shares, even providing them with loans to do so. The historian John Carswell likened the process to a financial pump, ldquoeach spurt of stock being accompanied by a draught of cash to suck it up again, leaving the level higher than before. The price of stock went up from pound to pound, in a year. There was a frenzy to invest.In France, however, the idea which inspired the South Sea bubble, the Mississippi company, was in trouble. What Law hadnrsquot calculated was the effect that the issuing of millions of shares would have on the money supply and on inflation. Prices were rising by over % a month. The public was also twigging that the Mississippi delta wasnrsquot a Garden of Eden, rather a mosquito-plagued swamp.There was a run on the shares, the banks and paper money. There were riots on the streets of Paris with people crushed to death in the rush to withdraw what coins there were from the banks.In England the South Sea shares were also collapsing, triggering bankruptcies in companies and people who had bought on credit. Banks and goldsmiths went under as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of iniduals were ruined, including many members of the aristocracy.An inquiry was set up in England which reported in , revealing widespread fraud in government. Among those implicated were the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Aislabie, as well the Postmaster General and two lords, heads of ministries.Aislabi was found guilty of the ldquomost notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption, and imprisoned.The collapse left many people destitute. Hundreds of suicides were attributed to the financial collapse of the company and the Riot Act had to be read to prevent disturbances outside Parliament.In Paris, Lawrsquos bank and his company became bankrupt overnight and he was fortunate to flee with his le, and one diamond, having been one of the richest and most influential men in the country. Nine years later, the \"man lsquoorsquo pairts\" from Cramond died in penury in Venice.Isaac Newton, who had suffered badly as a result of economic gravity, lost his holding but, apart from being the greatest mind of his generation , he was clearly a dab hand at business. When he died six years after the South Sea bubble burst his estate was valued at pound,, around poundm today."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-schools-unlikely-return-normal-next-summer","story":"John Swinney stressed he did not want part-time schooling to continue for \"a minute longer than necessary\", but social distancing means changes haveto be made.He said there will be a legal requirement for parents to send their children to school, but no legal requirement to enforce home learning.It comes after union leaders warned blended learning, in which pupils only attend school on certain days or weeks, could last the entire school year when pupilson August .Next years exams could also be cancelled or pushed back.Mr Swinney toldthe BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland: \"I dont want it to go on for a minute longer than its necessary, because I accept that the blended learning model is not as good a model as the one that we had before coronavirus had the effect that it had, resulting in lockdown.\"But he said it was \"unlikely\" things wouldto normal before the end of the school year, adding: \"Well have to maintain the social distancing approaches for some considerable time to come.\"There will be changes and dferences in the way we deliver education as a consequence of the requirements of physically distancing.\"Mr Swinney said it will be a legal requirement for parents to send their children to school, but \"considered discussions\" will take place with families.However home learning will not be a legal requirement.Mr Swinney said: \"What we will be doing is our level best to support parents and young people in utilising the home learning opportunities that are going to be available.\"TheEducation Secretary said there is a \"working assumption\" that exams will take place next year.However schools are also being asked to prepare for these being cancelled.Mr Swinney said exams ndash which normally start in lateApril ndash could also be pushed back.He said: \"I dont view this as an ideal way of delivering education.Id much prefer to have formal, full-time schooling in place.\"I accept that its not as good as what we had before coronavirus,but needs must, I suppose.\"He said he was \"all for\" ideas around hiring more teachers and opening up public buildings for schooling.He added: \"Im prepared to engage in a conversation about that, but I want to see the plans coming forward that would substantiate that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"little-britains-david-walliams-matt-lucas-apologise-blackface","story":"In identical statements posted to Twitter on Saturday evening, Lucas and Walliams described how they are ldquovery sorry for ldquoplaying characters of other races.The comedy duo say they ldquowant to make it clear that it was wrong.Sketches for the once-popular TV show Little Britain included Walliams dressed up as black female character Desiree DeVere and Lucas as a Thai bride named Ting Tong. sketch show Come Fly With Me featured a range of characters working in an airport that saw Walliams and Lucas dressing up in blackface.Matt  I have both spoken publicly in recent years of our regret that we played characters of other races.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers. Participants can also submit comments during the meeting using Zoom’s ‘Chat’ .The event is free and open to all businesses.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168438.jpg--.jpg?1591781511000\n","title":"local translink staff in grocery donation drive","story":" Translink staff in Ballymena Bus and Rail Station have responded to the COVID- emergency by starting a special grocery donation drive for people in need in their local community.

Less than half of childminders have stayed open in lockdown, and only for families on the original list of key workers.But that#s begun to change this past week, Ms Lewsley Mooney said.She added: We#re at a more positive position than we have been before.I think the Department of Education and the Executive realised that childcare is a linchpin to any process moving forward.In May she told Stormont#s education committee childminders had been brought to their knees by Covid-.Now about  people have registered their interest to become childminders, which she said was promising for a sector hit hard by the pandemic.But families are still calling on Stormont for clarity as more parentsto work.This week more than  people, including SDLP MP Claire Hanna, signed an open letter to the Health and Education Ministers for a roadmap for the sector reopening, and a long-term childcare strategy.Ulster University#s Ciara Fitzpatrick, who drafted the letter along with FactCheck NI founder Orna Young, said some families felt they had no choice but to send their children to grandparents or people who are shielding.She said there also needed to be more information on what the Executive#s new bubble policy meant for childcare, adding: I think parents feel like they have been forgotten about and they haven#t had the space to actually discuss how challenging the current situation has been for them.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said childcare would be key in future -to-work decisions.She said the number of providers operating was expected to increase with demand.

Surgeries were put on hold at the Children#s Hospital in Belfast when the restrictions were first introduced in March.This meant the young patient had to endure further months of an exhausting regime of kidney dialysis seven nights a week, making it uncertain he could even start primary school this year.After carefully studying the risks involved of operating during the pandemic, his medical team asked the family to take a leap of faith and perform the surgery.The operation followed the success of the adult renal and nephrology service, who have performed around  transplants from deceased donors since the start of lockdown.Dr Karl McKeever is the patient#s consultant and clinical director in the Children#s Hospital.He told the Belfastit was a proud day for the team after a frightening period when all bets were off on when surgeries for children could resume.He also spoke of the touching moment the young boy celebrated on the ward after his operation.Everybody was very frightened about what lay ahead, he said.This particular patient was already teed up for a transplant because of high clinical need before the pandemic.That had to be postponed and the clock was ticking because other patients can sadly die on dialysis.That has been the case in other parts of the world that have been harder hit and haven#t been able to start their services.The team faced a dficult decision between protecting the donor and patient from Covid- and the harm of doing nothing.Work started with Dr Mairead Convery, a consultant paediatric nephrologist, networking with management in the Belfast Trust and other experts across the UK to assess the risk.After collecting enough data, the team concluded that with the proper safety measures, the risk of Covid- to the donor and patient was small.It#s been a very exciting time amidst all the bad times, said Dr McKeever. It#s so transforming for the family who have had to take that leap of faith.The impact of dialysis and what families have to go through needs to be seen to be believed and is very humbling for us.He continued: I always remember when the little boy ed to the ward a few days after his surgery and chanted #We did it, we did it!#It was particularly interesting to see the awareness he had at such a young age about what was going on in society around them.He understood why it had been held up, so to see it come off in such a good way with all of the team involved was amazing.Between two and six kidney transplants are usually performed at the Children#s Hospital each year.The numbers are low so it wasn#t a worry we couldn#t catch up, but it was the risk to the patients as the days went by on dialysis waiting for this le-changing surgery, Dr McKeever said.So, it#s just been super for this wee man and his family. After going through so much in recent years, I#d say they#re not entering a new chapter as much as a new book.Dr Convery added she was absolutely delighted to be first paediatric centre in the UK and Ireland to perform a living donor transplant during lockdown and thanked staff for their perseverance in giving a child the most amazing gt.Most importantly, we would like to thank our patient, their family and the donor for their courage and cooperation throughout the process.

Singing is also discouraged, and the passing of an offering plate among worshippers must not be your practice for the foreseeable future.The document says that in relation to the administration of the sacraments, guidance is still being considered by Church leaders and will be communicated in due course.Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk to the General Assembly, said the lockdown restrictions had been a painful experience for worshippers. The past three months of lockdown across the island of Ireland has presented unprecedented challenges, he said. For our ministers and congregations, this has included the enforced closure of our church buildings and an inability to meet together for worship face-to-face. While undoubtedly this has been a painful experience for many, I have been encouraged to see how our people have adapted to share God#s Word creatively online, and keep in contact with members and others in the community through phone calls, emails and old-fashioned letters.He said theto normal church services posed more complex problems than the sudden closure had. As lockdown restrictions gradually ease, our congregations must think carefully and responsibly about the practical preparations necessary to facilitate theof worship services and other aspects of church le, he added. Each congregation#s circumstances will be dferent and they will come to a iety of decisions about what activities to recommence, and how quickly this can happen. However, meeting together with brothers and sisters in Christ is central to Christian le and a primary expression of church as the family of God.And we look forward to having the opportunity to do so once again.Belfast Most ReadPastor Barrie Halliday charged after Black Lives Matter commentsHundreds gather to protect war memorials outside Belfast City HallCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two further Covid- deaths confirmedNorthern Ireland teachers hit back at DUP MP Wilson#s #shameful and reckless# jibes overto class Why former BBC NI presenters Noel Thompson and Seamus McKee aren#t the retiring type,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to allow clubs to plan and work towards the start of the   season and the playing of rugby matches. September has been given as the month in which rugby matches will be permitted tofor clubs. Given the changing nature of the reopening of society and the recovery from the Covid- pandemic, a specic date will not be issued until further clarity is available and will remain subject to change. The given date will also factor in a minimum window of five weeks permitted for contact training ahead of ato rugby matches. googletag.cmd.push The Competition Stage is the final stage in the summary roadmap of the IRFU Return To Rugby Guidelines. All clubs are currently in the Covid- Safety Planning Stage, which they must complete before moving to the resumption of training at any level. The IRFU are working toward a modied season for  . The governing body recognises concerns over travel, safety and expense and this will be reflected in the season’s structure. Clubs should expect that games at the start of the season will be kept local where practicable. This is another welcome step in ourto rugby. There is a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes in clubs at present as they put Health  Safety plans in place to manage the risk of Covid-. This announcement helps give us all something to work towards, commented Greg Barrett, Chair of the IRFU Rugby Committee. googletag.cmd.push It’s important for rugby players to have competitive sport to look forward to and they deserve to know that ourto rugby guidelines are built around their welfare. We will provide further clarity on what the   season will look like, but what we can say is that the first matches permitted will keep travel to a minimum. This should help with concerns around travel, but our hope is that this will also serve as an opportunity for the rugby community to support their clubs and help generate some much needed cash-flow. For now, I would urge clubs to continue to focus on completing the Covid- Safety Planning Stage of our guidelines and availing of the education  training supports that the IRFU have put in place. That is ultimately what will lead to the resumption of rugby as we know it. RELATED - Mixed feelings over ato local GAA action. More...

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off.

I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls.

GAA GOLD, a new archive based series from TG, looks back at the ’s through the prism of the GAA year.  Each programme focuses on one year and we travel through the GAA season with a mixture of all of the classic games, news stories and music hits from that year. The first programme of the series starts with the year and the programmecharts that year’s twists and turns on Gaelic fields throughout the land with league finals, provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and All-Ireland finals. That year end ends with Joe Connolly’s emotional and evocative speech on the steps of the Hogan Stand with the cheeky line of “People of Galway, we love you! googletag.cmd.push In  All Ireland Football Final, there was Seacuteamus Darbys famous goal that shocked Kerry - and the nation - to end their five in-a-row hopes. In the Hurling Final the Cats claimed their nd All-Ireland title captained by a young man named Brian Cody. In  we will see Jimmy Barry-Murphy’s famous rocket goal against Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Michael O’Hehir on commentary said“This is one you need to see in slow motion but the slow motion won’t even slow it down!”.  In the Minor hurling final there is a young man named Niall Quinn playing for the Dubs against Galway. He scored a great point on the day and would go on to score  international goals for the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The Football Final that year saw  players sent off in the Dublin v Galway battle. googletag.cmd.push The series will include the  Ulster Football Final - Frank McGuigan was on fire for Tyrone that day and scored  points from play - each one better than the last as Tyrone claimed their first provincial title since  in Clones.  This was also the GAA’s centenary year with the All-Ireland Hurling Final held in Semple Stadium between Cork and Offaly. We hwill see the first ever International Rules tests between Ireland and Australia from that year with plenty of action on and off the ball. In  we have some action from the first ever Ladies Football Final to be played at Croke Park. The Kerry’s Ladies team went one better than the men as they claimed a‘five in-a-row’ with victory over Wexford. There are other more quirkier events in the GAA season too. In  a National Football League Quarter-final between Dublin and Cork ended in a draw. Cork failed to reappear for extra-time so Dublin ran the ball down unopposed and shot into an empty Cork net to claim a very unusual victory. All of these great memories can be seen in this new GAA GOLD series with the soundtrack of the era - a mix of both international and Irish acts such as U, Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, Mamas Boys, The Undertones, Cry Before Dawn, Sineacutead O’Connor, The Dubliners, The Hothouse Flowers, The Stunning and many more.

It was the greatest walk of all and following the opening of Shamrock Park, following the sporting lockdown, they are again thinking of that famous journey to Thurles. On the re-opening of walkways around GAA grounds, this was an opportunity to get people back out again socialising as a club community and using the club grounds with their Trip  Tipp initiative. The idea was to get as many families as possible out walking, running or crawling, each doing a  mile leg of the  mile journey in allocated, socially distanced, safe slots. googletag.cmd.push A pound contribution per family was requested, with all proceeds going to aid football and camogie youth restarting back training, with the expected rules and regulations that will surely be in place. The uptake was fantastic with  families taking partand more families looking to take part every day so they surpassed their  mile journey!. The club wish to place on record their thanks to all those that participated or helped out in any way preparing the grounds, sorting and fitting hand sanitizers, marking the walkways for one way social distance adherence, with special mention to Paul McIver who was the driving force behind this excellent initiative. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

John O’Neill, from Ballinderry, took to the roads around the village to document the lives of local parishioners during the Covid- lockdown. The project is still ongoing, but Fr Peter Donnelly from St Patrick’s Church in the parish, says the donation of pound, is very welcome. “It is very much appreciated by the entire Ballinderry family as this would be additional expenditure, which has become necessary,” he told the County Derry Post. “Because of the health emergency, we’ve had to seriously think about introducing a webcam, and all of these improvements are costly, and this money will go towards that. googletag.cmd.push “It was very generous of him with his time and photography expertise. It was a kind thought indeed and it was well supported.” The project grew momentum after a local man, Charlie Collins, presented John with a list of  people in the parish who were over . “I would touch base, or say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact,” said John. “I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or had a family member keeping an eye out. “The older folk were asking about how they would buy a photo, so I did a flat rate and said % would go to Fr Donnelly down in Ballinderry chapel.” googletag.cmd.push One of Johns shots from the project. Pic: John ONeill - Sperrins Photography. Fr Donnelly said the thought of a photographer doing the rounds was enough to give the parish’s elderly parishioners a boost. “The older members found it enormously important and looked forward to getting prepared to have their photographs taken,” he said. “John managed to capture their dferent personalities very well. There are many ways of taking a photo but the artistry is in capturing the character of the person themselves. “I thought he got everyone’s personality very well. Rather than people feeling a bit self-conscious or formal, he was able to put them at ease. “It was a wonderful idea and it was very heartening to see it so well supported.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A number of complaints had been raised about the booking system put in place following the easement of coronavirus restrictions. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said some constituents had experienced dficulty when trying to make a same-day booking, but moves have since been made to improve the service. “I asked the Environmental Services Director to improve the current system to ensure there are less issues when trying to book a slot including provision same day booking,” said Cllr McGurk. “I very much welcome the improvements that the council team have now implemented and praise should be given to the quick response to the complaints. googletag.cmd.push “The new online booking systems which is being rolled out should streamline the service for all users.” The online system, which will facilitate same-day booking, will be trialled at sites in Coleraine and Limavady this week, with the council hoping to roll it out to all sites within a fortnight. The number of slots has also been increased to allow for four vehicles every ten minutes, with a view to increasing it to six vehicles this week. In the meantime, the council has increased the number of operators taking bookings to seven at centres that do not yet have the online booking system in place. googletag.cmd.push “I appreciate there have been frustrations caused by the booking system and some have called for its removal entirely,” said Cllr McGurk “However it is essential that we maintain it for the meantime to avoid the long queues and congestion seen in other Council areas. “It is also worth noting that since the introduction of the booking system, most council recycling centres are working to full capacity with slots being entirely filled for the following day. “If this wasn’t managed correctly it would lead to peak usage times which would have the potential to overwhelm staff at the centres and cause traffic issues. “Whilst this may not have been as likely a scenario in smaller recycling centres, it was important that the same approach was taken to all centres across the council area.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square.

It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS.

In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

Crops lay flat in the fields from the constant pounding of the rain. As a family of farmers it was an extremely dficult time.ldquoIn between the deluges we managed to scramble our way to the first Irish Senior Cup final and emerged victorious mdash a rare moment of sunshine that year.For Paul, then a teenager still at school, the memories of  years ago are still vivid.ldquoIt was my first year in the st XI, playing alongside my father and Alfie. They were  and  years young at that time and still playing well.ldquoIn fact, the following year, in the same competition, I sat in amazement watching Alfie blast a ton against a Bangor with John Elder leading the attack, having opened the bowling for Ireland against Australia earlier that summer in front of , people at Downpatrick.ldquoAnyway, Alfie smashed nine huge sixes, all clearing the Strangford Road end. This was at a spritely age of .ldquoAll of a sudden I realised the legendary tales of Alfiersquos big hitting were true. Dad always said he hit the ball much further than anyone . That innings remains the most memorable I have seen from a Downpatrick player. saw the ICU as it was then bring in bowl-outs to decide washed-out contests, with all  players trying to hit the stumps in a shoot-out.In the first round Downpatrick faced Leinster and of the  players who aimed, only one was successful mdash the aforementioned Alfie.Downpatrick had reached the final after a famous win in the lionrsquos den of Donemana, with Brian Ferris and Jim Patterson smashing unbeaten fties in an emphatic victory.ldquoThere was a lot of publicity surrounding the Irish Senior Cup which at that time was sponsored by Schweppes, said Paul.ldquoIn the years that followed, just like the inter-pros played for the Guinness Cup, everyone simply called the competition lsquoThe Schweppesrsquo. In more recent times, the Ulster Cup was known as lsquoThe Clubturfrsquo.ldquoBefore the final, BBC TV sent a crew down to interview some of us, and ironically record us bowling at the stumps. It was still raining. It took us ages to hit the stumpshellipI got abuse at school.ldquoNeedless to say, the final was washed out without a bowl bowled and the miserable summer continued. It was desperately disappointing after a week of huge anticipation.The toss for the venue of the replay was conducted over the phone between the two captains, Ian Shields and Derek McCann.Downpatrick won and the replay was scheduled for midweek, Wednesday, September , and North Downrsquos Robin Haire recalls the conditions werenrsquot really fit for cricket.ldquoDownpatrick had actual puddles of water on parts of outfield, he recalled. ldquoMy abiding memory of that final was the spray of the water when you hit it along the ground.ldquoIt was totally unplayable, but the authorities wanted it played and out of the way. Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three. I was a very nervous  year-old when I arrived at the wicket after they had put on . Keith was going well and I just needed to stay in.ldquoAnyway, desperate to get off the mark, I predicted Robin Haire was going to bowl me a long hop. I was right back on the stumps, ready to smash it, when he fired in a quicker ball which crashed into my ankles in front of middle. Out for a duck in the All-Ireland Cup final. I was beyond devastated as cricket was everything to me.ldquoWe eventually won by six wickets as our experienced side adopted a safety-first attitude, taking no risks. Derek McCann lted the famous trophy and Downpatrick were All-Ireland champions.There were to be no champagne celebrations for the teenager though.ldquoUnfortunately, I was too young to down a couple of beers, so it was straight back home after the final for Dad and I, two All-Ireland champions.Six years later, Downpatrick would secure the trophy for the second time in one of the most thrilling encounters ever, overcoming North by three runs.There was to be no personal glory though for Paul Linehan as he missed out on the chance of redemption.ldquoThe disappointment of making a duck remains as I was never to play in another All-Ireland final, having been injured for the  victory, he said.ldquoHowever, all these years later, my  medal is still very much a prized possession..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C June 10%2C 2000  ","story":"TYRELLA mdash Tyrella beach has retained a prestigious European award which recognises the quality of the local tourist facility.The beach is one of eight in the province to receive the highly sought after Blue Flag Award, the highest possible recognition for cleanliness.Down Council chiefs are delighted Tyrella has once again been recognised for its quality, and the amount of effort they put into maintaining it, in the annual Tidy Britain Group awards.The awards were officially handed over on Monday along with the prestigious Blue Flag which will continue to fly high over Tyrella for the next  months.The beach was rigorously examined in an unannounced inspection by a  of European experts who focused their attention on cleanliness and the environmental management of Tyrella.Council official Leonard Lawson said everyone was delighted their efforts have again been recognised.ldquoThe award also recognises the councilrsquos effort to manage the beach, provide information points, educational material and detailed displays in the beach centre, he said.ldquoThe water quality is also critical to ensure Blue Flag status is retailed and the council aims to continue to work hard to maintain its high standards.NEWCASTLE mdash Armed robbers made off with over pound, in cash yesterday morning after a hold-up at a Newcastle bank.The three masked men burst into the Northern Bank in Main Street at .am and order everyone inside to co-operate.

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high demand.Local SDLP MLA Colin McGrath also welcomed the plannersrsquo approval.He said: ldquoThe housing development at the old Downe site has been a protracted and drawn out process.ldquoHaving been in regular contact with Clanmil to see what were the outstanding issues holding this development back to hear that council planners are to approve the next stage of the development at long last is very

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

Catching up will take a huge effort. Where are the resources for this Reading scores for example affect exam results and from there access to higher education and employment.This is serious.I can only imagine the stress and angst some parents are feeling as they struggle with home teaching.As the paper reported it is the disadvantaged who are becoming more disadvantaged. Does anyone seriously believe that children who can’t or won’t work at home at the best of times are doing so now  Many children will be falling further behind.Why aren’t we talking about how to get our children back at school  Naturally parents, children and staff are fearful of ato school, so let’s look at what the science and the scientists say. Either it is safe to go to school or it isn’t.According to the Depart ment Health Northern Ireland Dashboard one person under  has died in NI and not one under  and % of the deaths have been of people over , and the Office of National Statistics reports thatyou are under  you have a one in a million chance of dying ProfessorKarol Sikora, who holds a double first from Cambridge and wasformerly Director of Cancer services at the World Health Organisationsaid with regard to primary school and nurseries “opening schools is absolutely vital” ...“the people who are suffering most are the most disadvantaged” and “the evidence that young children spread this is almost zero”. He goes onto say ,”why wait until September ” The Chief Scientic Officer of the WHO mirrors his views.Prof John Lee, Professor of Clinical Pathology at Hull, sums it up thus “The majority of cases are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms are not fever, cough, headache and respiratory symptoms they are no symptoms at all. Somewhere around . per cent of those who catch the disease recover.”The re-opening of schools in a phased and conditional way places immense stress on principals  School Management Teamswho will have to reassure children, parents and staff whilst at the same time organising staff rotas, part class rotas, year group rotas, curriculum arrangements — say  subjects, staffing, desks ,movements, toilets, canteens, ,break times and so on and in many cases teach. In a post primary school with  in a year group – so  classes – which, with phasing, would mean with, each class ided into ,  sub groups— the school has five year groups then that is  sub groups to rotate across eg  subjects with probably a rotated staff.Similarly in a primary school, complicated by the principal with a substantial teaching commitment.How do you do it, how do you ensure continuity of education The ‘safety measures’ — masks, screens, Personal Protection Equipmentetc give the illusion of safety whilst increasing fear and anxiety and this will hugely increasethechildren do notto school soon. I see groups of children playing and associating naturally – sothey go into school and have to stay two metres apart,how absurd is that  .Mental health issues are on the increase in schools as it is — there aren’t enough resources at the moment, there is a crisis looming when the children–we continue to fill them with fear. Principals are faced with one particularly dficult dilemma. Given that the government is not putting in any extra money, the principal can phasechildren in say one day a week and they miss out on their complete education, GCSE preparation etc orthey can bring in lots of subs and run the budget into chaos, for which they willbe heavily criticised.The obstacles are insurmountable.Our children need educated in an environment conducive to learning, not one filled with fear and anxiety. Feedback from the teacher and social interaction is what makes learning happen, why the need for complicated and impractical phasing  It is either safe or it isn’t.Michael Fullan, the esteemed educationalist said, “scratch a good teacher and you will find a moral purpose” and now is surely the time to demonstrate our moral purpose as public servants. Surely it is up to the UK and Irish governmentsto assuage fears the of the public first, then people willwillingly to the proper learning environment As FD Roosevelt said “there is nothing to fear, but fear itself”.• Hugh McCarthy is a former principal of Killicomaine Junior High School——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I must also say I have a degree of sympathy for the police in terms of them trying to enforce legislation that is not particularly clear or consistent.”Councillor Martin Reilly, SDLP group leader, when also asked plainlyhe condemns the police, said: “I’m not going to answer something without first of all having spoken to the party press office.”The News Letter had in fact already spoken to the press office on Thursday a press officer said they would speak to Colum Eastwood, but no response was ever forthcoming.Meanwhile the News Letter can also reveal the Charity Commission is now considering looking into NWMF.The commission’s guidance says trustees must make sure their charity acts in accordance with the law, including health and safety law.The commission said: “I can confirm that the matter has been referred to our enquiries team to consider further.”Charity accounts show the NWMF was funded in  overwhelmingly from two sources – the Big Lotteryand The Executive Office.Together they provided about £, of its roughly £, funds. About £, of that was spent on “Wages and Pension Costs” and “Other Program Costs”.WHO IS LILIAN SEENOI-BARR :Lilian Seenoi-Barr is in her late s and came to Northern Ireland from Kenya as an asylum seeker in December .She founded the North West Migrants Forum in .Asked about the nature of her asylum claim by the News Letter, she refused to discuss it, telling the paper to look where for information about it.In , the IMF stated that “Kenya has acquired a deserved reputation as one of the most stable states in Africa”.It added that whilst there had been some political violence, ethnic clashes, and other disturbances, “the state has managed to keep all of these in check”.A video posted online by the Women on the Move Awards in  features Ms Seenoi-Barr saying she is a member of the Maasai group in Kenya, and that she started what she described as a “rescue” programme for Maasai girls “to empower them and take them to school”.She said: “I managed to rescue over , girls in five years.”She went on: “The elders in the community were not happy at all with my work, and I started receiving a lot of threats and I had to leave.”The SDLP said that “upon arriving in Derry she struggled to integrate due to the lack of services and support”.She went on to stand for election in  for Derry City and Strabane District Council, but failed to win a seat, being narrowly beaten to the last post by independent Sean Carr.After her defeat, two months later in July she was elected to serve as chairwoman of the party’s Derry  Strabane District Executive.

It should be treated as such by all in government.“As the rest of the economy and public services in Northern Ireland begin toto normal, we all want to see our church congregations able to worship together safely once again.”Last weekend, the Irish government indicated that churches in the Republic can re-open for public worship from Monday, June . Church re-opening in the south would probably force the Stormont Executive to make a similar move as the four main denominationsand even churches like the Baptists and Free Presbyterians, operate on an all-Ireland basis with some parishes and congregations in Fermanagh and Tyrone straddling the border.The Church of Ireland, meanwhile, has provided protocol guidance to its parishioners in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for dealing with ato churches for services.The church says the guidance is not intended to replace those issued by statutory authorities in both jurisdictions and should always be interpreted in the light of official public health advice. A letter issued by the CoI primate the Rev John McDowell said many of the issues raised may be applicable to other purposes or to other church buildings. “Further advice will follow in relation to the re-opening of churches for activities other than worship or the opening of other parish buildings,” said the primate.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_accecdcadfbedbbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcccaadcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
