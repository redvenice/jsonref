In retrospect, the nightmare agony of my 17 years with Vivienne seems to me preferable to the dull misery of the mediocre teacher of philosophy which would have been the alternative.\u0027         More than a thousand letters released by Princeton University in New Jersey provide an extraordinary insight into the troubled love life of the writerThat awful marriage, he says, \u0027brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land\u0027.In the letter, Eliot also provides new insight into the other momentous decision in his life — to defy his wealthy Boston family and live his life in England after Oxford. He describes a \u0027life-changing\u0027 meeting in 1914 with the expat U.S. poet Ezra Pound, who encouraged him to stay in England.Eliot said all he wanted of Vivienne was \u0027a flirtation or a mild affair\u0027 but that he was \u0027too shy and unpractised to achieve either with anybody\u0027. He \u0027persuaded\u0027 himself he loved her simply so he could commit himself to staying in England. She in turn persuaded herself she would \u0027save the poet\u0027 by keeping him there.Later, Eliot accepted a one-year poetry professorship at Harvard in 1932 and exploited the fact that his wife couldn\u0027t accompany him. He saw Miss Hale in California, where she was teaching, and saw her \u0027from time to time\u0027 every summer in later years when she came to stay with family in the Cotswolds.He says he only realised he didn\u0027t love her when his wife died in 1947. \u0027Gradually I came to see that I had been in love only with a memory, with the memory of the experience of having been in love with her in my youth,\u0027 he writes.He started to see how little they had in common. He writes witheringly that he not only knew she wasn\u0027t interested in his poetry but that she was also guilty of \u0027insensitiveness and bad taste\u0027.One of her most serious failings, apart from her lack of respect for his strong views on religion and orce, appears to be that she cared more for the opinion of a \u0027woolly-minded\u0027 uncle than she did for his. \u0027It may be too harsh, to think that what she liked was my reputation rather than my work,\u0027 he adds.         Pictured: Emily Hale and T.S. Eliot pose in a 1946 photo in Dorset, VermontT.S. Eliot expert Craig Raine said Eliot\u0027s \u0027devastating letter\u0027 to the executors was a qualification of his love letters to Hale. \u0027Take them with a sackful of salt, is what he is saying,\u0027 he explains.Eliot\u0027s unhappiness with both these two central women in his life contrasted deeply with the happiness he found with his second wife, Valerie, the second Mrs Eliot, who married him in 1957 and died only in 2012.After hearing his poem The Journey Of The Magi as a schoolgirl, she became obsessed by Eliot and reportedly told her headmaster that her ambition in life was to become the poet\u0027s secretary.She joined the typing pool at his publisher, Faber, and did become his secretary, eventually earning the literary hero\u0027s gratitude. \u0027It is only within the last few years that I have known what it was to love a woman who truly, selflessly and wholeheartedly loves me,\u0027 he writes. \u0027I find it hard to believe that the equal of Valerie ever has been or will be again.\u0027Eliot\u0027s troubled relationships with women prompted at least one biographer to conclude he was homosexual. Although he took a vow of chastity in 1928, aged 40, some experts believe it wasn\u0027t until he married his second wife when he was 68 (she was 30) that he was really introduced to sex.They made an odd couple, the etiolated Eliot fawning over his big-chested blonde wife at literary parties. So in love was he that he wrote in one poem, A Dedication To My Wife, of \u0027lovers whose bodies smell of each other\u0027.After he died, Valerie fiercely guarded his legacy, although she published some of his letters. But this cache of 1,131 letters to Emily Hale — in which he pours out his heart — shine a pitiless light on his brilliant mind.In one letter he tells Hale \u0027my love is as pure and unseeking as any love can be\u0027 and that \u0027loving and adoring you has given me the very best that I have had in my life\u0027.Eliot was 24 and Hale 21 when they met. A beautiful aspiring actress with a lovely singing voice, she writes that before the awkward Eliot left America for Oxford, \u0027to my great surprise, he told me how very much he cared for me\u0027.In a letter from 1931, by which time they had reconnected, Eliot blames himself for their failure to click and says \u0027when I first knew you I was immature for my age, timid and intensely egotistical\u0027.Ten months after the death of his first wife, he wrote to her: \u0027It is always you or nobody.\u0027He would address her in his letters as \u0027My Saint\u0027, \u0027My Emily my dear\u0027 and \u0027My Lady Emily\u0027 and signs off \u0027yours devotedly\u0027.His devotion, however, clearly withered when he learned that she was making it available for public consumption. "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan helped pictures couple hike Vancouver Abigail Spencer","story":"Kit your little one out in Archie\u0026#39s adorable jacket from BodenThe Sussexes have been taking a break to enjoy their first Christmas as a family of three.

How nice to be a reader of books, so that one can indulge a lifelong wanderlust without even bothering to get out of bed.One lustful and wandering writer who did get out of bed was Henry Miller. For those in need of literary vitamin D to counter the winter gloom, I recommend his sun-blessed The Colossus of Maroussi. At the onset of the second world war, Miller found himself in Greece – a period of his life that left him spiritually transformed. Reading his account of those few months is like bathing in supernal light. Everything resplends. He doesn’t even bother to chuck in the sex scenes that made his other books notorious – there’s too much going on in the Aegean sky, the wine-dark sea and the Homeric landscapes.Three hundred years before Miller and the Beat writers he inspired, the Japanese haiku poet and dharma bum Bashō was possessed by a very On the Road kind of inspiration. “I myself have been tempted for a long time by the cloud-moving wind – filled with a strong desire to wander,” he writes in The Narrow Road to the Deep North, before roaming the wilds of 17th-century Japan and rendering all he sees as elegant haiku.Here at the fag end of modernity, the wilds are no longer quite so wild. Not only are the world’s beauty spots black with tourists clutching their phones, experiences too – even the experience of wanderlust – feel inevitably well trodden. The young female travellers in Lucy Sweeney Byrne’s recent story collection Paris Syndrome, who wander about in Mexico, Texas and elsewhere, are as hungry for authentic experience and meaningful connection as they are for exotic landscapes. Another recent book, Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse, follows the author through Paris, Tokyo and Venice as she examines art and literature to understand how women such as Virginia Woolf, George Sand and Jean Rhys related to the cities they inhabited.Arguably the finest and unquestionably the funniest book ever written about travel, Geoff Dyer’s Yoga for People Who Can’t Be Bothered to Do It, so extravagantly upends all expectations one might have about travel writing – and, indeed, about any other genre – that it breaks off to form its own singular, endlessly revisitable literary island. I’d quote the best bits, only that’s the thing: Yoga consists purely of best bits – a journey on which you’re always where you want to be.And how can I avoid the obvious choice: Friedrich Nietzsche. Wanderlust may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the philosopher, yet his books abound with imagery of nature and wandering: clear skies, open seas, bracing winds and – above all – mountains.

It will join the traditional plain, almond, jam and chocolate versions on the bakery counters by Pret’s tills.Hannah Dolan, Pret’s global head of food innovation, said the new product would appeal to customers participating in Veganuary – embracing a plant-based diet for the whole of January – as well as those seeking to reduce their dairy consumption or keen to try something new. “Over the past couple of years we’ve worked hard to introduce new vegan and veggie options,” she said. “We knew from talking to our customers that it was time to bring more choices to the breakfast menu. The very berry croissant is just the beginning – we are looking forward to sharing more plant-based innovations with customers in 2020.”In the UK retail sector, vegan croissants have typically only been available from small independent cafes or niche brands. In November La Boulangère launched a range of vegan croissants and pain au chocolats made with shea butter. Inidually wrapped to be warmed at home, they are sold by Sainsbury’s, Ocado and Morrisons for £2.75 a bag.Other popular pastry snacks have already had successful transformations. On Thursday, the UK’s largest bakery chain Greggs unveiled a meat-free version of its popular “steak bake”, a hotly-anticipated oven-mate to its vegan sausage roll which went on sale in January 2019.In October, Pret announced that it was giving its most popular sandwiches a high-profile vegan makeover. The new “chuna” mayo baguette (with chick peas replacing tuna), VLT (with roasted shiitake mushroom “rashers” in place of bacon), eggless mayo baguette and hoisin mushroom wrap went on sale initially in its five standalone Veggie Pret shops. However, if they prove very popular with customers, they will be rolled out to the main chain too.In a further fillip for customers seeking plant-based options, Pret will announce that from next Tuesday, it is dropping its charge for dairy milk alternatives: with barista-prepared hot and cold drinks, oat and rice-coconut milk will be offered free alongside soya milk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da88640c53805ec4cf1c6ff280a7889f04d2a876/250_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6b80c8476c91ba77a9e2f45f463b00e","title":"the bold new plan for an indigenous led development in vancouver","story":"The Senakw development aims to ease the city’s chronic housing crisis – and to challenge the mindset that indigeneity and urbanity are incompatibleThe scrubby, vacant patch beneath the Burrard Street Bridge in Vancouver looks at first glance like a typical example of the type of derelict nook common to all cities: 11.7 acres of former railway lands, over which tens of thousands of people drive every day.This is not any old swath of underused space, however. It’s one of Canada’s smallest First Nations reserves, where dozens of Squamish families once lived. The village was destroyed by provincial authorities more than a century ago.“We want to bring our people back home to that part of our territory,” says Khelsilem, a Squamish Nation councillor. “People who support new housing are often marginalized out of decision-making, and this is a marginalized community saying, ‘This is how we’re creating value for our nation, and the public at large.”Few First Nations reserves in Canada are found so centrally in urban areas, and this unique location has given the Squamish Nation a chance to explode local city-building norms. Construction begins in 2021, and at more than 500 units per acre, Senakw’s density will reach Hong Kong levels – a fact that is only allowed because Senakw exists not on city land, but on reserve land, which is technically federal.Senakw would be a sharp rebuke to the mindset in Canada that indigeneity and urbanity are incompatible, says Jordan Stanger-Ross, an associate professor of history at British Columbia’s University of Victoria. “In the early history of Vancouver, and colonial cities generally, there is this opposition assumed between the civilization cities are imagined to represent, and the imagined savageness of Indigenous people,” he says. “There is an idea that the two can’t co-exist.”That idea persists, says Ginger Gosnell-Myers, who served from 2013 to 2018 as Vancouver’s first Indigenous Relations Manager. “If you look at where reserves have been placed in this country, they’re largely on the outskirts,” she says. “That’s by design ... we’re looking at a deliberate history of exclusion.”Though the original village here was ostensibly a protected reserve, government and industrial interests chipped away at it. In 1913, the provincial government coerced the remaining Squamish residents into selling their land, placed them on barges bound for the north, and razed the village. For a time the area became a squatter’s camp, and was surrendered altogether by the Squamish nation in 1947.The Canadian Pacific Railway set up a rail terminus here, but when the railway tried to sell the land in 1989, the Squamish said it should revert to reserve status. In 2002, after a long legal battle, they regained a fraction of the land and have been exploring how to use it ever since. “The Squamish Nation kept pushing to explore the near-maximum the site could handle,” said Khelsilem on Twitter last month. “This is our jewel of developable land and we’re only going to get once chance in the next 100 years to develop it.”Even by the standards of architectural rendering, early images of appear optimistic: towers inscribed with Indigenous art, girdled in greenery and rising into blue skies punctuated by flocks of birds. The design proposal was created by Revery Architecture in conjunction with the Squamish Nation, and gave particular attention to the history of the site and its relationship to the natural environment. The idea was to give people crossing the Burrard Street Bridge the feeling of entering a forest as much as a city.If Senakw could be the most dramatic example of the Indigenization of Canadian cities, it’s not the only one. Indigenous communities have long been involved as urban property developers. The Squamish Nation itself is one-third of the MST Property Development Corporation, comprising three Vancouver-area First Nations which have embarked on smaller projects, the goal being the return of profits to the nation’s members for social and community development.Neither is it unique to Canada. In New Zealand, a number of treaty settlements since the 1990s have put urban land in the hands of tribal development groups, and Māori design principles have gradually become more common in both public and private building – particularly in the rebuilding of Christchurch’s city centre following the 2011 earthquake.Not all of the Squamish Nation has praised the project. Some members have raised concerns about the 50-50 profit sharing partnership with Westbank, a private developer better known as a builder of luxury condos. There has also been some pushback from the broader Vancouver community. One city councillor called the height “inconsistent with the values of a liveable city”.“There is extreme demand for rental housing to be built in this city,” says Gosnell-Myers, “and you have a proposal that will meet a lot of that demand. Now it’s the city’s responsibility to act.”Gosnell-Myers says the city must now work with the Squamish Nation to supply amenities for a community of more than 10,000 people: schools, transit connections and other infrastructure. So far, she says, the city has lagged on planning for how quickly the project may come together. “I told the city years ago this was going to happen,” she says. “Part of the problem is that the city doesn’t quite understand the power and potential of these lands, and how fast things can happen.” The Squamish Nation, she says, has “waited more than a century for this. They’re not going to wait any longer.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d86002797af545d0841916848f5330b1edfedcd/75_18_2137_1282/master/2137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfb6e1775a7ad1d6b00d0b9d39141c34","title":"authoritarian leaders people safe voters","story":"With every new year, I typically set aside some time to write down what I’m grateful for. Health, family, friends, books, jazz, my dog, among other things. This year I added something I’ve been taking for granted. It’s democracy.Like many of us, I have worried about the rising tide of rightwing populism, nationalism and polarisation across the world. Within just a few years, we’ve witnessed the election of Donald Trump in the US, the Brexit decision in the UK, the rise of Matteo Salvini in Italy, Victor Orbán in Hungary, the Freedom party in Austria and the Law and Justice party in Poland. The world’s largest democracy, India, is menaced by a newly virulent nationalism and xenophobia.For a long time I wondered what explained the appeal of these apparently fringe movements that, in my view, had accidentally gone mainstream. They seemed like the exception to a general rule of progression towards, not away from, democratic norms. But this year I came to a different conclusion: it’s democracy that is a precious exception to the rule, and one that is extremely fragile, for a simple reason: the human craving for order and security when chaos feels imminent.The philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm first identified this predicament in his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom. The gist of it is this: when people perceive an increase in disorder, they feel tremendous anxiety. Inevitably, this anxiety leads to a quest for security. To bring a sense of safety back into their lives, they latch on to authoritarianism and conformity. As Fromm noted, this often leads to “a readiness to accept any ideology and any leader if only he offers a political structure and symbols which allegedly give meaning and order to an inidual’s life”. He had observed this in Germany, which he fled in 1933: “Modern man still is anxious and tempted to surrender his freedom to dictators of all kinds,” he wrote.Fromm was speculating about this dynamic. But decades later, I and other psychologists have empirically shown how insecurity is linked to the rise of autocrats and the erosion of democracy. In a survey we conducted before the 2016 US presidential election, for example, we asked US residents questions about how fearful they were about various threats, such as illegal immigration, a lack of jobs, crime, terrorism, an attack from Iran, among others. They also responded to statements aimed at gauging their desire for stricter rules and their support for different political candidates, including Trump. We conducted the same survey in 2017 in France, measuring support for Marine Le Pen.The results of both studies were telling: people who felt threatened wanted to tighten up – to have stricter rules – which predicted their support for Trump or Le Pen in the US and France, respectively. Other research confirms the same pattern. Economic threats and the growing gap between the rich and poor also create a sense of chaos and instability. This has led to increased support for strong leaders willing to challenge democratic values and practices.It’s a simple principle, one that is causing democracies all around the world to unravel. When people experience threat – whether actual or imagined – they begin to “tighten”. In physical terms, they tense their muscles, ready to defend themselves. In political terms, they begin to crave security and order in a community that seems to be collapsing. Authoritarian leaders satiate this need by promising quick, simple solutions – and, above all, a return to the tighter social order of yesteryear.Leaders are aware of this basic psychology and exaggerate threats to gain popularity. Trump did so masterfully: at campaign rallies throughout 2015 and 2016, he warned his ever-growing crowds that the US was a nation on the “brink of disaster”. He cited Mexicans supposedly bringing violence across the border, global trade agreements and immigrants taking away jobs, and radicalised Muslims plotting terror on American soil. Throughout his campaign, he sent the clear message that he was capable of restoring social order: “I alone can fix it.” Analysing campaign speeches, we found that Trump used far more threatening language than Hillary Clinton.To strengthen democracy, we’re going to have to deal with this threat psychology. Some of the threats, such as the loss of well-paid, secure employment, are real. We need to empathise with those who are struggling – rather than dismissing their fears – and develop innovative solutions, particularly for those put out of work by the decline of manufacturing amid the AI revolution.Now more than ever, we need to develop ways to counter the misperceptions that are beginning to upend democracies. We can’t take those fragile political arrangements for granted. It is not primarily a question of weeding out particular personalities or reversing regrettable decisions, but addressing the things that made them attractive in the first place: that pervasive sense of rising threat.• Michele Gelfand is a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Maryland and the author of Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110a530adca530cfe30a49df48fe0e012a36bb0e/0_37_1777_1066/master/1777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9f609e0b75387fe06c2a886c68975ed","title":"the guardian view on civil service reform a cummings plan","story":"Britain’s civil service is often depicted, in fact and in fiction, as an unchanging monolith. Yet for decades Whitehall has been an arena of repeated and often radical change. Governments of different colours – the Conservatives in 1951 and 1979, Labour in 1964 and 1997 – have come into office suspicious of what they saw as a kind of permanent Whitehall machine, dedicated to maintaining a continuity in policy which politicians are powerless to overthrow. Now, as a result of the 2019 election, Britain has another such government.Boris Johnson’s government will soon unveil its own plans for public sector reform. In an article on Thursday, the influential Conservative policy adviser Rachel Wolf makes clear that these are not intended to be cosmetic. Instead, Ms Wolf argues that changing Whitehall will be a major and radical focus of the Johnson era. Too much of the early discussion about the possible changes, she warns, has focused on a departmental reshuffle, with the Brexit department closed down, and changes affecting the Home Office, justice and international development.Important though such changes could be, Ms Wolf sees them as only a fraction of the larger plan crafted by the prime minister’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings. She thinks officials are “woefully unprepared for what is coming”. This larger plan, of which futuristic inklings can be gleaned from Mr Cummings’s personal blog, is focused on modernisation, systems and delivery. Some of its elements could include recruiting more science and technology graduates, making existing civil servants pass exams in data science and systems, and ensuring that officials stay in departments for longer than the current tendency to move on after 18 months.It would be easy, and to an extent understandable, to react to this radicalism with exasperation. After all, civil service numbers have been cut by a fifth since 2010. For some years, the 18-month merry-go-round between jobs has been one of the few ways to get a pay rise. And while some of the things that Mr Cummings wants to see on data, teams and openness are already established good practice, it is a huge ask to expect such a stretched system to deliver efficiently without substantial new investment.Yet it would be wrong to write off the government’s plans. First, they have not yet even seen the light of day. They should be read first, then discussed. Second, it is undeniable that the British state could do much better at delivering projects and systems on time, on budget and in a manner that puts the citizen first. Cost overruns, delayed implementation, poor productivity and inefficient delivery systems are not fake news. They are familiar realities. And, third, if the pressures for promotion, among ministers and among civil servants, are not restrained in a sensible way, then the long-term policymaking consequences for society are likely to be harmful.The Johnson government is entitled to confront these issues. It has promised more GP appointments, train lines and police officers. It is reasonable for it to ensure, as far as possible, that these pledges are fulfilled. In the now very distant event of a Labour government, the same would apply. That does not mean that the government must get a blank cheque. Some of Mr Cummings’ ideas are naively technophile. Others betray a starry-eyed faith in Silicon Valley management theory. The love of disruption responds to a genuine problem of inertia with what could become a destructive fetish. Yet Britain is right to expect a state sector that offers the public a good deal. That requires proper levels of spending. But it requires a lot of other things too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2b276e937f5e114b459628e4a523504a3b5ee/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f6c6c57529a11d2f43cd178605a0d1","title":"nationalism negative honest left progressive patriotism","story":"There have been calls for the left to adopt a progressive patriotism. But often this means ignoring uncomfortable truthsLast summer Stormzy bounded out before a huge crowd at Glastonbury in a union jack stab-proof vest designed by the British artist Banksy. During his headline set he showcased British ballet dancers, gospel singers and other grime artists and opened with a quote from a British MP. None of that was an accident. Stormzy is fiercely proud of his black British identity and the culture that made it possible. It is in every affect, from his diction to his dress.I doubt Stormzy would describe himself as patriotic. He’s certainly proud of who he is and where he’s come from, celebrating and embracing his own culture and community without denigrating others in the process. But enveloped in that appreciation is also a critique. His affection for what Britain might be does not blind him to, or silence him on, the reality of what it actually is. Even if you could sum that up in a single word, it wouldn’t be patriotism.Each points out theirs is not your common-or-garden patriotism. It “needn’t be rooted in nostalgia” (Healey), should avoid “immigration or citizenship policy” (Byrne) and be “internationalist” (Long Bailey). But ultimately they all smack of strategic desperation, ideological vacuity and racial pandering.The desperation lies in the post-election landscape. Patriotism is contingent on a nation to rally around. Ours is falling apart. Scotland has effectively become a one-party state dominated by Scottish nationalists in Northern Ireland, the Stormont assembly remains idle, Unionists feel betrayed by the Conservatives over Brexit and their MPs are outnumbered by nationalists for the first time. “There are two kinds of European nation,” the Danish finance minister Kristian Jensen once said, taking a sly jab at Brexit. “There are small nations, and there are countries that have not yet realised they are small nations.” We may well be about to get smaller. As a matter of sheer pragmatism, if I had shares in patriotism I’d be selling, not buying.But there are issues of principle here too. First, lest a battalion of straw men be hung at traitor’s gate, we must recognise that there is nothing inherently reactionary about people being proud of where they are from or what their ancestors did. We all come to politics with something, and identity – including national identity – can be an important place to start.Moreover, Britain has a fine radical and progressive history that should be more widely acknowledged. Some of it, like the NHS – an institution created by Labour, owned by us all, built and sustained in no small part by immigrant labour – is a progressive story hiding in plain sight. We need to tell ourselves a story about what it means to be British that is different from the dominant one. That story is not about the innate genius of the British character, but the resilience of British people who fought – often in small numbers and with little support – for equality and dignity. If that is what they mean by patriotism, then fine. But that is not what patriotism means. It carries the dictionary definition “devotion to and vigorous support for one’s country”. That often comes with flags, military parades and anthems – though it doesn’t necessarily have to.And in a period of Donald Trump, Brexit and the mainstreaming of fascism we would want to be careful about how we position ourselves in relation to rightwing nationalism. Some are putting kids in cages, ripping off headgear and defacing synagogues in the name of patriotism.That is not all it can be. “Despite the over-rationalised expectations favoured by the internationalist perspectives of the left,” argued the late Stuart Hall in Our Mongrel Selves, “nationalism is not only not a spent force. It isn’t necessarily either a reactionary or a progressive force, politically.” But it is much of what we are seeing at present.Which brings us back to Stormzy. What would these “progressive patriots” make of a young black man who personifies a positive story about what is possible in Britain, and articulates the banal if brutal reality that prospects for advancement among those who look like him are limited and the country is in denial about it? Would they hold him up as the trailblazing pioneer for an evolving and inclusive culture who would appeal to youngsters drop him as the foul-mouthed, race-baiting ingrate who talks down his country and scares their grandparents or would they hold him at arm’s length, happy for him to be seen, hoping he’s not heard?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f46e7b4a1d4c1aef94cc497f1c5906311ab69cc/73_0_5127_3075/master/5127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1eb89c76b1d7b1e543ce039549f4855","title":"new year resolution join labour party","story":"During my last advice surgery of the year, just before Christmas, and a woman walked in with her six-year-old son, who has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair.

I hope I’m up there with the best of MPs on how to get things done for their constituents, but I can’t conjure up houses. Last year my local council, Merton in south London, had 240 properties for 10,000 families on their waiting list, only one of which had four bedrooms. So it is unlikely that this family will move before the lad becomes a teenager. Sad to say, this is not the worst case I’ve had.It’s hard to work out which is. But a strong contender must be the parents living in a single room with their two boys of six and 13, the youngest of whom has not learned to walk, owing to the lack of space, leading to a diagnosis of “development delay”.The little difference I have made is often through help from local community groups and charities willing to provide support for some of life’s basics. But while what they do is great, and helps get families out of debt or provides a bed or a fridge, these groups can’t build homes. Only the government can make that happen.The public aren’t blind to this. Everywhere I go, residents talk to me about the state of the country and what can be done. I mean everywhere – in shops, at school gates, on the doorsteps and at bus stops. Even during a cold, dark election most residents kept me talking as the freezing chill swept in to their homes through their open doors as whole families struggled with their voting decision. Few willingly voted for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives, but many told me they couldn’t under any circumstances elect Jeremy Corbyn.We don’t need to overcomplicate this. The answer is simple, and more Labour MPs need to speak about it. We need the Labour party to get on the side of the people and become electable – but we can’t turn the Labour party around on our own because there aren’t enough of us.As we enter 2020, it’s time for people who can’t bear seeing young people sleeping in doorways or who believe that no elderly person should spend hours on a hospital trolley to get active.That’s why it’s time to make your new year resolution to join the Labour party, so you have a vote on choosing the next leader.

Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 19 AprilIt is well worth catching this intelligent survey of an artist who not only painted horses but flayed and de-fleshed them to know the science behind his art. The centrepiece is a superb showing of Stubbs’s drawings of the horses he dissected to research his book The Anatomy of the Horse. These are shown next to the preserved skeleton of an 18th-century racehorse as well as his famous portrait of Whistlejacket. MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, to 26 JanuaryThis delirious retrospective of one of Britain’s greatest modern artists is a fairground of surprise. As a young painter, Riley learned figurative skills but she found liberation in light when she studied the pointillism of Seurat. She took his optical experiments further in abstract paintings that manipulate perception, with lines that flow in waves and flat canvases that warp and wobble in space. Art that embodies the psychedelic 1960s. Hayward Gallery, SE1, to 26 JanuaryAs a portraitist Gauguin is a rum cove – did he love anyone except himself? After a brilliant survey of his self-portraits as a Christ-like visionary, not to mention the actual Christ, there are strange works in which he seems as interested in flowers and fruit as the people with them. It gets more exciting and moving when he sails for Tahiti whatever his faults, Gauguin’s empathy for the plight of Pacific people cannot be denied. The National Gallery, WC2, to 26 JanuaryLondon international mime festival is a season of vibrant visual theatre, including live art, circus and clowning. It is always hugely stimulating, full of acts to make the mind boggle. Highlights include mime artist Trygve Wakenshaw’s Only Bones v1.4 (Tue to 25 Jan) and Nick Lehane’s puppet piece Chimpanzee (21 to 25 Jan). Various venues, London, Wednesday 8 January to 2 FebruaryEverything that was great about John Carney’s 2007 film – the gentle romance and the sweeping score by Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová – has been honoured in Enda Walsh’s superb stage adaptation. The show starts out fairly low-key but morphs into a foot-tapping and heart-tugging night at the theatre. The touring production is directed by Peter Rowe but based on John Tiffany’s original concept and stars Daniel Healy and Emma Lucia. Fairfield Halls: Ashcroft Playhouse, Croydon, to 11 January touring to 25 JulyGrief tourism the insidious sway of social media the desire to be liked over the desire to be good. Dear Evan Hansen doesn’t sound like much fun, does it? But this is a provocative and strikingly modern musical, with Sam Tutty as a student embroiled in a web of lies, gossip and online spin. There’s also a catchy score from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriters behind La La Land and The Greatest Showman. Noël Coward Theatre, WC2, to 30 MayCharlene James’s unflinching play is a powerful piece about FGM told with such heart. It focuses on two teenagers, Muna and Iqra, both of Somalian origin and now living in Britain. The girls are friends but have very different ideas about FGM, a brutal ordeal both have undergone. This is a scorching play that will open your eyes to this awful ritual, still practised today. Stars Asha Hassan and Hermon Berhane. Royal Exchange Theatre: The Studio, Manchester, Thursday 9 January to 1 FebruaryIt is hard not to fall in love with aerial circus company Ockham’s Razor. Amid the skilful swinging, balancing and navigating the contraptions they build, the work is always warm, poetic and deeply human. This Time, part of London international mime festival, explores family relationships through the passage of time with a multigenerational cast. Shoreditch Town Hall, EC1, Wednesday 8 to 19 JanuaryDaniel Hay-Gordon and Eleanor Perry resurrect characters from the past in an indefinable performance that combines lip-syncing, queer culture and comedy with the rigour of two trained contemporary dancers.Sadler’s Wells: Lilian Baylis Studio, EC1, Thursday 9 to 11 JanuaryIt is half a century since Laverne Meyer launched a company of 11 dancers in a church hall in Manchester’s Moss Side.

On the small screen, the second season of Fleabag, HBO and Sky’s Chernobyl and the acclaimed dark comedy Succession are all frontrunners.After last year’s hosts, Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, avoided going for the jugular, this year sees the return of Ricky Gervais, who last commandeered the ceremony in 2016. The comedian has previously used the stage to ridicule many of the attendees and the awards themselves, joking that a Golden Globe is “worthless”. He has revealed that he plans not to let the current climate affect his routine this time around.“People like the idea of freedom of speech until they hear something they don’t like,” he said to the Hollywood Reporter. “So there’s still a pressure, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to water it down or back down and not say what I want.”Gervais has come under fire in recent years for transphobic jokes both on stage and on Twitter. Last month, he was criticised for a number of tweets attacking trans women, writing: “We need to protect the rights of women. Not erode them because some men have found a new cunning way to dominate and demonise an entire sex.”In the same Hollywood Reporter interview, Gervais reiterated that he isn’t transphobic but does believe that jokes about the trans community shouldn’t be avoided. “I can justify the jokes, but I get it,” he said. “Some people, when you deal with contentious issues or taboo subjects, the very mention of them is the sacrilege. That’s why they stay taboo. People straight away, particularly with a comedian, if you’re joking about a subject, they think you’re anti it as opposed to pro it.”Mark Ruffalo has tweeted his support for the shift, writing that the HFPA “should be commended for this and all the other awards shows should follow suit”.While the Globes has been seen as an important predictor for the Oscars, the voting base is made up of about 90 voters compared to more than 6,000 members of the Academy. Last year saw Green Book, Rami Malek and Olivia Colman win at both ceremonies.This year’s big screen acting categories are likely to produce wins for Brad Pitt as best supporting actor for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, Renee Zellweger for best actress in a drama for Judy and Adam Driver for best actor in a drama for Marriage Story. Jennifer Lopez and Laura Dern will face off in the best supporting actress category for their roles in Hustlers and Marriage Story, respectively.There was criticism following the announcement of this year’s nominations for the lack of female representation in both the best director and best screenplay categories despite acclaimed films from Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers) and Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood).“What happened is that we don’t vote by gender,” the HFPA’s president, Lorenzo Soria, said to Variety. “We vote by film and accomplishment.”The small screen awards could see Jennifer Aniston named best actress in a drama series for Apple’s critically isive The Morning Show while Phoebe Waller-Bridge is favourite to win best actress in a comedy for the second season of Fleabag.It’s also set to be a major night for Netflix, entering the evening with a record 17 nominations, including their first best picture nods.This year’s Oscar nominations will be announced on 13 January and the ceremony will take place on 9 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be77f3bd60f4f90c9ed0f96f1c1a0694f858b2c2/0_92_2747_1648/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb00f80e03e04a963a158b6f012fcd6e","title":"the stupidest thing humanity ever did to itself sam mendes and colin firth on 1917","story":"The director has turned his grandfather’s horrific memories of the war into a rollercoaster of fear and sacrifice – an antidote of the ‘chaos’ of directing Bond films When Sam Mendes was small, he would laugh at his grandfather’s habit of forever washing his hands. His father took him to one side. “It’s because he remembers the mud in the trenches,” he said, “and never being able to get clean.”Sam stopped laughing. He asked his grandfather, then in his mid-70s, to tell him more about the war. After five decades’ silence on the subject, “he finally cracked. And he told us loads and loads of stories, especially after a couple of rums. He was very theatrical and charismatic and Edwardian. He was also quite deaf, so he shouted them all.”Alfred Mendes was 16 when he enlisted, excited at the chance to serve in a good war that was going so well. When he got to the western front, “he just couldn’t believe what he found. His stories weren’t about bravery, but how utterly random it all was.” His small stature meant he was often chosen as a messenger. “That image of that little man, cut adrift in that vast, misty landscape, really stayed with me.”After the war, Alfred moved to Barbados, became a civil servant, wrote socialist novels and died in 1991, aged 94. At 34, Sam won the best director Oscar for his debut, American Beauty 20 years later, a movie inspired by Alfred’s stories may bag him another.The film, 1917, is Mendes’s first since Skyfall and Spectre and clearly intended as an antidote to 007. Both Bond movies were “chaos”, he says, making noises that indicate months-long logistical migraines, high-wire acts of placation and compromise.This film has one linear storyline and just one long shot – well, really a couple of dozen, invisibly stitched together by the cinematographer Roger Deakins. Two young lance corporals, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are hauled in front of their general (Colin Firth) and given a mission. They must shin up the dugout, race across no man’s land (mind the barbed wire, gunfire, rats, craters and corpses), along the (abandoned, probably) enemy trenches, through a French countryside strewn with booby traps, then find an adjoining battalion and tell them to call off their dawn attack as they would be advancing into a trap. If the pair fail, 1,600 men – including Blake’s brother – will die.Originally, says Firth, his scene was yet more brutal: as the boys hurry off to almost certain death, an orderly unfurls a white linen tablecloth for the officer’s high tea. That was scrapped. “The military establishment’s indifference to the wellbeing of these two young men was abundantly clear without that kind of emphasis,” says Firth, “or making it about the callousness of one particular general.“The mission the boys are sent on is one of brutal necessity, a tragedy compounded, of course, by the fact that the war itself was not.” Firth is only on screen for a few minutes, but filming even that short scene made him reassess his feelings. “One could empathise with the powerlessness and terror of young men who had no say in their fate, acting on decisions made by old men.”The tablecloth edit is a clever one. In its light-touch handling of the conflict’s class battle, 1917 distinguishes itself in its genre. “Once you start on all that,” says the films’ screenwriter, Krysty Wilson-Cairns, “you’ve lost most of your audience. And in Scotland, anyway, it means nothing.”Wilson-Cairns is a 32-year-old Glaswegian, perky in a jumpsuit. This is her first film. Her formative cinema experience came as a teenager in 2003: “I saw Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle and I was blown away. After that I knew I either wanted to be an Angel or to work in the movies. And Charlie wasn’t taking applications.”Her gender has raised eyebrows given 1917’s subject matter, she says, grinning, “but I somehow negotiated my vagina through it”. And she does suspect it means the stakes in the screenplay skewed differently: the aim is to get home, rather than to slaughter as many of the enemy as possible. “You’re not holding your breath to see if he will make the shot, but knowing that if he doesn’t, he’ll never see his family again.”One of Wilson-Cairns’s own grandfathers didn’t serve in the armed forces, but he was evangelical about educating Krysty about war. “He told me that understanding history is the only way to avert future catastrophe. The first world war was the stupidest thing humanity ever did to each other.“But although it was misguided, those men were also fighting for a free and united Europe. And somehow that’s under threat again, out of sheer madness and folly and political gain. Peace is so tenuous. I pray to God that we don’t have the same outcome.”Both she and Mendes separately say they want the film to act as a corrective to a repackaging of the war in the service of jingoistic isolationism. “People who are attached to some sort of nostalgic vision treat these wars retrospectively as triumphs,” says Mendes. “In fact, they were tragedies.“That kind of hijacking of shared cultural memories and pride is very subtle, and very easy to do. At the moment, it happens all the time. ‘We’re going back to being on our own again! This is the spirit that fought two world wars!’ That’s what we’re now lumbered with.”And while the volume rises on such dodgy tub-thumping, so the values that meant people were prepared to lay down their lives have been eroded, Mendes thinks it’s only extreme environmental activists who are today doing something analogous.“Sacrifice has fallen out of fashion,” says Wilson-Cairns. “The idea of having something above you, something to die for, is becoming an antiquated notion. People are inherently more selfish and more self-obsessed nowadays.”Mark Strong is among those actors – Firth, Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch – who pop up for cameos as the boys’ superiors bit parts whose starriness some have found distracting. Strong agrees there has been a slump in altruism. But that is chiefly the lookout of the institutions, he says, not the people beholden to them. “I’m not sure it’s an issue of no longer understanding sacrifice, but more that collective responsibility is giving way to protection of self-interest. Not just in Britain but all over the world, there seems to be a move to secede from the collectives that were created – for better or worse – after the two wars, whether Catalonia or Scotland or the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.” He gives Trump a name check, too not the most inspirational model of magnanimity.Both 1917’s leads say they hope they would do the same as their characters in the circumstances. Still: fingers crossed it’s not tested. If conscription came back today, says Chapman, “it’d be all over Twitter”.At 22, the former Billy Elliot and sometime Game of Thrones actor is the youngest and chirpiest of the cast – and the one least versed in the war before the shoot began. Making the film, he said, “I had so many reality checks: ‘Cor, have I got it easy!’” He read a collection of contemporaneous diaries between takes, and was especially taken by one written by a man who was in the calvary, shot in the hip and spent four days paralysed in no man’s land. “It turned out it was my great-great grandfather! He went on to work in the first poppy factory in Richmond.” Chapman is proud and awed, but hasn’t investigated any further.MacKay, 27, gentle and diplomatic, is wary of damning his – or any – generation. Our unfamiliarity with the need to give up everything is only for the good, he says. And how do you understand hardship if you’ve known nothing but comfort he talks about wanting to grow his own veg.“We’re less in touch with what really matters because we’re not being stretched. The film is about being at your absolute pits. You don’t want to be in a place where you only have what you need. But we’re perhaps rather too far down the other end of the scale and need to stop before we exhaust everything.”MacKay is 1917’s true breakthrough. Familiar from the likes of Pride and Sunshine on Leith, this film – plus Justin Kurzel’s upcoming Ned Kelly movie – should make him an A-lister. Mendes cast MacKay partly, he says, because his face and demeanour suggested old-fashioned qualities of dignity and virtue. MacKay couldn’t possibly comment, but says he based Schofield on his own grandfather, for whom he was named, and who was a man of honour and tact.In the film, neither Blake nor Schofield speak about their feelings they don’t need to – nor do they have time. Mendes was surprised, he says, at how many American viewers identified 1917 as a singularly English film because of this. “It’s about telling the truth in the face of great difficulty. The classic example is Brief Encounter a particular way of handling great emotion.”MacKay cautions against rose-tinting reticence. “Stiff upper lips can be very unhealthy. Denial is rarely good. But there’s a real depth of resolve to swallowing something for the now. There’s weight, like an ocean. Under the surface, there’s so much bottled that, when it does break, it’s bigger than those that break all the time.”Watching the film, says MacKay, “made it very clear to me who I want to come back to in my life, who means the most to me.” Usually, seeing yourself on screen isn’t easy, he says this is the first time he has been transported – thanks to the shooting style. “You take every step with those men. Making it meant a lot to me. But watching it did, too,” he says.And it is this coup de cinema which most marks out 1917 and makes it feel as uncomfortable, and as peculiarly modern, as László Nemes’s Holocaust drama Son of Saul. The audience is unable to look away or avoid the brutality. And while most first world war films are slow-burns of claustrophobia and paralysis, this is queasily kinetic: a horrifying rollercoaster taking you on a nightmarish heist.Yet not everyone has been convinced. Some reviewers have found the single-shot style too gimmicky an exercise for the sake of it, a display of technical prowess that distracts from the action. Mendes scoffs. “The camera never goes through a keyhole or passes through glass or follows the course of a moving bullet.” For him, it’s a cineaste’s complaint, not a concern for the punters.Deakins is downcast about the detractors. “It’s a pity,” he says. “Some people have told me they’re very aware of the camera.” He looks more hopeful when I wonder if it’s an old fogey issue. “I think the film will appeal to a younger generation raised on video games because of that more immersive feeling,” he says. “It’s not a piece of classical film-making.”Still, when a friend of Chapman’s told him it reminded him of a first-person shooter game, he baulked. “You control that. With this film, there’s no control. That’s why it’s so terrifying to watch: you can’t escape.”Wilson-Cairns is, characteristically, more frank. “The whole point of this movie was to live 115 minutes in someone else’s life. If you noticed the camera, we would all have failed. We didn’t make it so you would look at your phone. Or have it on in the background. Or so that someone somewhere would make a fuckload of money.”What she wanted above all, she says, was veracity. There are historical dramas whose primary duty is entertainment. She was unbothered by liberties taken in, say, last year’s Mary Queen of Scots: colour-blind casting, fact-massaging, anachronistic dialogue. Those weren’t appropriate here, she says. “We had to pay homage to the reality these men suffered through. We didn’t want to inflate it or deflate it. People lived this. It’s not a spaceship. It’s not a fantasy.”Deakins has a slightly different take. “It’s not naturalistic,” he says. “If you really showed what it was like, you wouldn’t have anybody in the cinema after five minutes.” Still, he was buoyed by Mendes’s backbone when they were shooting a hospital tent scene near the end. “He said: ‘We can’t pussyfoot around. We have to do it justice.’ I remember saying: ‘I think we’ve earned it. We should have, by this point.’”And what of Alfred Mendes? What would he have made of the film, of the upshot of finally sharing his stories? His grandson pauses. “I think he would have found it extremely uncomfortable to watch. But I’m sure he would have appreciated its existence.”• 1917 is released in the UK on 10 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9562757c45bc8c182f74466f6c34545503ece2e/0_52_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c45120efac6b237ca49824e6e60ee53b","title":"taco culture is blowing up how an la food writer became netflixs taco guru","story":"Javier Cabral has carved out a niche as the “token taco writer” and credits the Mexican dish with transforming his lifeJavier Cabral always dreamed of getting paid to eat. But he never imagined the job would require him to devour 36 tacos a day.This was the Los Angeles journalist’s life as a “taco scout” and associate producer for Las Crónicas del Taco (Taco Chronicles), a popular new Netflix documentary series on taco history and culture.“It would just be taco fucking ragers, taco binges,” Cabral said, recalling his early research for the show, which involved jam-packed trips to Mexico where he had a few hours in different regions, eating as much as his stomach could handle: “It’s like I was sweating lard.”The Spanish-language Netflix show, which features mouth-watering es into six different types of tacos, such as barbacoa and al pastor, is just one of many ways the dish has transformed Cabral’s life over the last year. The 30-year-old LA native and longtime food writer has also used his love of tacos to try to transform local media: in 2019, he became the editor of LA Taco, a hyperlocal news site that covers southern California culture, arts, news, events, and all things tacos, and aims to spotlight voices and stories often left out of mainstream publications.“The taco has really elevated my life and made me financially secure for the first time in a long time,” Cabral said one afternoon, while eating a tostada at Guerrilla Tacos, a restaurant that was one of two LA joints featured in Las Crónicas del Taco. “It took me awhile to accept the fact that I’ve become the token taco writer.”It’s been a long journey for Cabral toward his uniquely LA career, built on taco culture and recently culminating in the release of a Oaxacan cookbook with restaurant owner and author Bricia Lopez.A first-generation Mexican American, Cabral grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and east LA, and his parents often struggled to make ends meet. When he was in third grade, his family filed for bankruptcy and lost their home, forcing him and his siblings to live in the office of his father’s furniture store.In high school, Cabral became obsessed with the writing of Jonathan Gold, the late Pulitzer prize-winning food critic who was then at LA Weekly, the city’s alternative paper. Cabral often couldn’t afford to eat at the places Gold reviewed, but he would still diligently read him.“Jonathan Gold loved all cuisines of all immigrants,” he said. “I was just a punk rock kid. And what’s more punk rock than getting paid to eat?”At 16, Cabral emailed Gold out of the blue, saying something along the lines of, “‘Hi, Mr Gold. So, like, I’m in 11th grade and can’t find ‘food writing’ as a major anywhere. How do I become a food critic?’”The two communicated back and forth and, in 2006, Cabral started his own food blog, Teenage Glutster, which Gold later credited in a review. Cabral barely graduated high school, but Gold eventually became his mentor and secured a budget for Cabral to work as a restaurant scout for him at the LA Times.There were few Mexican American food writers at major publications, but Cabral built a name for himself as a taco expert. He had viral hits at publications like Vice, including one piece explaining why the tortilla quality in LA is inadequate and another defending the rise of $5 “fancy tacos”.In 2018, he joined Las Crónicas del Taco, recruited by Pablo Cruz, a Mexican producer and the show’s creator: “That just sealed the deal for the rest of my life.”Cabral was drawn to the idea of a food docu-series exclusively dedicated to tacos: “When he approached me, I was like hell yeah, let’s not have any talking heads, no egos. Just tacos.”His first step was creating a “taco bible”, a roughly 100-page manuscript featuring everything the Netflix team might need to know about taco history and detailing his travels to Mexico in search of the best tacos. Fueled by mezcal and pulque (Mexico’s oldest alcoholic drink), Cabral ate his way through the country, cataloging his journeys on Instagram (#TacosForPablo). He also has an impressive ability to retain information about food: “I can remember exactly what we ate five years ago, to the night. I’m really obsessed.”Some taquerias were wary, Cabral recalled: “People are really skeptical, especially if they hear me with a Mexican American accent … they don’t want to give away their recipes.” Others didn’t want attention, he said: “Taquerias in Mexico are very working class. Their number one demographic is their neighborhood around them, it’s not for Instagram or tourists.”The “bible”, a kind of taco encyclopedia which he plans to publish, was the foundation for the show’s six episodes on barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, tacos de canasta, guisados, and al pastor. It was key for the show to take place mostly in Mexico, he said: “We didn’t want to have the white savior complex. We didn’t want to have tacos be validated by the US.”Audiences were drawn to the show’s balance of offering “history for taco nerds” and “straight-up food porn”, Cabral said, and the reactions were overwhelming.He was especially moved by the praise from a woman who sells flowers in LA, who told him her seven-year-old son was no longer embarrassed to speak Spanish after watching the show, which will have a second season this year.“I know it’s just a taco show, but I feel like Mexican Americans often have this chip on their shoulder, an inferiority complex … of not being American enough, not being Mexican, and this show has helped people understand how to be more proud of their country, of their parents’ country, and just honor that part of their family,” he said.It’s the kind of mission that also drove his recent cookbook, Oaxaca: Home Cooking from the Heart of Mexico, co-written with Bricia Lopez, whose family runs the acclaimed Oaxacan restaurant Guelaguetza in LA. The book includes 140 recipes, celebrating indigenous cuisine, like the family’s pink horchata and mole negro.While wrapping the book, Cabral also stepped up to lead LA Taco, working to build a news site that highlights corners of the city that often go unnoticed, whether a secret backyard mariscos restaurant in Lennox, queer Latin dance classes in a Highland Park garage or a guide to experiencing Koreatown on foot.“LA Taco is like LA’s underdog publication,” he said, noting that the site has grown to attract roughly 1,000 members who support with monthly subscriptions. With smaller publications in the region shutting down at alarming rates, Cabral said he was eager to keep LA Taco alive and thriving. “We cover LA street-level stories … we’re still here and we’re as strong as ever.”Even when challenges arise, Cabral reminds himself how lucky he is to make money “fucking around on the computer” and eating his favorite foods: “I happened to be the right person at the right time. Taco culture is blowing up, and everyone loves tacos.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6979f4318783fa705864e7e6ee65fcd787a15086/0_83_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5db72157488e256e94285dc6a2297e8","title":"derby barnsley championship match report","story":"Wayne Rooney’s arrival at Derby might have looked like a gimmick but his debut proved he will be a telling influence in the Championship by inspiring his teammates with actions and words on the pitch.Although he had a hand in both goals against Barnsley his most obvious impact was as a leader. There was no power or pace to his performance, instead he relied on his guile, cunning and passing. Jack Marriott and Martyn Waghorn scored for Derby, either side of an Elliott Simões equaliser, with Rooney at the heart of both home goals.Before Marriott opened the scoring Rooney had lambasted the striker after two missed chances. A goal should have arrived when Waghorn broke down the left and provided a perfect cross for Marriott to convert from 12 yards but he lacked composure, sending the ball well wide.A sign of Rooney the coach came when Marriott fluffed his lines again, slotting wide after being sent through one on one. Upon the ball sliding beyond the post, Rooney berated Marriott, showing he is not just the star of the play but directing it, too. “Players miss chances but the way he was casual and lazy about the shot is why I said to him, ‘you have got to put it in no matter if you are offside or not’. Hopefully he won’t do that again,” Rooney said.The former England striker was deployed at the tip of a midfield diamond, sporting the captain’s armband previously worn by Richard Keogh who was sacked after a late-night car crash. Rooney is in Derby to provide a better example, with the most important arrival in the club’s history replacing the suspended Krystian Bielik.“A lot of people see him as a striker and a goalscorer but his vision of the game is excellent,” the Derby manager, Phillip Cocu, said. “I like the way he plays because he is not focused on himself but he also puts other people in good positions in front of goal. He played a great game.”Rooney proved his worth as a player when he whipped in a dangerous free-kick from a deep position for Marriott to make amends, erting the ball into the bottom corner after getting away from his marker for his first goal in 18 appearances.Barnsley created a rare counterattack five minutes after the break, resulting in Simões toe-poking home a rebound from close range after the original shot was stopped. It was a first professional goal for the striker who arrived a year ago from FC United of Manchester.Rooney should have scored soon after when he found himself unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box but he failed to make connection with his head and the ball bounced wide off his right shoulder. A number of crossfield passes were sent from Rooney to Andre Wisdom 40 yards away. In the 57th minute the ultimate aim was achieved when Wisdom controlled the ball, drove towards the box and pulled a pass back for Waghorn to steer into the corner to restore Derby’s lead.Rooney moved further forward after the withdrawal of Waghorn, sitting behind a lone striker as a No 10. The reason for changing his role was a simple one: the 34-year-old looked tired in the closing stages and pushing out of the centre allowed him to refrain from running as he eased himself towards completing 90 minutes.

This victory was more of a grind in the end even though Liverpool initially threatened a goalfest the game went quite flat for long periods, but a two-goal margin of victory did not flatter the home side and the overall significance lies in the fact that Jürgen Klopp’s players have now gone unbeaten in the Premier League for a whole year.Only Arsenal and Chelsea have managed that in the Premier League era, and no other top-flight side have made it through the festive period without dropping points.Liverpool faced lively opponents in Leicester, Wolves and Sheffield United, all teams in excellent form, yet each obstacle was cleared, with this third win of the series restoring a 13-point lead at the top of the table with a game in hand. Just about the only cause for optimism for those fearing the title race might be over already is that there has been a detectable fall-off in performance over those three matches. Leicester were stylishly routed, Wolves was a much more close-run thing and, while the outcome of this game was never in much doubt from the moment Liverpool took an early lead, after a bright beginning there were too many slack passes and wasted opportunities for the home crowd’s liking. If Liverpool are tiring, it proves only that they are human after all, though they might just have been managing a difficult situation. There was no need to expend unnecessary energy once in front and Sadio Mané’s second-half goal allowed everyone at Anfield to relax just a little.Liverpool got off to the best possible start with a goal in under four minutes. It was a classic quick strike with a minimum of touches, Virgil van Dijk picking up Andy Robertson’s run down the left and Mohamed Salah ready and waiting for the low cross to supply a crisp first-time finish and, though the margins were quite fine on this occasion, there was no need for VAR interference. Robertson had timed his touchline run to perfection to stay onside, though his job was made easier when the chasing George Baldock slipped on the turf, and Salah was smart enough to delay his move towards the ball until the moment was right.If that was not the opening Sheffield United had hoped for, it could have been worse still a few minutes later, when the lively Salah burst on to a pass from Jordan Henderson and brought a fingertip save from Dean Henderson with another first-time shot. With the visitors largely penned in their own half, Liverpool moved the ball around confidently as if putting on an exhibition. At one point Robertson found Trent Alexander-Arnold with a lofted pass from one touchline to the other, only for the right-back to send the ball immediately back in the direction it had come in an attempt to find Roberto Firmino in the penalty area.When Georginio Wijnaldum shot narrowly over from Sadio Mané’s pass midway through the first half there was a sense that another breakthrough might be imminent, though Mané chose the wrong option when Henderson ran half of the length of the pitch to release him, a slight miscontrol allowing the United defenders to funnel back and cut out his eventual cross.It was not quite all one way – Lys Mousset could have done better than shoot tamely at Alisson with an unmarked John Fleck calling for the ball at the far post – but United were indebted to Dean Henderson again when Mané nudged an Alexander-Arnold prompt into Salah’s path and the goalkeeper had to beat away a goalbound shot. Liverpool were at their most fluent when attacking at speed on the counter rather than attempting to pass their way through a packed defence. United knew that but were still obliged to come forward occasionally to try to get back on terms. Liverpool were not quite as sharp as they have been in recent weeks, with a few passes going astray and Firmino’s touch in particular letting him down in promising situations, and despite a wealth of possession in and around the Blades area they were unable to add to their lead before half-time.Firmino shot just wide at the start of the second half before Salah almost claimed a freak goal with an effort that trickled through a crowd of defenders and came back off a surprised Henderson’s right-hand upright. The goalkeeper saw the ball only at the last moment but acted quickly enough to prevent it trickling over his line. Mané’s goal, just past the hour, came from his own determined break down the right. He fed Salah in the middle and carried on running, so that the return pass found him in front of goal, where he was able to beat Henderson at the second attempt. It was a goal considerably less scruffy than it looked. Robertson’s initial pass to Mané was excellent, Mané’s intelligent run even better, and the coolness of Salah’s final pass almost sublime. He might not have meant to do exactly that, but it worked, and for Liverpool at the moment everything works and little else matters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96477acac0bc35d4fbe0e70aa7b2ac19f3fd0b2/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=767d6f50754844b9488f87440bc7b419","title":"fa cup third round 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Minamino’s Merseyside derby baptism, Woodgate’s Tottenham reunion and non-league Fylde take on Sheffield UnitedConsidering they have been fairly regular visitors over the years, Derby’s record at Selhurst Park is pretty miserable. Indeed in their past 15 trips – a run stretching back to 1983 – they’ve won only once. That victory came in 2002 when Georgi Kinkladze scored the only goal. A big-name, big-money player past his peak helping the Rams to an unlikely win in south London? You might be able to spot where this is going. Wayne Rooney made his playing return to English football on Thursday and logged a full 90 minutes in the 2-1 defeat of Barnsley, in which his free-kick supplied Jack Marriott’s opening goal. Two games in four days might be aa stretch for a 34-year-old who had not played since October but he could prove quite the talisman: while Derby’s record at Selhurst is poor, Rooney’s is not – he has never been on the losing side there. JA• Crystal Palace v Derby County (Sunday, 2.01pm, all times GMT)Alex Neil and Daniel Farke have at least one thing in common: both men know what it is to lead Norwich City through a campaign in the Premier League’s nether reaches and it is not quite too late, despite their recent results, for Farke’s current vintage to escape the fate experienced by Neil’s crop in 2015-16. They finished 19th that year and, towards the end of the following season, Neil would be sacked. Such is the style and verve Farke has brought that it is difficult to envisage a similar outcome a year from now even if they go down, but football moves in mysterious ways. To emphasise the point, it is not inconceivable Neil’s Preston side, only a point shy of the Championship play-offs even if their festive form was poor, will swap places with his former club in May. He has done an impressive job at Deepdale and it is easy to forget, given that his managerial career began in 2013, he is still only 38. He will fancy his chances of upstaging Norwich for one afternoon, at least: the Canaries have exited in the third round for six straight seasons. NAFylde may be the lowest ranked team left, but the National League side are by no means the poorest. Financed by local businessman David Haythornthwaite and based at the extremely well appointed Mill Farm complex near the Lancashire town of Kirkham, the Coasters are the envy of their non-league brethren and, like Salford City before them, have been accused of trying to buy their way into the Football League. Fylde’s detractors will be delighted to see that on the pitch this season things have been going rather less swimmingly. Dave Challinor was sacked in October after eight years in charge and while results briefly picked up under Jim Bentley, the club is in in danger of being relegated. Although a trip to Bramall Lane may prove a welcome distraction, getting a result against Sheffield United is likely to prove beyond these ambitious minnows. BGWhen the third-round draw was made at the start of December this tie smacked of a routine away win for the Premier League side. Tottenham seemed to have turned the corner, with José Mourinho’s first two games resulting in a couple of 3-2 wins. Middlesbrough, on the other hand, had just been hammered 4-0 by Leeds, a result that extended a dismal run of form to one win in 12 in the Championship and left them perilously close to the bottom three. Jonathan Woodgate was on the brink, with Neil Warnock reportedly being lined up as a replacement. A month later, though, Boro come into this tie on the back of four wins on the bounce and are beginning to ponder a play-off push, while Spurs’ Christmas hangover has included a draw at Norwich and a defeat at Southampton. All of a sudden this is not a trip Tottenham will be relishing. JAAlthough glamorous enough on paper to have been handpicked by TV executives for the Monday night slot on BBC, in reality Leeds United’s visit to Arsenal may end up being something of a damp squib. With his side leading the Championship at this time last year, Marcelo Bielsa sent a youthful side to QPR, where they duly lost. Leeds ultimately failed to secure promotion, coming up short in the play-offs but they remain in the box-seat to go up automatically at their second attempt under Bielsa. The distraction of an FA Cup run is one they could almost certainly do without and their manager is likely to pick his team for the Emirates accordingly. Following his players’ exertions against Manchester United, Mikel Arteta is also likely to pick a second-string side, although given the insatiable lust of Arsenal fans for the first trophy of the post-Wenger era, one suspects a win for whatever team Arsenal field will suit both managers just fine. BGWhile in a perfect, happy-clappy world, each and every team would do try their damnedest to win the FA Cup, the benefits of losing in the third round cannot be overstated for Premier League clubs with more pressing concerns. Seven top-flight teams came a cropper at the first time of asking last season and were duly rewarded with an 11-day winter break later in the month while their rivals prepared for and played in the fourth round. After the gruelling Christmas schedule, what manager wouldn’t fancy a period of recalibration in sunnier climes? While helpful, it is worth noting that these impromptu winter breaks are no guarantee of league success – of those seven top-flight teams, three were relegated. BGQuite a lot of water has passed under the bridge since these two last bumped into each other in the winter of 2008-09. That season featured two draws as Bournemouth (who were deducted 17 points after financial problems) finished 21st in League Two and Luton (deducted 30 for being in a right old mess) ended up dead last, tumbling into the Conference. Since those dark days both clubs have largely been on an upward trajectory (though not in the FA Cup: Bournemouth have been past the third round only twice since, Luton only once), one that has taken the Cherries into the Premier League and the Hatters to the Championship. But their engines are just beginning to stutter – away defeats five miles apart in London this week are reason for anxiety. Bournemouth’s 4-0 hammering at West Ham leaves them in the bottom three, while Luton’s 3-1 loss at Millwall left them holding up the rest of the Championship. So both teams need to balance the desire to keep players fresh for their respective relegation battles with the need for a morale-boosting victory. JASunday will mark exactly two years since Virgil van Dijk set a resounding tone for his impact at Liverpool. Van Dijk scored a last-gasp header to win the third-round derby against Everton at Anfield on his debut and, while the other end of the pitch is where he has helped change Jürgen Klopp’s team beyond recognition, as a way of gaining early favour it could hardly have been better. Takumi Minamino may not end up having as profound an impact on Liverpool’s entire balance but the former Salzburg schemer is likely to make his own bow. What were the odds of this tie being drawn again, and what price another arrival to remember? Minamino should be well rested, given his last action was on 10 December against his new club, but more importantly his performance in that Champions League fixture suggested he has the high-intensity style required to hit the ground running. If he can repeat Van Dijk’s impact, it could signify good times ahead. NA• Liverpool v Everton (4.01pm, Sunday)These days the FA Cup tends to mean tales of giantkilling derring-do from Mike Flynn and his Newport County side. It has also come to inspire heroics from Millwall, flying under Gary Rowett and currently sitting in the Championship’s top six, have reached the quarter-finals twice in the last three seasons Newport have beaten Leeds and Leicester since January 2018, also holding Spurs and giving Manchester City a game, so in theory it should not take too much for some blood and thunder to occur. Millwall’s unexpected successcomes at a price though, with Rowett likely to rotate, while Newport have not won in 10 League Two games and will prioritise their climbing into the play-off picture. “The league is our bread and butter, so I’d prefer to have another league game coming up,” their striker Jamille Matt admitted this week. His colleague Padraig Amond should be feeling hungry for more cup success though: Amond has scored in eight successive rounds, ning this season and last, and continuing that run would put him three short of Stan Mortensen’s all-time record. NA• Millwall v Newport (12.31pm, Saturday)On Thursday, Port Vale were held to a 2-2 draw at home by crisis club Macclesfield Town in League Two. On Saturday they travel to Manchester City to see how the other half live and, to make sure as many dyed-in-the-wool fans of the Potteries club as possible get their chance to attend, Vale came up with a novel tiebreaker when they received an extra batch of tickets. Those seeking a nibble at the increased allocation had to send in a 300-word mini-essay detailing how they have supported Vale over the years, and why they should be included in a ballot. Those who got lucky will dream that John Askey’s team can emulate a result from times past. Vale visited Maine Road on 4 November 1997and their 3-2 win is often cited among the depths City had to plumb in sinking to the third tier. The swing in fortunes seen since will almost certainly never be reversed but Vale, 10th in a ision whose wider financial troubles may only just be beginning, will appreciate the payday and if a few of those present 22 years ago got lucky in the ballot then it might rekindle a few fond old memories.

But does minimalism really make us any happier? By  Kyle ChaykaSonrisa Andersen’s childhood home was a mess. Her parents split when she was eight years old and she moved to Colorado Springs with her mother. Then she realised she was living with a hoarder. It might have been grief over the lost marriage that caused it, or maybe it was a habit that had grown worse as her mother’s dependence on drugs and alcohol intensified. On the kitchen table there were piles of clothes stacked all the way to the ceiling, things they would get for free from churches or charities. Furniture that Andersen’s well-meaning grandmother found on the street accumulated. An avalanche of pots and pans spilled all over the kitchen counters and floor. Anything her mother could get for free or cheap, she would bring into the house and leave there.As a child, Andersen kept her own space under control, but, beyond her bedroom door, the mess persisted. At 17, she left home, joined the air force and moved to New Mexico. Over time, her career took her to Alaska and then to Ohio, where she now lives with her husband, Shane, and works as an aerospace physiology technician. But the anxiety over her oppressive surroundings at home never left. Clutter was creeping back in, she realised, even though this time she thought she was fully in control.Andersen wanted all the things she had lacked in childhood, the comforts her colleagues and neighbours enjoyed. She wanted to be like the people in adverts, with their immaculate stage-set living rooms. Each new purchase brought a small dopamine rush that faded as soon as the thing was out of its box and taking up space. As she began to acquire more and more stuff and more and more debt, she began to feel as if she was falling into the pattern set by her mother.She went online for a solution. The search turned up blogs about “minimalism”: a lifestyle of living with less and being happy with, and more aware of, what you already own. The minimalist bloggers were men and women who, like her, had an epiphany that came from a personal crisis of consumerism. Buying more had failed to make them happier. In fact, it was entrapping them, and they needed to find a new relationship with their possessions – usually by throwing most of them out. After jettisoning as much as they possibly could, the bloggers showed off their emptied apartments and shared the strategies they used to own no more than 100 objects. The advice gained them large followings and they began soliciting donations or selling books. Presiding over them was Marie Kondo, a Japanese cleaning guru whose books were becoming international bestsellers. The principal commandment of Kondoism was to abandon anything that didn’t “spark joy” – a phrase that soon became familiar around the world.What the bloggers collectively called minimalism amounted to a kind of enlightened simplicity, a moral message combined with a particularly austere visual style. This style was displayed primarily on Instagram and Pinterest. Certain hallmarks of minimalist imagery emerged: clean white subway tiles, furniture in the style of Scandinavian midcentury modern, and clothing made of organic fabrics from brands that promised you would only ever need to buy one of each piece. Next to the products were monochromatic memes with slogans such as “Own less stuff. Find more purpose.” The trend wasn’t as subtle as its name suggested minimalism was a brand to identify with as much as a way of coping with mess.Andersen bought the minimalist books and listened to the podcasts. She removed everything from the walls of her home, cleared every surface and installed furniture made of light pinewood so that the rooms glowed in the sun. Without buying new stuff, the couple had enough money to pay off their bills and Shane’s student loans. Andersen felt a weight being released that went beyond the absence of clutter. She felt consumerism’s spell over her had been broken. “You don’t have to want things,” she said. “It’s a meditative thing, almost like repeating a mantra.”I met Andersen in 2017 in Cincinnati, where we were both attending a lecture on minimalism held at a local concert venue. We had come to see a pair of ebullient bloggers named Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who started calling themselves the Minimalists in 2010. Both had enjoyed six-figure salaries in technology marketing, but amid mounting debt and addiction problems, they hit the reset button, turning to blogging instead – blogging about how they got rid of everything and started over. The Minimalists self-published books and accrued millions of podcast listeners. In 2016, their documentary about minimalist practices across the country was picked up by Netflix. Most of the fans I talked to in Cincinnati cited the film as their conversion moment to minimalism.I had been tracking the rise of this minimalist movement and the style that it produced for a few years, but its momentum still surprised me. It was a new social attitude that took its name from what was originally an avant-garde art movement that started in 1960s New York. How could that have happened? Minimalism in the context of visual art was not particularly mainstream (certainly not on the level of Andy Warhol’s pop art) nor even well understood, all of 50 years later, and yet it was also a viral hashtag. There in Cincinnati were suburban commuters and retirees discussing how they had embraced minimalism. Millburn and Nicodemus told me that they had found fans as far away as India and Japan.Over the following two years, minimalism kept popping up around me – in new hotel designs, fashion brands and self-help books. “Digital minimalism” became a term for avoiding the overwhelming information deluge of the internet and trying to not check your phone as much. But when I caught up with Andersen, I learned that she had left her local minimalism Facebook group and stopped listening to the Minimalists’ podcast every week. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in minimalism any more. It had just become an integral part of her life, the basis for her entire approach to the stuff around her. She noticed it was sometimes more trendy than practical: there were people who liked talking about minimalism more than actually minimising, she said.On one hand there was the facade of minimalism: its brand and visual appearance. On the other was the unhappiness at the root of it all, caused by a society that tells you more is always better. Every advertisement for a new thing implied that you should dislike what you already had. It took Andersen a long time to understand the lesson: “There was really nothing wrong with our lives at all.”In the 21st century, across the developed world, most of us do not need as much as we have. The average American household possesses more than 300,000 items. In the UK, one study found that children have on average 238 toys, but only play with 12 of them on a daily basis. We are addicted to accumulation. The minimalist lifestyle seems like a conscientious way of approaching the world now that we have realised that materialism, accelerating since the industrial revolution, is literally destroying the planet.Yet my gut reaction to Kondo and the Minimalists was that it all seemed a little too convenient: just sort through your house or listen to a podcast, and happiness, satisfaction and peace of mind could all be yours. It was a blanket solution so vague that it could be applied to anyone and anything. You could use the Kondo method for your closet, your Facebook account or your boyfriend. Minimalism also seemed sometimes to be a form of inidualism, an excuse to put yourself first by thinking, I shouldn’t have to deal with this person, place or thing because it doesn’t fit within my worldview. On an economic level, it was a commandment to live safely within your means versus pursuing dreamy aspirations or taking a leap of faith – not a particularly inspiring doctrine.Minimalism, I came to think, is not necessarily a voluntary personal choice, but an inevitable societal and cultural shift responding to the experience of living through the 2000s. Up through the 20th century, material accumulation and stability made sense as forms of security. If you owned your home and your land, no one could take it away from you. If you stuck with one company throughout your career, it was insurance against periods of future economic instability, when you hoped your employer would protect you.Little of this feels true today. The percentage of workers who are freelance instead of salaried grows each year. House prices are prohibitive in any place with a strong labour market. Economic inequality is more severe than ever in the modern era. To make matters even worse, the greatest wealth now comes from the accumulation of invisible capital, not physical stuff: startup equity, stock shares and offshore bank accounts opened to avoid taxes. As the French economist Thomas Piketty points out, these immaterial possessions grow in value much faster than salaries do. That is, if you are lucky enough to have a salary in the first place. Meanwhile, crisis follows crisis and mobility now feels safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more attractive.Most of all, the minimalist attitude speaks to the feeling that all aspects of life have become relentlessly commodified. Buying unnecessary items on Amazon with credit cards is a fast and easy way to exert some feeling of control over our precarious surroundings. Brands sell us cars, televisions, smartphones and other products (often on loans that inflate their costs) as if they will solve our problems. Through books, podcasts and designed objects, the idea of minimalism itself has also been commodified.If I am a minimalist, then, it is by default. In the New York apartment where I lived while writing this, I could look around and count the objects that belonged to me. Not the couch, bed, TV, console or dining table, which came from my one roommate. Just a desk and a bookshelf that held most of the things I cared about: books, papers and a few pieces of art. Unless you are wealthy or creative enough to afford a lot of space, there are two responses to living in New York: one is overstuffing a tiny space that eventually becomes unbearable, the other is living like a minimalist. Without basements, spare closets or extra rooms to stash stuff in, you are always Kondoing.The great recession of 2008 also seemed to usher in a larger minimalist moment. An aesthetic of necessity emerged as the economy came to a standstill. Shopping at thrift stores became cool. So did a certain style of rustic simplicity. Brooklyn and Shoreditch were filled with faux-lumberjacks drinking out of mason jars. Conspicuous consumption, the ostentation of the previous decades, was not just distasteful, it was unreachable. This faux blue-collar hipsterism preceded the turn to high-gloss consumer minimalism that happened once the economic recovery kicked in, preparing the ground for its popularity.Dissatisfaction with materialism and the usual rewards of society is not new, but minimalism is not an idea with a straightforward chronological history. It is more like a feeling that repeats in different times and places around the world. It is defined by the sense that the surrounding civilisation is excessive, and has thus lost some kind of original authenticity, which must be regained. The material world holds less meaning in these moments, and so accumulating more stuff loses its appeal.I began thinking of this universal feeling as the longing for less. It is an abstract, almost nostalgic desire – a pull toward a different, simpler world. Not past or future, neither utopian nor dystopian, this more authentic world is always just beyond our current existence, in a place we can never quite reach. Perhaps the longing for less is the constant shadow of humanity’s self-doubt: what if we were better off without everything we have gained in modern society? If the trappings of civilisation leave us so dissatisfied, then maybe their absence is preferable and we should abandon them in order to seek some deeper truth. The longing for less is neither an illness nor a cure. Minimalism is just one way of thinking about what makes a good life.For some of its devotees, minimalism is therapy. The spasm of getting rid of everything is like an exorcism of the past, clearing the way for a new future of pristine simplicity. It represents a decisive break. No longer will we depend on the accumulation of stuff to bring us happiness – we will instead be content with the things we have consciously decided to keep, the things that represent our ideal selves. By owning fewer things, we might be able to construct new identities through selective curation instead of succumbing to consumerism.At least, that is the model popularized by Marie Kondo’s books, social media accounts and the instantly famous Netflix series that launched at the beginning of 2019. The KonMari Method, described in Kondo’s English-language debut The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, is curiously rigid, with a ritualistic appeal from the process of handling each item in turn and deciding if it stays or goes. Only by following Kondo’s disciplined tenets can the reader be fully successful. Despite her claims that everyone should find their own version of tidiness, she critiques those who follow “erroneous conventional approaches” to cleaning. One must begin with clothes, then proceed on to books, papers and household miscellany. Sentimental items such as photographs or memorabilia are last, because only by the end will you have built up the appropriate sensitivity to joy being sparked to evaluate such potent objects.Kondo promises the illusion of choice. You decide what stays in your house, but she tells you exactly how it should be folded, stored and displayed – in other words, how you should relate to it. When you pull everything out of its nooks and crannies, you realise just how much stuff you own, and how much of it you do not really need. It is like learning what actually goes into junk food: being forced to think about what you put into your life is enough to instill the habit for ever. Kondo boasts that none of her clients has ever relapsed. “A dramatic reorganisation of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective,” she writes. Readers trade the orthodoxy of consumerism for the orthodoxy of tidiness. KonMari might be vaguely anti-capitalist, but then there is the fact that you have to buy a suite of Kondo books to practise it. She has been fully transformed into a brand: her company now sells luxury Kondo boxes to organise your stuff in, certification classes for would-be Kondo acolytes and a range of crystals, as well as a “therapeutic tuning fork”.Minimalism was already being commodified when Kondo emerged, however. She was only the crest of a larger 2010s wave of writers adopting the idea. Her English-language predecessors emerged out of the online lifestyle-blogger community, with blogs such as Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist, starting in 2008 Courtney Carver’s Be More With Less, in 2010, and The Minimalists, who had already self-published their book Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life in 2011.The literature of the minimalist lifestyle is an exercise in banality. It is saccharine and predigested, presented as self-help as much as a practical how-to guide. Each book contains an easy structure of epiphany and aftermath, recounting the crisis that leads its author to minimalism, the minimalist metamorphosis and then the positive ways the author’s life changed. The books are often broken up into subheadings, and important phrases are bolded like a high-school textbook. Each one offers more or less the same vision as the others: “I don’t need to own all this stuff,” as Becker writes. Minimalism’s rewards are more money, more generosity, more freedom, less stress, less distraction, less environmental impact, higher-quality belongings and more contentment, as Becker reels off in a series of bullet points. The books’ sameness of content is matched by a shared design of visual serenity. Their covers are all soft colours and soothing typefaces, suitable for Instagramming – even if you don’t read them, they can still be inspiring. The serene covers of these books are just one example of how minimalism’s visual appeal makes its doctrine of sacrifice easier to swallow. Its aesthetic of fashionable austerity is like a brand logo. It is identifiable anywhere, and serves to remind us of the air of moral purity associated with simplicity, even if the minimalist product to be consumed has no moral content whatsoever.The KonMari Method and minimalist self-help as a whole works because it is a simple, almost one-step procedure, as memorable as a marketing slogan. It is a shock treatment demonstrating that you do not need to depend on possessions for an identity you still exist even when they are gone. But as Kondo conceives it, it is also a one-size-fits-all process that has a way of homogenising homes and erasing traces of personality or quirkiness, like the sprawling collection of Christmas decorations that one woman on the Netflix show was forced to decimate over the course of an episode. The overflow of nutcrackers and tinsel was a clear problem (as was her husband’s piles of baseball cards), but with their absence the home was sanitised and homogenised. Minimalist cleanliness is the state of acceptable normalcy that everyone must adhere to, no matter how boring it looks.The most famous proponent of minimalism – or at least minimalism as a lifehack – was probably Steve Jobs. In a famous photograph from 1982, Jobs sits on the floor of his living room. He was in his late 20s at the time, and Apple was making $1bn a year. He had just bought a large house in Los Gatos, California, but he kept it totally empty. In Diana Walker’s photo, he is seen cross-legged on a single square of carpet, holding a mug, wearing a simple dark sweater and jeans – his prototypical uniform. A tall lamp by his side casts a perfect circle of light. “This was a very typical time,” Jobs later remembered. “All you needed was a cup of tea, a light and your stereo, you know, and that’s what I had.” Not for him, the usual displays of wealth or status. In the photo he looks content.Yet the image of simplicity is deceptive. The house Jobs bought was huge for a young, single man with no use for that excess space. Wired magazine later discovered that the stereo setup resting in the corner would have cost $8,200. The lone lamp that illuminates the scene was made by Tiffany. It was a valuable antique, not a utilitarian tool.Not only is simplicity often less simple than it looks, it can also be much less practical than it seems. People often conflate the phrase “form follows function” – the idea that the external appearance of an object or building should reflect the way that it works – with the self-conscious appearance of minimalism, as in Jobs’s house or the design of Apple’s iPhone. But Jobs’s empty living room was not particularly usable. Instead of the mantra that “form follows function”, Jobs echoes a slogan that could be glimpsed not long ago in one upscale New York shop front: “Fewer, better.” Possess the best things and only the best things, if only you can afford them. It was better to go without a couch than buy one that wasn’t perfect. That commitment to taste might be rarified, but it probably did not endear Jobs to his family, who might have preferred a place to sit.Apple devices have gradually simplified in appearance over time under designer Jony Ive, who joined the company in 1992, which is why they are so synonymous with minimalism. By 2002, the Apple desktop computer had evolved into a thin, flat screen mounted on an arm connected to a rounded base. Then, into the 2010s, the screen flattened even more and the base vanished until all that was left were two intersecting lines, one with a right angle for the base and another, straight, for the screen. It sometimes seems, as our machines become infinitely thinner and wider, that we will eventually control them by thought alone, because touch would be too dirty, too analogue.Does this all really constitute simplicity? Apple devices have only a few visual qualities. But it is also an illusion of efficiency. The company strives to make its phones thinner and removes ports – see headphone jacks – any chance it gets. The iPhone’s function depends on an enormous, complex, ugly superstructure of satellites and undersea cables that certainly are not designed in pristine whiteness. Minimalist design encourages us to forget everything a product relies on and imagine, in this case, that the internet consists of carefully shaped glass and steel alone.The contrast between simple form and complex consequences brings to mind what the British writer Daisy Hildyard called “the second body” in her 2017 book of the same name. The phrase describes the alienated presence that we feel when we are aware of both our inidual physical bodies and our collective causation of environmental damage and climate change. While we calmly walk down the street, watch a film or go food shopping, we are also the source of pollution drifting across the Pacific or a tsunami in Indonesia. The second body is the source of an unplaceable anxiety: the problems are undeniably our fault, even though it feels as if we cannot do anything about them because of the sheer difference in scale.Similarly, we might be able to hold the iPhone in our hands, but we should also be aware that the network of its consequences is vast: server farms absorbing massive amounts of electricity, Chinese factories where workers die by suicide, devastated mud pit mines that produce tin. It is easy to feel like a minimalist when you can order food, summon a car or rent a room using a single brick of steel and silicon. But in reality, it is the opposite. We are taking advantage of a maximalist assemblage. Just because something looks simple does not mean it is the aesthetics of simplicity cloak artifice, or even unsustainable excess.This slickness is part of minimalism’s marketing pitch. According to one survey in a magazine called Minimalissimo, you can now buy minimalist coffee tables, water carafes, headphones, sneakers, wristwatches, speakers, scissors and bookends, each in the same monochromatic, severe style familiar from Instagram, and often with pricetags in the hundreds, if not thousands. What they all seem to offer is a kind of mythical just-rightness, the promise that if you just consume this one perfect thing, then you won’t need to buy anything else in the future – at least until the old thing is upgraded and some new level of possible perfection is found.Adapted from The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism by Kyle Chayka, which will be published by Bloomsbury on 21 January• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8cf2466113a3dfe43c0907add54ef10870e3b2f/0_1033_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38cdb0efc917eb62b60c915bd1d2b387","title":"female ultra athletes leading field women less ego","story":"From swimming the Channel four times to outrunning every man, we meet the women at the top of their gameAt the top of a wind-scoured hill outside Edinburgh, Jasmin Paris’s dog, Moss, patiently waits for his owner. He is, I think, wondering what on earth is taking her so long. The answer, I’m afraid, is me.We are in the Pentland Hills near her home – easy terrain for a skilled fell runner. For me, it’s a painful reminder that road marathons and track races do not help in the hills. I spend my clumsy descents looking at my feet, and each time I look up, Paris is defying gravity – not so much dropping as floating down.In January, Paris, then 35, made headlines across the globe when she won the Spine Race, one of those almost comically difficult events that sounds less like a run and more like a sadistic punishment: 268 miles, nonstop, along the Pennine Way. Paris took a week off from her PhD in veterinary science to compete, and thrashed every man in the field in the process.The race is billed as the world’s toughest endurance contest, and with good reason. It’s dark two-thirds of the time. Racers traverse the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Pennines and cross over Hadrian’s Wall to the Cheviots, sleeping only in snatches. Yet Paris’s time of 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds beat her nearest male rival by nearly 15 hours. And she did it while expressing milk for her baby daughter in aid stations en route – ensuring more than her allotted 15 minutes of fame when she crossed the line. But it’s a fame she clearly finds a little baffling: it’s a fair bet no one has taken up fell running in a bid to become rich or famous.“That last day of the race, in the Cheviots, was so remote and so, so beautiful,” she tells me. Where we are in the Pentlands feels fairly remote on a windy day, but it is only a bus ride from Edinburgh town centre. “I think I saw one person in about 10 hours. It was one of those mountain days that you remember for ever. I had stopped thinking about the outside world. It’s a simple existence: you put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Emerging from the darkness to what came after – the whole world seemingly wanting to talk to you – was such a stark contrast. But that wasn’t the reason I wanted to do it. It was a challenge, a personal challenge.” The thing is, I think that might be why she won.When it comes to speed, men will always be first across the line. No woman will outsprint Usain Bolt. No woman will hit the side of the pool ahead of Michael Phelps’s world records. Yet a remarkable phenomenon seems to have gathered pace over the past few years: the longer and more brutal the event, the more women seem to be winning outright, or surpassing men’s achievements.In September this year, the US swimmer Sarah Thomas (already holder of the world record for the longest open-water swim) completed another breathtaking feat of endurance. The Channel Swimming Association records 1,652 solo, observed, unassisted swims (no neoprene wetsuits or flotation devices) of the Channel since 1875. Thirty-four people have swum it there and back without stopping. Four people have swum it three times in a row (two men, two women). But only one – Thomas – has swum it four times. It took her 54 hours and 10 minutes, and though the crossing at its narrowest point is 20 miles, because of the strong tides pushing against her, she actually swam not 80 but close to 130 miles.This was despite battling nausea and throwing up everything she ate for the first two crossings. A day into her swim, she was almost ready to bail, but her team told her: just keep going. “So that’s what I did,” she said. “I swam until the sun came up and I started to feel better.”So what is going on here? Are we witnessing the beginning of a brave new world, or are these extraordinary women simply outliers?Those looking for a definitive scientific answer may be disappointed. Until about the age of 10, girls and boys are, athletically speaking, the same. Top running speed is the same for boys and girls, as is top swimming speed. Then puberty happens and testosterone changes everything. By 14, boys have bigger hearts, stronger arms, bigger shoulders, longer limbs, greater muscle mass. More power, and more speed, for life.However, when it comes to very long endurance events, the data is limited. While ultrarunning is experiencing something of an explosion in popularity, there aren’t that many 200-mile-plus races, and relatively few women are running them.So is it not possible that after a certain mileage the relative advantages that male hormones bring just, well, run out? The renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker is doubtful. He points out that the success rate among women in ultra-distance races is probably down to the fact that these are niche events – the tiny numbers of ultra-committed female athletes who do compete make any kind of analysis or extrapolation meaningless. However, intriguingly, he does wonder whether a woman’s body composition might prove to be an advantage when it comes to long-distance swimming. “The higher relative body fat percentage is probably enough to offset the differences in strength between men and women, particularly for cold water,” he says. A higher body fat percentage helps in buoyancy, which in turn reduces energy expenditure. It also helps insulate in cold water.Then there’s the theory that women do so well in ultra races because they are better than men at burning fat for fuel – making them more efficient. But if that were true, Tucker would expect the gap between the sexes to narrow as the reliance on fat gets larger – which doesn’t seem to be the case.“In running, from 100 metres to 90 kilometre ultramarathons, the gap between men and women doesn’t change,” he says. “That said, it could be that there is a kind of ‘inflection’ point where suddenly it begins to count. The data is just too thin to know for sure.”But if women win because of who else does or doesn’t turn up – how did Paris do so by such a margin? After all, when she won the Spine, the second-place finisher was Eoin Keith, a previous winner and the holder of the course record she smashed – hardly an average competitor. The answer may lie less in the body than in the head.Paris doesn’t run for prizes. She – like Thomas, who works for a healthcare company in Colorado – is an amateur, with a full-time job. If every single fell race in the country were called off tomorrow, she’d still be up in those hills every day. She tells me about holidays spent there in her late teens and early 20s with her brother. They’d pack everything they needed to be self-sufficient for a week, go to the remotest hills and hike, eat, sleep, repeat. She hasn’t raced a huge amount since January’s Spine Race, but in the summer she, her husband and a friend completed the Petite Trotte à Léon (PTL). Part of ultrarunning’s biggest event – the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) – the PTL is not so much a race as an endurance adventure. The 300km route passes through France, Italy and Switzerland, and includes 25,000m of ascent. “It was kind of a holiday,” Paris says, smiling.I suspect it’s not most people’s idea of a relaxing week. But it reminds me of a conversation I had with the cyclist Emily Chappell, who was the first woman across the line in the 2016 Transcontinental, and has herself been pondering the question of what can lead to women outperforming men.“I’ve got this bee in my bonnet about the current narrative for cycling – the male narrative,” she says. “A lot of it is about pain and suffering and the pain cave and the glory of pain and seeking out pain. Oh God, it’s so boring. So the working theory I’ve come up with is that people who do endurance sport are often people who have quite comfortable lives, and they are almost looking for pain elsewhere. I know it’s making generalisations, but what if men are looking for the pain they lack in life, and women are looking for the freedom?”It’s a persuasive theory. So many endurance events are marketed with a hefty dash of machismo – “tough” this, “ultimate” that, “warrior” the other. But is this constant reminder of suffering really the best way to approach an ultra event, when managing your head is as – if not more – important than managing your body? If you buy into this narrative that you are here only to suffer and endure, rather than have fun, then maybe those who start relaxed, looking forward to the journey, might have a head start.Perhaps this sounds a little woolly. But Thomas agrees that, for her, swimming is about freedom, not glory. “This is exactly me!” she says. “I don’t really care about racing and winning – I just like pushing myself. The long open-water swims make me feel free and strong. To look across the Channel and say, ‘I swam that’ is really empowering. I love being alone in a large body of water, knowing I’m relying on myself to make it through.”Sports psychologists also often talk about “the process, not the outcome” – enjoying, or at least staying in, the moment. Thomas clearly embraces this. “I was always weird during my competitive swimming days. I loved the training more than the racing,” she says. Perry believes this mindset can, perhaps contrary to expectations, create winners. “Something I see regularly with athletes is that when you are expected to do well, it adds a significant pressure,” she explains. “When there are no expectations we relax and can enjoy the process of seeing what is possible, rather than worrying about failing. These women may well see the event as ‘just a race’ in which they can see what is possible, rather than openly and loudly setting out to win it. This can be incredibly beneficial to performance.”Then there is the question of pride. Even when women do not win outright, they often perform better than men: better, in that a higher proportion of women finish ultra events successfully. And ego – or rather a lack of one – may be a key factor.Thomas agrees. “I think women do train harder, generally, and are less likely to wing something than the guys are,” she says. “I remember seeing something a few years ago that ran some numbers as related to speed. There are more guys who do longer swims, so there is a wider range of times, more variation. There are fewer women, but we seem to be more consistent.”It is backed up, too, by data from less extreme events. In marathon running, we know that women are on average better pacers. Not faster overall, just better at running evenly: less likely to go out too hard and “blow up”. And whether it’s 26.2 miles or 262, going out too hard can be the worst mistake you can make.But Thomas is not one to explore the theories. “I haven’t really looked into the science,” she says. “I just try to accept that my body is strong and can handle cold, no matter how much I hate my love handles.”Fortunately, hostility is the exception. Thomas points out that swimming has a longer history of equality than most sports. “Gertrude Ederle was the first woman to swim the Channel in the late 1920s, while the first female to run a marathon didn’t come along until the 70s. So women swimmers have a decades-longer tradition of being accepted than runners do.“I think most men are in awe of the women they swim with,” she adds. “They seem to accept that we’re just as tough, just as fast. That said, there are always exceptions. I have trained with men who think and act like they can beat me and get their feelings hurt when I pass them. I was sharing a lane with some guys a few years ago. When I was passing them, they tried to obstruct me. When I was getting out, two of them yelled at me for not being ‘respectful’ of their workout, never mind them being respectful of my workout.“And in 2008 or 2009, I outright won a 10k race. I passed the lead guy with about a mile to go and won by a couple of minutes. When we were done, I went up to congratulate him on a good race. He refused to shake my hand.”Paris has a similar story about a trail runner who wouldn’t let her pass him up a hill, despite clearly ruining his own race by speeding up too much. But she points out that generally fell running is democratic: “Here, you can have an elite runner and an 80-year-old in the same race, and we all have tea and cake together afterwards. There’s genuinely very little ego in this sport.”Where female winners often do encounter sexism, though, is in the reactions to their achievements. Thomas remarks that she’s constantly asked if she has kids, “with the assumption that if I did, I wouldn’t be doing what I was doing”. Paris says that she avoided looking too much at the comments under the articles about her victory.We also talk about Emelie Forsberg, a star of the ultrarunning world, with multiple wins to her name. Recently she had a baby with her partner, Kilian Jornet – himself probably the closest thing ultrarunning has to a household name. Forsberg was posting on Instagram about her return to competition in the Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC part of the UTMB race series), which would take her about 12 hours. Paris says she immediately spotted one reply asking: “When you run for 12 hours, who looks after your baby? Don’t you worry about her?”“She replied with four words: ‘She has a father,’” Paris says. “And I thought yes, that absolutely sums it up. It’s crazy.”And so, despite these amazing athletes conquering distances most of us would consider an effort in a car, there’s still a considerable way to go. But make no mistake, times are changing in the endurance game. And these women know better than most how to stay in it for the long haul.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).

Yes – if you follow this expert adviceI have some wonderful old friends whom I love and whose friendship I treasure. The problem is, I never see them. My old friends have become ghost friends: I know there is something there, but nothing is tangible. Somehow, life has come between us. I would love to see them, but is it possible to salvage lapsed friendships when they have been dormant for a year – or several years? (I hope so, because I have a wedding present that I would like to give a friend before her third anniversary.)There are all sorts of obstacles to keeping friendships active, according to Gillian Butler, a fellow of the British Psychological Society. She rattles off family commitments, work, geographical distance and major life changes. “But there’s another impediment, which is that we feel embarrassed, ashamed or upset that we’ve let somebody drop,” he says. “It gets in our head that maybe they wouldn’t want to see us.”Unfortunately, those feelings often overpower our desire to reach out. But if you would like to rekindle a lost friendship, why not seize the moment? I will try if you try.Butler suggests beginning with a broad mind. “Maybe some of the impediments are about assuming it’s got to be a one-to-one friendship,” Butler says. She revived a ghost friendship of her own after her husband and daughter bumped into Butler’s long-lost friend. “Immediately, she was absorbed into the current situation of our children, all the changes that had happened since we last met. That gave us a new lease of life,” Butler says. It didn’t matter that the two of them couldn’t always meet alone. Their friendship had been broken by a 15-year gap, but the gap closed. That was 20 years ago, and they have been friends (again) ever since.If you are too busy to fit in any extra social life around the demands of your job or childcare, Butler thinks it will suffice to “keep a link warm with occasional contact”, so that later, when life permits, you can invite your friend out and make the shift from contact to activity.Just be wary of relying on social media to keep that link warm. Louise Tyler, a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, thinks that “liking the odd Instagram or Facebook post can give a false sense that you’re connecting with friends … The ease of it means that people aren’t willing to put in the effort. But it’s no substitute for face-to-face conversation, laughter or even tears.”Really good friendships have an emotional longevity that makes them resilient to dormant periods, even very long ones. “Old friends have seen each other grow up they understand your history, your challenges, your family background, your relationship history,” says Tyler. On top of that, “nostalgia is known to increase feelings of social connection”, so, when you manage to meet up, the chances are you will really enjoy it.Right. Are you ready to try? Tyler advises picking up the phone or sending a text rather than an email, which she thinks is too easily lost in an inbox. (I am a social coward, so I am sticking with email.) Whichever medium you choose, make sure you don’t start with an apology. “It’s hard to make contact without apologising,” Butler says. “But ‘I’m sorry’ is never very inviting.”Tyler also advises avoiding “long and convoluted stories about what happened”. Keep the message short. Be direct. Say you have been thinking about them. After all, this is true. Tell them simply that life got in the way and you would love to see them.If you receive a reply, your mission is almost complete. But there is one last pitfall. If you find yourself typing the words “We must meet up”, delete them immediately and replace them with a specific suggestion. Considering all that has gone before, you need to do more than express an intention or desire. You need to make it happen.I am seeing my friend soon. It has been nearly three years and I can’t wait.

Here’s how to resolve it once and for allIf you have been in a relationship for a year or more, you will know exactly what “that argument” is. It is the one that keeps going round and round, always ending where it started.“You never pick up your dirty clothes, even though you know it drives me crazy.” “You’re always late, even when I remind you how much it matters to me.” And so on.But you don’t have to go on like this. There are a number of ways to stop – or at least control – the endless bickering. Take a look at the disputes one by one, so you can choose the most suitable way to neutralise your own argument and, as a bonus, improve your relationship.Before you start, though, you must answer an important question. I would suggest you and your partner answer it separately, then compare your answers: “If you weren’t arguing about X, what would you enjoy doing instead?”The answer is critical, because if you can’t come up with anything much, you won’t have enough incentive to break your unhappy habit. If you both come up with some suggestions, that is great news: start building them into your schedules right away. If you drew a blank, think back to when you first met. What did you enjoy doing then that you could build into your relationship today? Find a way to do so.Once you take this positive step, you will notice things starting to improve, because the more time you spend having fun together, the less time – and less incentive – you have to argue. Yes, you will probably still have the argument, but hopefully a bit less often, because we haven’t yet tackled it. This is the next task.Here are six techniques to consider.Maybe your partner doesn’t want to work on this problem. Maybe you just want to get on with other things yourself. If so, the DIY approach is for you. All you have to do is make up your mind to stop caring about whatever has been annoying you. You can do this if you will accept that your partner’s behaviour is not the problem the real problem is that you allow yourself to become irritated by that behaviour. Kahlil Gibran explains this elegantly in The Prophet when someone in the audience asks him how to become free of negativity: “If it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you. And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.”Adopting the DIY approach involves a change of attitude. What your partner says or does is no longer critical. How you react is what matters now – and that is entirely up to you.Of course, letting go like this is much easier said than done, particularly if your argument is well-entrenched and if the topic concerns something deeply important to you. If that is the case, you may want to try one of the other techniques, either alone or in combination with this.Often the content of the argument is a cover for a more fundamental difference. In my clinical experience, couples argue about four main issues: a perceived imbalance of powerlack of reciprocity lack or loss of trust lack or loss of respect or lack of understanding about differing needs for space and independence.If you want to get to the bottom of what you are arguing about, uncovering that fundamental difference is your task. Because of the strength of the emotions involved and the feelings of vulnerability that are bound to arise, this is hard to do without the presence of a trusted, experienced third person. If you want to take this approach – and it is a good one, because it may well prevent new versions of the argument from springing up – I suggest you sign up for some sessions with a recommended couples’ therapist.Therapists often use this technique, in which permission is given to have the argument, but only at set times and for a set duration (preferably not just before bedtime). For example, you can argue, but only between 7pm and 7.30pm on Mondays and Thursdays.Usually, the couple find this so artificial that they feel less like arguing and more like laughing at something that, having had time to cool down, seems rather trivial.This approach is based on behavioural marital therapy (BMT), a type of therapy popular in the 70s and early 80s. Each partner defines a behaviour they find irritating in the other (focusing on the content of the argument in question) and suggests an alternative positive substitute. Then, whenever the argument crops up, each partner agrees to behave in the positive manner instead of arguing. Although a number of studies showed BMT can produce specific behavioural changes, Matthew Sanders and colleagues at the University of Queensland reviewed the relevant literature and concluded that, despite this, the relationship doesn’t usually improve overall. So, this option is one to try if you wish to eliminate a specific argument and don’t mind if nothing else changes.Whenever emotions dominate, we start thinking in black and white. In other words, we assume there are only two solutions to any problem: either I am right or you are right. In truth, however, there are many possible solutions. When we are feeling calm and rational, it is easy to see that.So, to deal with your argument more rationally, begin by agreeing to call time immediately whenever you start arguing. Then, wait at least 20 minutes – the time it takes for emotions to settle so reason can reassert itself. You can make it even more likely you will calm down if you spend that time doing something you enjoy, on your own. After this time apart, sit down together. Each of you must come up with five ways the other could behave or react that wouldn’t feel upsetting (and might even feel good). Talk these through until you reach a compromise.This technique is borrowed from parenting literature, because it is a great way to sort out arguments between siblings. It doesn’t guarantee you will not create another argument, but it means you have a strategy for dealing with it if you do.I have saved this technique for last because it is my favourite. It requires effort, imagination and some acting skill, but it is worth it. Not only can the debating game sort out your differences, but it also deepens empathy, a quality that will positively affect all your relationships.Instead of waiting for the argument to surface, choose a time when you are both calm and reasonably rested. Find a quiet, comfortable spot and deliberately call the argument to mind. You must now change places – that is, each must imagine their partner’s point of view. Argue from the other side, say for 10 minutes, or until you feel you have covered all angles. Finally, tell your partner what you have learned. Now that you understand their point of view more clearly, offer new and better ways to respond the next time the argument resurfaces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d63ef1566b7cff5be1190f47bc6a0ec8f712b4/0_490_1239_743/master/1239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac50e0307639487894fa0a06195b6baa","title":"living too much in future expense of now","story":"The question implicit in many people’s early January ponderings is essentially this: how do I – or how should we, collectively – plan to use the coming year? Your answer might involve getting fit, or finding a soulmate, or making a million dollars selling virtual kale snacks online to idiots. Or it might focus on activism, or just on getting by, and staying moderately sane in trying times. But it’s worth noting that all these different goals share the same underlying assumption, one so basic it’s easy to miss: that time is best approached, in the first place, as something you use.But is it? The problem with treating every year (or week, or hour) as something you’re supposed to put to use is that you end up living permanently focused on the future. The more strenuously you try to get something out of life, the more emotionally invested you become in reaching the point at which you’ve succeeded in doing so – which is, necessarily, never now. In other words: try too hard to make life meaningful, and it becomes impossible to derive any meaning from your present-moment life.John Maynard Keynes articulated the matter well in a famous 1930 essay (in which he did, admittedly, also claim we’d only be working 15 hours a week by this point in history). “The ‘purposive’ man,” he wrote, “is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat’s kittens nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on forward forever to the end of cat-dom.” The upside of this attitude is that you get to feel more in charge of your life the downside is that you never really get to enjoy it.Certain spiritual teachers, adherents of the philosophy known as “non-duality”, would go further. They’d claim that the whole idea of “using time” is based on an illusory separation between “you” and the time you’re attempting to use. From your first-person perspective, all there is at any given moment in time is just whatever you’re experiencing: a tingling in your leg, the sight of your kitchen table, the car alarm going off outside, a vague irritation at being asked to contemplate these kooky New Age ideas.

In this small and sweaty venue, a Swedish heavy metal band are opening their set with a song about the exploits of Field Marshall Rommel’s infamous 7th panzer ision in the second world war. They follow it with a number about the horrors of Passchendaele in the first world war.By the end of the night, we will have had exuberant hymns to Lawrence of Arabia, an all-female Soviet bomber squadron and the military genius King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Everyone in the room, the vast majority of whom are wearing Sabaton shirts, sings along with absolutely everything. Meanwhile, the venue gently rocks from side to side, because we are on a ship in the middle of the Baltic Sea.Welcome to the 10th annual Sabaton Cruise: The Battleship, where passions for military history and Olympic-standard drinking collide. Sabaton may be an unfamiliar name to non-metalheads, but they won’t be for long. Other than veterans Iron Maiden, they are the biggest heavy metal band in Europe. Their last album, The Great War, reached No 1 in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland and No 11 in the UK – very respectable for a heavy metal band.What’s more, the band have made significant inroads into the notoriously Euro-phobic US rock market. In addition to their annual cruise (which has sold out every time), they have also been running their Sabaton Open Air festival in their home city of Falun, in central Sweden, since 2008, and have their own history channel on YouTube, where the stories behind their military history-themed songs are explored at length by academics and historians. Every diehard fan crammed into the ship’s mini-theatre has completely bought into the whole thing. The response, as Sabaton conclude the show with pummelling metal jig Swedish Pagans, is deafening and utterly joyful.The following morning, swarms of brutally hungover fans stagger chaotically towards the ship’s buffet restaurant for sustenance. Others stumble out on deck into sub-zero temperatures for a fag. Everyone seems to have survived the night without falling overboard. For all heavy metal’s reputation for rowdiness, the Sabaton cruise has a lovely family vibe – Mikael, from Stavanger, in Norway, tells me he fell asleep in one of the restaurants, but was helpfully carried to his cabin by some Germans. With a Sabaton quiz, heavy-metal karaoke and a merchandise stall selling a bewildering number of items for all sizes, genders and tastes, it all feels very inclusive and cosy. The band’s obsession with war stories ensures that we are all learning something, too.“Every school system I’ve ever encountered has been very effective at turning something interesting, like history, into something boring,” says Joakim Brodén, the band’s mohawked, musclebound frontman. “Of course you have to learn facts and figures, but that can be so boring. If you zoom in and tell stories, like the tale of Witold Pilecki, a guy who went voluntarily to infiltrate Auschwitz and support the resistance? These are human stories – people from every nation and every culture can relate to them.”The band love military history so much that when they heard that a museum on the site of the UK’s only first world war battle was in financial trouble – Heugh Battery Museum in Hartlepool – they created a special T-shirt design and raised £4,000.As educational as their songs are designed to be, Sabaton are aware that their obsession with military events, and the grimmest aspects of war, could be misconstrued as ghoulish, flippant or possibly even politically dubious. There’s no doubting that the band’s motivations are entirely honourable, but Brodén does say they have to remain mindful of the emotional power of these tumultuous tales. “We played the song 40:1 on the battlefield in Wizna, Poland, exactly 70 years after the battle of Wizna happened,” he says. “We had the Swedish ambassador there and 10,000 fans, and we were in the field where it actually happened – you could see the fire, literally, in the fans’ eyes. Those songs are often the most fun but they can be a little scary, too. We’re singing about military history because it’s fascinating. We’re not pushing nationalistic propaganda.”Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström are the sole remaining members of the original Sabaton lineup, and have nurtured their band over two decades: Brodén writes the music, while Sundström seems to be responsible for everything else. Aside from being Sabaton’s manager, he books their shows and deals with logistics, stage sets and a steady stream of new projects he can’t stop dreaming up. “Nobody tells us when or where to play, how to build a stage, how to do accounting,” he says. “Give me a problem to solve and some tools – and I’ll find something I can build with them. I’ll want to build something bigger than everything else.”This includes the Sabaton History channel. Sundström’s piercing blue eyes light up as he explains the thinking behind it. Conceived to flesh out the military stories behind the band’s songs, each episode has led to a surge in streams and album sales. “It’s definitely not paying off in terms of direct income, but not everything needs to do that,” he says, adding that they are turning their website in “an encyclopaedia of military history. You can see how each day in history relates to Sabaton. So you can read about it, watch it, listen to it – we’ll get you one way or the other!”On board the “battleship” (in reality a standard cruise ship, albeit a huge one), there is plenty of evidence that Sabaton’s remorseless pursuit of new ways to attract fans has led to the creation of a genuine community. Up to 40 different countries are represented among the cruise’s 3,000 punters, and Brodén seems thrilled to have brought so many people together. “The Polish fan club started hanging out with the German fan club and so on. I must’ve bumped into 100 people I recognised yesterday.”Several unexpectedly successful tours in the US disproved the notion that, as Sundström claims to have been repeatedly told, “Americans don’t like power metal”. But even within metal circles, the Swedes have seldom been favoured candidates for world domination. Sabaton albums have generally been greeted with an appreciative but noncommittal shrug from the rock and metal press. So-called “power metal” – a brightly melodic and fast-paced strain of old-school metal – has never sought to be cool, and is easily ignored. But while many younger, ostensibly cooler bands have risen and fallen, this defiantly traditional quintet have marched stoically onwards, oblivious to time or trends but dragging a phenomenal number of people along with them.“It’s always been a steady, upward march. We’ve never had a moment where we’ve lost our footing,” Brodén notes, almost sheepishly. “For me, personally, I had one ‘What the fuck?’ moment in Athens in 2009. We were playing in an underground club, not a huge show, and I think we were playing Ghost Division. Suddenly, everything went into slow motion. I realised, ‘Hmm, I’m in Athens having a good time, playing a show, and I haven’t done anything else for the past two years. I guess I’m a professional musician!’”“We were never welcomed into the music industry, especially in Sweden,” adds Sundström. “We are the outsiders, the ugly guys that they don’t want at their parties. A lot of people thought they could ignore us and we’d go away, but they were wrong. Now they have a big problem because they have to write about us and we’re selling their magazines, but they missed the boat, so to speak.” He hoots with laughter.The ship is heading back to Stockholm and Sabaton are bringing the cruise to a close with a second lengthy set full of songs of heroism, bravery, tragedy and horror, with historically pertinent visuals blazing from screens behind them. The band are clearly having as much fun as the fans, despite being (we assume) considerably less inebriated. The last song, To Hell and Back, is a blistering paean to the poetry of US veteran and actor Audie Murphy and goes down so well it nearly sinks the ship. Brodén and Sundström bump fists and hug as the diehards chant their band’s name.“Our music and our lyrics speak the same emotional language,” says Brodén. “In metal, the spectrum can be anything from hatred and aggression through to happiness, joy and pride. That’s all in this music already – and these military stories have it all, too. We didn’t realise it at the beginning, but mixing those two things up was a fucking slam dunk!”• Sabaton play Wembley Arena, London, on Saturday 8 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52463ecfee14434bcd49d3ee116eaee9ca82221d/0_611_1181_708/master/1181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a85f0f5f4bd469b00d2c525a028c8a6 620w","title":"dominic cummings calls for weirdos and misfits for no 10 jobs","story":"Boris Johnson’s chief adviser touts for ‘unusual’ applicants outside of the Oxbridge setDominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, has written a rambling blog calling for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for new jobs within No 10.In a move way outside the usual recruitment procedures of Whitehall, the key architect of Johnson’s election victory has outlined a set of “unusual” qualities he wishes to see in applicants in the blog post which runs to nearly 3,000 words.A lucky junior applicant will be chosen to be his personal assistant, he added.The move will be seen as part of the new Conservatives’ plans to shake up central government and break up the civil service’s alleged stranglehold over policy.In one section, Cummings wrote that he wanted to bring in “super-talented weirdos” with “genuine cognitive ersity” and avoid senior civil service applicants with Oxford and Cambridge English degrees.“We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole, weirdos from William Gibson novels like that girl hired by Bigend as a brand ‘iner’ who feels sick at the sight of Tommy Hilfiger or that Chinese-Cuban free runner from a crime family hired by the KGB.In another section, Cummings also appeared to indicate that he wanted to hire recent graduates in economics. “You should a) have an outstanding record at a great university,” he said, but did not say if this would exclude those who had studied at Oxford or Cambridge.Cummings told potential applicants that the government’s large majority means that it can take unpopular risks that others have had to avoid.“Now there is a confluence of: a) Brexit requires many large changes in policy and in the structure of decision-making, b) some people in government are prepared to take risks to change things a lot, and c) a new government with a significant majority and little need to worry about short-term unpopularity,” he said.Applicants are instructed to send a one-page email outlining their ideas to an unofficial account - ideasfornumber10@gmail - with the subject line “Job”.He wrote: “We want to hire an unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds to work in Downing Street … The categories are roughly: data scientists and software developers economists policy experts project managers communication experts junior researchers one of whom will also be my personal assistant weirdos and misfits with odd skills,” he wrote.In the section seeking his personal assistant, he warns the would-be applicant would need to make sacrifices in the role. Cummings warned: “You will not have weekday date nights, you will sacrifice many weekends — frankly it will be hard having a boygirlfriend at all.“It will be exhausting but interesting and if you cut it you will be involved in things at the age of 21 that most people never see.”Cummings added that he did not want to hire “confident public school bluffers” in the role.Described as a “mad professor” and an “evil genius,”, Cummings ran the Vote Leave campaign and is credited with creating the “take back control” and “£350m for the NHS” slogans.But he has clashed with officials and Tory grandees in the past, and has not held back with his opinions on other high-profile Brexiters such as David Davis, whom he once labelled as “lazy as a toad” and as “thick as mince”.He was played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a film about the 2016 referendum called Brexit: The Uncivil War.The post was launched after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their jobs.Under “seismic” changes being planned by No 10, she also said that civil servants are “woefully unprepared” for sweeping reforms.Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, which represents senior civil servants, warned that the PM’s allies are exhibiting a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the modern civil service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75d979e61e6b55514d4aa25b9fcf460792fce53/0_426_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82c72e142c9898ca25ea4985d297a5e","title":"if you speak multiple languages which words get lost in translation","story":"Share your favourite words or terms that just don’t translateA new study has demonstrated that while words for emotions such as “fear”, “love” or “anger” are often directly translated between languages, there can be differences in their true meaning, depending on the family the language belongs to.For example, while the concept of “love” is closely linked to “like” and “want” in Indo-European languages, it is more closely associated with “pity” in Austronesian languages.The team behind the research say the way particular experiences are interpreted as emotions appears to be shaped by culture.Are there words you know which can be directly translated, yet have subtle differences in meaning?

We’re increasingly experiencing unseasonal heatwaves, dangerous flooding and extreme weather,” explains WWF climate change specialist, Isabella O’Dowd. “The government, businesses and iniduals have an important role to play in reaching the UK’s climate change targets. Right now, people want to know what they can do to help mitigate the effects of climate change.”In the past year, the climate crisis has shifted from 11th place to third place on the list of people’s concerns in WWF’s monthly public opinion poll, just behind the NHS and Brexit. This year has also seen high-profile global youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report stresses that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in all sectors, including land and food. As a result, more people recognise that climate breakdown isn’t abstract. It’s not a threat affecting remote communities, or far away in the distant future – it’s happening here and now.The climate and nature crisis is already accelerating so many human-induced influences on our planet – from the destruction of vast areas of rainforest in the Amazon to the collapse of bee populations. As more species become endangered, including one-third of all insects globally, the ecosystems that we all rely on become more fragile.With such astonishing loss of bioersity and habitat, planet Earth is much more likely to reach irreversible tipping points. Environmental breakdown is inevitable if we continue this unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels.Mark Wright, WWF’s director of science, hopes that environmental issues will be at the top of the agenda for political leaders: “Attitudes are shifting and now we need a step-change – the UK government needs to take radical steps to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”WWF climate experts estimate that net-zero could be achieved much sooner than the current 2050 target if we act now, but that calls for fundamental changes to the UK’s outdated energy infrastructure. Historically, the UK has been one of the biggest emitters and has an important role to fully decarbonise our energy system as quickly as possible. We need to make the energy greener and develop a more resilient smart system, as O’Dowd explains: “Our grid needs to be flexible so it can better manage supply and demand as we transition to more renewable energy. By equipping every home with a smart meter, power can be adjusted on a local and national level so the system is more energy efficient.”O’Dowd describes smart meters as “the enabler”, and they will undoubtedly be integral to the transition towards a low-carbon economy. To facilitate innovation, the government has pledged to offer every home and small business in the country a smart meter in the next few years – to date about 15.6m smart meters have been installed nationwide. “Smart meters allow consumers to understand their own energy use, and, with information from the in-home display, customers can start making small, money-saving changes such as switching off appliances which aren’t in use.”The government estimates that £650m of energy gets wasted in the current distribution system, travelling from where it is generated to the point it reaches our homes. Smart meters can help reduce loss in energy by accurately forecasting demand and using more low-cost and renewable energy. “We need to ramp up our wind power and solar generation in order to reach our 2050 target of net-zero, but these renewables don’t have an easy route to market,” says O’Dowd. “We want to push the government to raise its ambition – we know the technology exists and solutions are there but we need government support and its investment in our grid network to help that transition.”Ultimately, a smart energy system will generate, distribute and use energy much more efficiently. At a national network level, a more flexible infrastructure will use energy storage, for example via batteries or heating, and will shift demand away from peak periods, because when demand is highest, more of the electricity we consume is generated by polluting coal stations.In conjunction with the University of Oxford, Environmental Defense Fund Europe, and WWF, the National Grid has created a carbon intensity forecast that predicts the generation mix for the next four days in each region of the country. Energy users can enter their postcode and find out when the best time is to access green, clean energy. If your washing machine has a timer, you can set it to run at night, for example, when demand is low and more of the system’s energy is generated by renewables. In homes with solar panels, it might make sense to use electricity at midday if the sun is shining.As the smart energy system becomes more interactive with advanced technology, smart meters will play a part in allowing the shift to more staggered night-time charging for electric car batteries to minimise carbon emissions and keep costs down. In the future, this management could become automatic, with more widespread “time-of-use” tariffs. Local peer-to-peer trading could become more commonplace so consumers could more easily trade the excess energy they generate from solar panels. And perhaps the carbon intensity forecast might one day be reported alongside the weather.The Committee on Climate Change states that to reach our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we must reduce our carbon emissions by 15m tonnes a year, every year, starting now. “We’re in a rapidly changing world in terms of bioersity loss, habitat destruction and climate change, so we’re heading into uncharted territory,” says Wright. “We are clever and technologically savvy, so we may be able to cope with what the world throws at us in the future, but is that a world we want?” he asks, adding that as the climate changes, we’ll need to adapt quickly.For WWF, adopting smart meters is just one of the small changes we can each make, that our power companies do for us, that will help the overall system. It adds that smart meters help us to make changes to our power use – at a national, regional and domestic level – in ways that help cut emissions, which we need to do rapidly and deeply if we are to tackle the climate emergency.Wright says: “To feed the growing population in a world with more extreme weather events, increased flooding and rising sea temperatures, we’ll have to farm crops differently – we might need to start growing novel varieties of crops that are better suited to the environments of the future.” In order to have this capacity to adapt, we need to protect bioersity, on land and in the sea – every species plays a vital role in these ecosystems.“Nature rewards the patient – every species has a story to tell, even little beetles and velvet worms. If you allow nature to tell you its stories, you’ll unravel a real tapestry of life. We will be poorer if we continue to unpick that.”Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb048bba3607e286efdc52107924de3f3643b73c/0_365_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f7d97a4030b6d96f509620339f2c38","title":"chameleon cushions and hydroponic gardens welcome to the smart home of the future","story":"In little more than a decade our homes could look very different. Daniel Robson explores how the future is closer than we think The concept reads like the set-design notes for a Star Trek movie: home furnishings that change colour and shape according to your mood, modular rooms that can be added to your home, and bathrooms that can track your health statistics. But the era of the smart eco-home may actually be closer than you think.Futurologists and energy experts say that by 2030, we could be able to use existing reconfigurable materials and augmented reality to change the shape of our furniture, for example changing a brown leather sofa into a plush red velvet one, simply by commanding our in-home AI system. Smart cushions will change colour like chameleons to suit your mood. Bed covers will adapt to your body temperature for maximum snuggling.Innovations are afoot in the kitchen, too. Hydroponic gardens are already a reality, used in a growing number of restaurants around the world and even in branches of Veggie Pret – but by 2030 we may have these at home. Hydroponics uses LED lights to grow vegetables without soil in a compact space, and to keep them fresh for longer. And smart appliances such as kettles and toasters will store energy during off-peak times, so that they are cheaper to use when you actually need them. For now, though, we have smart meters and not only are they making us more energy efficient, they are going to be a main player in reaching the UK’s 2050 emissions target.Meanwhile, smart bathrooms may help to improve efficiency by generating power from toilet and shower wastewater, or even filtering it to make the home water self-sufficient.Buildings will be made from recycled materials, with improved insulation and solar panels on the rooftops and even in the windows. Modular rooms can be added as your family grows and then removed again when the kids leave home, allowing a more controlled usage of the energy supply. Sensors could track residents around the house, adjusting the temperature and lighting in each room accordingly.At the heart of this system are smart meters. Already available at no additional cost across Britain from your energy supplier, these gadgets monitor household energy use throughout the day and report data back to network operators, which helps to predict demand and generate the supply accordingly. They also tell users when electricity rates are cheapest, for more cost-efficient use.“A smart energy system makes it easier for us to draw on and store electricity when it’s less in demand, and then use it again when scarce or more expensive later in the day,” says Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs, Smart Energy GB. “Together, smart meters and a smart energy system help to create a cleaner, greener Britain.”There are already 15.6m smart meters installed in homes and businesses across Britain, and these devices not only make efficient energy use easy through visibility of consumption, they also display your near-real time costs in pounds and pence so that you can keep in better control of your spending.Stepping further into sci-fi utopia, smart meters can help to unlock the possibility of a shared electricity system for each local community, taking advantage of shared renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms, and powering things like a communal electric car pool as a convenient yet eco-friendly alternative to public transport.Electric car ownership is likely to rise anyway, as new government legislation will soon make it compulsory for all new-build homes with a dedicated parking space to include a charging point. With the help of a smart meter and a smart charger, cars will charge during off-peak hours, reducing the cost of fuel to as little as 3p per mile – compared with 11p for petrol and diesel cars.“There might even be instances where you could get paid to charge your car when the power system needs us to use more power,” said futurologist Dr Ian Pearson, during a panel discussion hosted by Smart Energy GB.With fossil fuels, it is easy for the energy companies to control the supply – when more power is needed, they just burn more coal. But renewable energy does not work this way: sun and wind power dictate their own routines.The best part is, you won’t even have to think about it. Once the system is set up, the smart meter, alongside your smart appliances, chargers and services will do all the work, managing your supply automatically according to your preferences. And the addition of batteries will make it possible to store power in the home.Saving energy, saving money, saving the environment. Smart eco-homes (and the smart meters that enable them) will become an integral part of a greener Britain – and the future could be with us in less than a decade.Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed.

I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds.

We have also taken robust action against operators who fail to protect consumers and we will be even tougher if behaviour does not change.”The report does not say how many of those gamblers fall under the at risk category, one level below the generally accepted problem gambling classification, but it is likely to be a much larger percentage based on previous data.One section of the report highlights a concern that algorithms used by gambling companies to track betting patterns are far better at identifying people who might be worth granting VIP status to than they are at spotting problem gamblers.In a section considering how to react to the information about VIPs, the regulator suggests several options. They include investigating how VIP staff at gambling companies are incentivised putting pressure on operators to draw up an industry-wide VIP code of conduct and limiting incentives on offer to scheme members. The document also lays out the option to ban VIP status.The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party parliamentary group on gambling, said: “This report shows how completely reliant the industry is on people with gambling problems and that they are profiteering from them.“As the Gambling Commission has itself suggested these practices should be banned to protect problem gamblers and stop the transfer of money from vulnerable addicted gamblers directly into the pockets of the online gambling industry.”Gamblers are typically offered VIP status after losing large amounts of money with one company, which has an interest in retaining them as a customer rather than see them bet with a rival instead.VIPs are often assigned a specialist account manager, who has authorisation to offer perks such as free bets and cashback on losing wagers. In some cases, free gifts including tickets to sports events and even flights are offered.Last year, the  revealed Ladbrokes had agreed to pay £1m to the victims of a VIP problem gambler who had stolen the money he was using to bet, in return for a pledge not to inform the industry regulator.The bookmaker showered the gambling addict with thousands of pounds worth of gifts over two years, including free tickets to football matches and business class flights. VIP schemes have also been mentioned in a succession of regulatory punishments handed down by the Gambling Commission. Last year, Betfair was criticised for helping a VIP hide his gambling from his wife.Brigid Simmonds, chair of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) trade body, said: “Our industry recognises the need to change practices in this area and we will soon publish the terms of a review for a new industry code of conduct. We intend to consult widely on the shape of this new code, to ensure we are always putting the welfare of our customers first.”The BGC launched last year as the industry faced the threat of further regulation after the crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).The stock market value of UK gambling companies plunged by more than £1bn earlier this year after a report by MPs recommended much tighter controls on online gambling, including restrictions on VIP schemes.The report also called for a £2 stake limit on casino-style slots games, matching the restrictions imposed on FOBTs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fc36629441cbdb6b1cef38780b7bb323b6183bd/0_160_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4096d0f457593799ae7989c6cc86fcc","title":"labour criticises 4m fund tackle rogue landlords uk","story":"Council leaders welcome extra cash but both party and private landlords say it is insufficientA £4m fund announced by ministers to pursue rogue landlords has been welcomed by councils but described as “puny” by Labour.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the funding would be used by local authorities to drive out exploitative landlords and enable good landlords to thrive. Councils in Yorkshire and the Humber are planning to train 100 enforcement officers to vet standards in private lettings, while officials in Northampton are setting up a special unit to take action against the worst landlords.About 1.2m privately rented homes are considered non-decent, more than double the proportion of council and housing association homes, according to the English Housing Survey.The number of households in the private rented sector in the UK increased from 2.8 million in 2007 to 4.5 million in 2017.Jenrick said: “It’s completely unacceptable that a minority of unscrupulous landlords continue to break the law and provide homes which fall short of the standards we rightly expect, making lives difficult for hard-working tenants who just want to get on with their lives.“The funding announced today will strengthen councils’ powers to crack down on poor landlords and drive up standards in the private rented sector for renters across the country.”But Labour said the fund was “a drop in the ocean compared with the cuts that councils have faced since 2010”, which had “gifted rogue landlords the freedom to flourish, by cutting council budgets, weakening their powers and refusing to legislate to drive up standards”.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said: “Renters need a new legal charter of rights, with longer tenancies, new minimum standards and rent controls to make renting more affordable.”Private landlords also said the budget was too small and “nowhere near enough to tackle the crooks”.David Smith, the policy director at the Residential Landlords Association, said: “Instead of offering inadequate and sporadic pots of money, it is critical that the government provides proper, multi-year funding to enable councils to plan and prepare workable strategies to find the criminal landlords.“This should be supported by councils having the political will to prioritise enforcement against the crooks, rather than tying good landlords up in licensing schemes which do nothing to protect tenants.”Darren Rodwell, the Local Government Association’s housing spokesman, said: “Councils are doing what they can to raise standards in the private rented sector and are taking action where required, and it is important to note that most landlords are responsible and provide decent housing for their tenants.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f2b3700850e00f046f0ba8fdd85966e9f983386/0_327_4946_2969/master/4946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=debddfbe04ab6daf27253fe3c3b2ab5d","title":"nfl wild card predictions patriots saints eagles seahawks","story":"The playoffs kick off as the field of 12 is narrowed to eight – with none of the four matchups looking overly easy to pickWhat the Bills need to do to win: Whether you prefer detailed analytics or more simple stats, the Bills had one of the league’s best defenses this year. Buffalo finished the regular season ranked in the top-10 in total defense (third according to NFL, sixth according to Football Outsiders), rushing defense and passing defense. If they want to advance to the isional round, they’ll need to limit Texans QB Deshaun Watson from completing any long-yardage “chunk” plays early in the game. If Buffalo enter halftime leading or trailing by fewer than 10 points, it will have a good chance to win the game.What the Texans need to do to win: Watson is one of the best big-play quarterbacks in the NFL and he has multiple explosive receivers (DeAndre Hopkins, Will Fuller, Kenny Stills) to score even if the offense isn’t in rhythm. When facing Buffalo, scoring on chunk plays is a strong way to place pressure on the Bills’ methodical offense. The Bills specialize in slow-paced, physical games, so Houston would do well to try and take a big early lead and force Buffalo into an uncomfortable pace.Key Player: Carlos Hyde, Texans. There will be plenty of focus on the Texans’ high-flying offense, but Buffalo’s stingy pass defense is equipped to limit Watson and his star receivers. If Hyde, who quietly rushed for over 1,000 yards this season, can exploit Buffalo’s front seven, then Houston will be in better position to execute the kinds of big plays it takes to beat the Bills.What the Titans need to do to win: Rushing champion Derrick Henry rushed for over 100 yards in five of his last six games (896 total yards, 6.45 yards per carry) to help propel the Titans to the playoffs for the second time in the last three seasons. As the season grows longer, Henry seems to get stronger: he clinched the 2019 rushing title with his splendid final third of the season after logging 585 of 1,059 yards in his final four games in 2018. Even with the Patriots’ stout front seven and revered run defense, Henry is one of the toughest running backs in the league to stop because of his size and pure strength. If Henry succeeds early, that should allow quarterback Ryan Tannehill more time to try and exploit the fierce New England defense.What the Patriots need to do to win: Get their offense in sync. Tom Brady and the New England attack still managed 12 wins in 2019, but their Week 17 loss to Miami was a rocky, mistake-filled performance on offense that plunged them into the No 3 seed. If Brady can establish a better rhythm with rookie wide receiver N’Keal Harry and rely a bit less on Julian Edelman, the Patriots offense can better support a defense that helped pace the 12-win season.Key player: Titans WR AJ Brown. New England have one of the league’s best secondary anchored by star cornerback Stephon Gilmore, but Brown has logged over 100 yards receiving in four of his last six games and scored five touchdowns in that timeframe. If he or Henry breaks a big play early, the Titans may be able to control tempo against New England’s struggling offense.What the Saints need to do to win: Quarterback Drew Brees returned from a thumb injury in Week 8 to throw for 25 touchdowns and just two interceptions over nine games. With weapons like wide receiver Michael Thomas (who led the league with 1,725 receiving yards) and a two-back combination of Alvin Kamara and Latavius Murray (12 touchdowns between the two of them), Brees leads one of the most fluid offenses in the league. If the game becomes a shootout, New Orleans is better equipped to win.What the Vikings need to do to win: Minnesota have one of the best pass rushing units and linebacking corps in the league. If they can pressure Brees, they can keep the game close. Defensive end Danielle Hunter is a nightmare matchup for the Saints offensive line and linebackers Eric Kendricks and Anthony Barr are excellent both in run defense and pass coverage. If the Vikings can force multiple negative plays and win the turnover battle, this game will be close. Quarterback Kirk Cousins is pilloried too much for his poor primetime performances and can lean on electric options like Dalvin Cook, Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen to keep pace with New Orleans’s powerhouse offense.Key player: Cousins. The biggest knock on him is that he plays poorly in big games. This is his opportunity to pull the biggest upset of his career if he keeps the offense properly paced.What the Seahawks need to do to win: The Seahawks endured an excruciating home loss to the 49ers last week and were rewarded with a trip to Philadelphia instead of hosting a playoff game. Quarterback Russell Wilson has been fabulous all season, but he’ll need standout performances from unheralded running back Travis Homer and wide receiver DK Metcalf to help stretch out a hobbled Philadelphia defense. Seattle do not look like an 11-win team on paper, but Wilson’s brilliance keeps them in every game.What the Eagles need to do to win: Running back Boston Scott scored three touchdowns in Philadelphia’s ision-clinching win over the Giants in Week 17, and he’ll need to maintain his outstanding play to keep the Eagles going. Philadelphia are excellent when playing to keep their season alive, and Scott is this year’s complement to QB Carson Wentz. With so many injuries to the receiving corps (Wentz finished the season with over 4,000 yards passing but no wide receiver logged over 500 yards), Scott and tight ends Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert will need to play big to knock off Seattle.Key player: It’s Wilson. As impressive as his numbers are (4,110 passing yards, 31 TDs, five interceptions), it’s his ability to extend plays and mitigate aggressive defenses that makes him so special. If Philadelphia can somehow contain him, the Eagles will return to the isional round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba673d20c89dbe7e9c77244880b02879166197c/0_91_5380_3228/master/5380.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9b27d9167b879e769b5c9bd010d4cce3","title":"south africa v england second test day one live","story":"14th over: England 40-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 12) du Plessis turns to spin, in the shape of Keshav Maharaj, probably because Sibley gave him that return catch in the first Test. Denly strokes a single past the bowler and Sibley gets a gift on his pads, which he duly flicks for four. That’s drinks, with honours evenish but England doing not too badly, all things considered.13th over: England 35-1 (Sibley 20, Denly 11) A rest for Philander as Nortje comes on. He is quicker but less threatening, and Sibley picks up two more with a push into the covers. He’s getting a taste for the off side now.12th over: England 33-1 (Sibley 18, Denly 11) A single to Sibley, nudging off his pads.“It occurs to me,” says Sandy Fyfe, “if Philander is an artist, as you suggest in the 7th over, he would be an elegant impressionist whose quality and skills stand the test of time and are obvious for all to see. A Monet perhaps? Or Degas?“Jonny Bairstow on the other hand would be Martin Creed, unashamedly trying to pass off crumpled up pieces of paper as art. A bit like he has tried to pass off his batting technique as Test standard for some time now!” Know what you mean, but Bairstow’s technique was good enough to make him a successful Test player for a few years. Then he started missing straight balls in Tests – while lording it in one-day cricket and the County Championship. You’d think that a good batting coach would be itching to work with him.11th over: England 32-1 (Sibley 17, Denly 11) Denly decides to stand outside his crease to cut down on Philander’s movement away from the bat. Philander tries a bouncer to push him back, but Denly is ready for it and hooks, authoritatively, for four. Good contest.10th over: England 28-1 (Sibley 17, Denly 7) A nudge for a single by Denly off Rabada, and a row of dots for Sibley, who deals easily with a rare bouncer.“Good morning,” says Damian Ainsworth. “Just tuned in, noticed Bairstow’s absence and am left wondering how the ’s OBO warriors will occupy their time without him to discuss (criticise). Root’s captaincy perhaps? Yours, a cussed Yorkshireman.” Ha. So do you believe Root is a good captain?9th over: England 27-1 (Sibley 17, Denly 6) In his first Test innings at Mount Maunganui, Sibley made 22 without troubling the scorers once on the off side. But now he manages to hit a cover drive for four, off Philander of all people. Maybe he’s less limited than he looked in New Zealand. He’s certainly been positive today, making his 17 off only 25 balls.8th over: England 23-1 (Sibley 13, Denly 6) This time Denly’s square drive is a touch later, which takes it away to cover’s left, for four. He gets a couple more in the same direction with more of a prod. After all those solid fifties, today would be a great day to get his first Test hundred.“I’ve just woken up to see the line-up,” says Adma Levine, “and with all these callow batsmen and medium pacers, it feels like I’ve had a bump on the head and come to in some sort of 90s cricketing equivalent of Life on Mars, with Chris Silverwood in the attack rather than the dressing room. I’m half expecting to see Jason Gallian opening and Mark Lathwell and Hugh Morris jog to the crease at some point. Hoping to see Martin McCague come into the attack and also hoping that the ‘new Botham’, Ronnie Irani, lives up to the hype. All soundtracked by Supergrass and the Fugees natch. Have fun OBO’ing this impending train wreck of a Test match.”7th over: England 17-1 (Sibley 13, Denly 0) Philander offers a rare freebie and Sibley helps himself to a clip through square leg to move into double figures. Irritated, Philander beats his outside edge with a lovely leg-cutter, then beats his inside edge with the nip-backer into the pads. The man is an artist.6th over: England 13-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 0) Joe Denly, a spectator so far, faces a full over from Rabada, and it’s a good contest. Rabada is more accurate and Denly, as is his wont at the start of a Test innings, is obdurate. He does produce one elegant square drive, but it goes straight to the man at cover point.5th over: England 13-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 0) Sibley plays out a maiden from Philander, who has picked up precisely where he left off at Centurion. His figures are 3-2-1-1, while Rabada has 2-0-12-0.4th over: England 13-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 0) And now Sibley edges Rabada, through the gap at fourth slip, for four. Hard to see why Faf du Plessis hasn’t gone for a full cordon.3rd over: England 8-1 (Sibley 4, Denly 0) These teams are a funny mixture of old and young, and in that over Philander’s experience easily overpowered Crawley’s youthful promise – helped by a fine ing catch from another senior player, Quinton de Kock. And England’s decision to go with Crawley over Jonny Bairstow has backfired already.Nerveless or not, Crawley’s missed a couple outside off and now he nicks one, coming down with a crooked bat as Philander finds that immaculate outswinger of his. Shame.2nd over: England 8-0 (Crawley 4, Sibley 4) Kagiso Rabada goes very full to Crawley, who leaves one tempting half-volley outside off, then pushes the next into the covers for a comfy three. Dom Sibley gets off the mark as Rabada stays full and strays onto the pads, the one place where you don’t bowl to Sibley. This pair may lack experience, but they don’t seem cowed.Play! It’s going to be Vernon Philander to open the bowling in his farewell series. In the first Test, he was not so much Big Vern as Absolutely Immense Vern.Time for some rampant optimism. “It might be because this is the last weekday of my Christmas holidays,” says Tom van der Gucht, “and I’m on a sugar high after eating a Toblerone for breakfast, but my money is firmly on an England win, for the following reasons.1. South Africa haven’t lost here for ages, except against Australia (according to Simon Wilde on Twitter) and are therefore due a loss.2. England’s bounce-back-ability, they often follow up a shambolic loss with an unlikely win3. South Africa are no longer the underdogs and therefore are likely to choke.4. Nearly all of England’s batsmen are due a big score – hopefully they’ll cash in today with a double ton for one of them.5. England might have a more balanced side if they have a spinner... Er, that’s all I’ve got.”A word from the Cape. “Good morning from a sunny but windy Cape Town Tim,” says Trevor Tutu. “I would be going to the ground, but have given my tickets to my son, as he says he and his mates are going to barrack the Barmy Army.” Good luck with that.The first email of the day comes from John Phaceas, who sees my line about England’s top three and goes one better. “ ‘Sibley, Crawley and Denly, who sound more like a set of adverbs than a source of runs.’ Nice turn of phrase Tim. Though the image that sprang to my mind was of competing Bradford rag-and-bone men.”As expected, it’s Zak Crawley in for the injured Rory Burns, Ollie Pope for Jonny Bairstow, and Dom Bess doing his utmost to stand in for Jofra Archer. The bowling could be all too medium-fast. South Africa, in a much calmer place, make only one change, Pieter Malan for the injured Aiden Markram. They, like England, have three players in the top six with fewer than five Test caps apiece.“We’re going to bat first,” says Joe Root. And that big smile is back on his face.Morning everyone and welcome to England’s first Test of the 2020s. It feels like the last Test of an Ashes winter: half the team injured, replacements flying in, wheels falling off. Two weeks ago it was South Africa who were in disarray. Now they’re one up and feeling quietly pleased with themselves, while disarray, like a Greek god, has changed sides on a whim. England’s luck has gone from bad to curse – first a flu epidemic, then Jofra Archer’s bad elbow, now a football injury taking Rory Burns out of the whole series. If Alastair Cook was due at this game as a commentator, he’d probably find himself playing in it. England’s top three may well be Sibley, Crawley and Denly, who sound more like a set of adverbs than a source of runs. Sibley has played three Tests, Crawley one Sibley has 74 Test runs, which is 73 more than Crawley. Denly, who’s on 651, has at least found a way of making uncharacteristically dour fifties, but England may need a bit more than that here. Newlands, in Cape Town, is made for batting, almost as much as for taking pictures. South Africa are expected to bring in Pieter Malan, their third 30-something debutant of the series, in place of the injured Aiden Markram. England may be wishing they had a Malan too – Dawid Malan averages 35 in Tests away from home, and clearly has the temperament for the top, as well as some local knowledge. The way things are going, he could be on the next plane. Among the bowlers, Dom Bess is the most likely understudy for Archer, which is rather like replacing a sword with a Swiss Army knife. See you for the toss at 10am in Cape Town, 8am GMT."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/447f9031eb482c48a6c60e8f13e941ba3a0d0ea8/0_9_1850_1110/master/1850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c384f3a992f10ed4ac6646c85d6be316","title":"message from the skies shorelines review edinburgh venues","story":"Various venues, EdinburghCharlotte Runcie and Irvine Welsh are among the writers exploring Scotland’s maritime history in these evocative installationsA litany of names is projected on the outside walls of Edinburgh’s City Chambers: “Mariatu, Jalevina, Adama, Tennah, Fatima …” Unlike the names of the white merchants commemorated by the city’s statues and streets, these black ancestors of musician Kayus Bankole have been lost to time. Now, as part of Message from the Skies, five literary installations running until Burns Night, the Young Fathers vocalist is reciting their forgotten names like an incantation. This, at the former Royal Exchange built from the wealth of colonial exploitation two decades before Scotland banned slave ownership.Bankole’s purpose, he says, as his face distorts in the watery visuals of film-maker Rianne White, is not to accuse his fellow citizens of racism or blame them for the sins of their forebears, but to acknowledge the way we are all shaped by the past. “Speaking honestly about our history will give us a better sense of belonging to each other,” he says.At the top of Calton Hill, we find another litany: “Mingulay, Pabbay, Sandray, Vatersay, Eriskay …” These Hebridean island names also have an incantatory quality, this time as poet Robin Robertson evokes the country’s coast. In a piece called Ten Thousand Miles of Edge, his words are accompanied by a whirlpool of images by Susanna Murphy and Cristina Spiteri dramatically washing over the Nelson Monument. It feels like a prayer to an island nation.Taking the lead from Scotland’s Year of Coasts and Waters, all five pieces look outwards to the sea, with its threats, connections and unknowable depths. Where Kathleen Jamie finds unlikely romance in wave-energy convertors, Irvine Welsh attributes his wanderlust to a formative encounter with an old sea dog in Leith.None does it more exquisitely than Charlotte Runcie’s Lightkeepers, projected on to the front of the Northern Lighthouse Board in George Street, its distinctive miniature lighthouse incorporated into Kate Charter’s pulsating animations. Narrated and sung by Karine Polwart, with a suitably gusty soundtrack by Pippa Murphy, it sees those beacons of light in the darkness as a metaphor for hope during the perilous journeys of life. It leaves us with a reassuring midwinter refrain: “And light has a way of returning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe4cf252adf6a9426dab074f4684eca3646d59d/0_11_5456_3273/master/5456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=418ba2bb19a7f068d325e874d17b844d","title":"metoobots scientists develop ai detect harassment","story":"City firms experimenting with tech that flags harassment but critics question effectivenessArtificial intelligence programmers are developing bots that can identify digital bullying and sexual harassment.Known as “#MeTooBots” after the high-profile movement that arose after allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the bots can monitor and flag communications between colleagues and are being introduced by companies around the world.Bot-makers say it is not easy to teach computers what harassment looks like, with its linguistic subtleties and grey lines.Jay Leib, the chief executive of the Chicago-based AI firm NexLP, said: “I wasn’t aware of all the forms of harassment. I thought it was just talking dirty. It comes in so many different ways. It might be 15 messages … it could be racy photos.”Nex’s AI platform is used by more than 50 corporate clients, including law firms in London.The industry is a potentially fertile ground for the bots to examine: a third of female lawyers in Britain report having experienced sexual harassment.The bot uses an algorithm trained to identify potential bullying, including sexual harassment, in company documents, emails and chat. Data is analysed for various indicators that determine how likely it is to be a problem, with anything the AI reads as being potentially problematic then sent to a lawyer or HR manager to investigate.Exactly what indicators are deemed red flags remains a company secret, but Leib said the bot looked for anomalies in the language, frequency or timing of communication patterns across weeks, while constantly learning how to spot harassment.Leib believes other industries could also benefit. “There’s a lot of interest from clients across sectors such as financial services, pharmaceuticals,” he said.Prof Brian Subirana, a lecturer in AI at Harvard and MIT, said the idea of using AI to root out harassment was promising though the bots’ capabilities were limited.The underlying issue is that AI can only reliably conduct basic story analysis, meaning it is taught to look for specific triggers. It cannot go beyond that parameter and cannot pick up on broader cultural or unique interpersonal dynamics. This means the bots risk leaving gaps or proving oversensitive.“We don’t know when AI will break the ‘story understanding’ frontier,” Subirana said.He added that if employees’ correspondence gets flagged, it can create a climate of distrust, and offenders may learn how to trick the software. Alternatively, offenders could resort to other mediums of communication that are not monitored by the bots.A further concern is protecting the confidentiality of the data that is collected. Subirana said if the software made a mistake and the data was leaked, internal communications between employees could be seen by rival companies.“There are still hurdles to jump before AI can do what we think it can,” Subirana said. “I haven’t heard of any HR who has said it is useful for this yet.”He is not the only sceptic. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a women’s rights NGO, pointed out there could be unforeseen consequences from policing staff’s communications.“We would want to look carefully at how the technology is being developed, who is behind it, and whether the approach taken is informed by a workplace culture that is seeking to prevent harassment and promote equality, or whether it is in fact just another way to control their employees,” she said.“It has implications for the privacy of staff and could be abused”, she added. She suggested educating staff about appropriate attitudes and behaviours would be more effective in protecting potential victims.He added that believing communications were being monitored could make people less prone to harass colleagues, in a placebo known as the Hawthorne effect. “There is a preventive element here,” he said.Similar technology is being used to retrospectively scour large volumes of digital communications to fight harassment claims.One law firm using the technology is Morgan Lewis, which specialises in US employee and labour practice. But instead of monitoring employees, the AI is used to analyse clients’ past communications.“We’ve used this in dozens of cases,” said Tess Blair, a partner at the firm. She said the tech usually helped build a case rather than providing the smoking gun.Another AI startup, Spot, has created a chatbot that allows employees to anonymously report sexual harassment allegations. It is trained to give advice and asks sensitive questions to further an investigation into the alleged harassment, which may have played out digitally or physically.

He has been there many times as a regular Joe before he got this commission from Amazon Prime Video, and his love for and fascination with the place shows. At least until he remembers who he is and what his brand requires, and lunges for an effortful joke about an automatic translator gadget. There’s a moment early on in the opening episode, when May has mastered the basics of dogsledding in the beautiful snow of Hokkaido and, after speeding smoothly through the silent majesty, forgets himself enough to make a reference to feeling like Prokofiev. We then labour through a fourth-wall break in which he tells us the crew are worried that line will make him look pompous and intellectual. They chat, wonder if Raymond Briggs or Elsa would work better, until the danger of seeming thoughtful or moved has passed. It must be exhausting.But the travelogue itself is charming. Over three episodes, May moves from Hokkaido to Tokyo, taking in a day with one of the few samurai sword-makers left in the country, an octopus fishing expedition in Sapporo, a cat cafe, a parkful of the revered sakura (cherry blossom trees) in Tokyo and a penis festival in Kawasaki City. This last event is exactly what it sounds like: an honouring of the god of fertility by erecting and carrying around phalluses of various sizes and colours, if not shapes. May asks one of the overseers if there is any sense of embarrassment attached to the day. “Carrying a huge penis is embarrassing but necessary,” he is told unsmilingly. A penis festival is no place for jokes.May assures us this will not be the usual travelogue about Japan. He finds under-publicised aspects of the culture, including the snowball fighting tournaments (yukigassen) and the yatai – food and drink huts which seat a handful of people, like a tiny pub. He keeps the pointing-and-goggling to a minimum (at least in the series’ first and final episodes, which were available for review – he may go nuts for manga boobs and used-knicker vending machines in the rest). But he nevertheless manages to find a deeply eccentric guide who insists on calling him “master” to inspect the bum-warming, jet-washing toilet seats in the local department store and join a group of salarymen doing karaoke after a hard day’s work.I look forward to the day when May can relax and just be his own, non-Clarksonesque, non-Top Gear-affiliated man. When strenuously jocular interactions with the crew can be done away with, when he can refer to Prokofiev and penises without having to resile from either. When he can enjoy himself without having to stay on-brand and can let the jokes fall where they may. He seems to edge a little closer to freedom with every solo venture. Come on, James. You can do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8753b2397482ff48ee1beb34d141c028d7d1bc/190_0_4281_2570/master/4281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bfa9298cef86641ab231cfd2f5fc336","title":"isla de valdecanas locals ecologists clash over future of spanish island resort","story":"Battle rages for 12 years over half-built tourist complex that some say should be returned to nature“Paradise found”, reads a sign at one of Spain’s more exclusive, and unlikely, beach bars. Another touts piña coladas, mojitos and caipirinhas while an adjacent notice reminds guests that shirts must be worn.On a cold, clear December afternoon, however, the artificial beach on the Isla de Valdecañas is deserted, the bar shuttered and the dog days of the year a distant memory.The question for those who work or own property on the island, which sits in a huge reservoir in the south-western Spanish region of Extremadura, is how many more summers the development will see.Twelve years after work began to turn the 130-hectare (321-acre) site into a sprawling residential, tourism and leisure complex, the project is facing demolition.Supporters of the development, who include the regional government and many residents of nearby villages – not to mention the well-heeled madrileños who have bought boltholes in the oasis less than two hours’ drive from the capital – argue that it would be folly to tear down the four-star hotel, sprawling golf course and villas.But ecologists who have been fighting the project through the courts since 2007 say the resort should never have been built on the island, which sits in a special bird protection zone and forms part of an EU-wide conservation area.In a 2011 ruling later upheld by the supreme court, the regional high court ordered the island be returned to its previous state on the basis that its designation as a “project of regional interest” was invalid.In November, the country’s constitutional court headed off another challenge by the Extremaduran regional government and the matter is once again before the regional high court, which will decide how to effect its 2011 ruling.For the time being, however, the island floats in a familiar limbo. A second hotel by the beach remains a half-built jumble of concrete and steel, and the rows of villas are shut up for winter, their drives covered with fallen leaves.Aside from the three men playing golf on the immaculate course and a rabbit that hops across the road with a spectacular lack of urgency, there are few signs of life.The Association for the Defence of Extremadura’s Nature and Resources (Adenex), which brought the legal challenge, says the court’s rulings need to be carried out to respect the law and to restore and protect bioersity.“Spain is still a democratic country and it’s the job of social and ecological movements to be transparent and consistent when it comes to defending the law and the European network of protected spaces,” it argues.The regional government, or junta – which has put the cost of demolishing the development and compensating property owners at €130m (£111m) – says restoring the island to its former state makes little sense. “It was just a space planted with eucalyptus trees with no environmental value worth preserving,” according to a spokeswoman.The junta also points out that Extremadura, one of Spain’s most neglected regions, is facing depopulation and needs to be able to offer jobs such as those provided by the development.“As far as this administration is concerned, creating economic activity and employment to avoid depopulation is in the common interest and is something that is and can be compatible with sustainability.”It hopes an agreement can be reached to preserve the finished areas, knock down the half-built ones and make the project more environmentally sustainable.Some of those who live nearby claim the development’s critics forget that the site used to be a dumping ground littered with cans, glass, plastic and old domestic appliances.“This has been going on for 12 years and people are pretty fed up with the environmental sector,” says Silvia Sarro, the mayor of the nearby village of El Gordo.“People talk about this island like it was a wilderness before but it wasn’t – it was a dump.”Sarro says the development provides service and maintenance jobs for people in El Gordo and elsewhere in the area and should be left as it is.In many parts of Europe, the issue of depopulation of the countryside, regions, or in some cases whole countries, weighs on the minds of politicians and the public, as an era of freedom of movement means more people are able to migrate to find better opportunities.A recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed that in Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and Romania, countries where the population has either declined sharply or is flatlining, more people are worried about emigration than they are about immigration.The problem is felt acutely in central and eastern Europe, where populations have shrunk dramatically in the decades since the fall of communism, due in part to the traumatic effects of the transition, with high mortality rates, low birth rates, and millions of people travelling to western Europe to seek higher salaries, especially in the years after EU accession. In Bulgaria, for example, the population has shrunk from 9 million to 7 million since 1989.“People talk about the ‘empty Spain’ and it’s something we all feel and something we’re living through across the whole region,” she says. “What they’ve done on the island has meant that families have been able to stay in the area. There have even been some new people moving in – because of the complex.”Adenex disagrees, saying it would have been better to spend all the capital invested in the project on a legal and sustainable enterprise to bring in tourists and support the people of El Gordo and the nearby, smaller village of Berrocalejo.Some, however, remain unconvinced by those arguments.Juan Carlos Domínguez, who runs a small gardening business and has worked in the complex for more than a decade, has little nostalgia for the island of 15 years ago.“People used to dump their washing machines there once they’d stopped working,” he says, adding that demolition would ruin him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/451c7b1cc3e35887ef93c1583f05ace9aa491b0f/0_288_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ab7b12003553499963596ec617e088","title":"julian castro drops out 2020 race president","story":"Julián Castro, the former housing secretary under Barack Obama and the only Latino candidate in the 2020 presidential race, has ended his bid for the Democratic nomination after struggling to break out in a crowded and erse field of candidates.Castro, a third-generation Mexican American, cast himself as a progressive champion of the underserved and under-represented, shaped by his humble beginnings in San Antonio, Texas, where he was raised by his activist mother and rose to be mayor. His exit leaves the field, which began as the most erse in modern history, without a Latino voice.“I’ve determined that it simply isn’t our time,” Castro said in video message released by his campaign featuring a montage from his year-long presidential bid that began with a rally in his native San Antonio. “Today it’s with a heavy heart and profound gratitude that I will suspend my campaign for president.”Castro fought for progressive issues and a nuanced approach to issues of race and ersity. He was one of the first candidates to put forward a policing reform proposal and a sweeping plan on immigration. He placed universal pre-kindergarten at the center of his education plan that called for tuition-free higher education and better pay for teachers.He managed to qualify for the first four Democratic debates – and sparked a party-wide debate over immigration when he sparred with the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke on whether to decriminalize border crossings by undocumented migrants, as he proposed – but he did not meet the threshold for the debates that followed. Before the November debate, Castro warned in a fundraising plea that if the campaign was unable to raise more money, he would be forced to end his campaign. The pitch brought in more than $800,000, surpassing the target he set, but he was not able to translate the financial boost into sustained momentum in the polls.In recent weeks, Castro drew attention for his calls to reform the Democratic nominating process, arguing that opening with contests in Iowa and New Hampshire does not reflect the nation’s changing demographics.When the California senator Kamala Harris abruptly ended her campaign bid in early December, Castro seethed that she had been treated “very poorly” and was held to an “unfair standard” by the media.“The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our party’s ersity is our strength.”Castro first rose to prominence with a rousing speech at the 2012 Democratic national convention, after which he was anointed a rising star. But he struggled to raise money and faced stiff competition from a field of Democrats similarly tipped as the next generation of party leaders.In 2016, Castro was seen as a potential vice-presidential pick for Hillary Clinton, and is again considered a possible running mate for the eventual nominee, especially as Democrats seek to galvanize Latino voters and make inroads in Texas.As news of his departure spread, his 2020 rivals began to weigh in, thanking him in particular for the wealth of ideas he brought to the primary contest.In the nearly four-minute video, Castro offered no hint about future plans.“I’m not done fighting,” he said. “I’ll keep working towards a nation where everyone counts.“Ganaremos un día!” he said at the end of the video. “One day we’ll win!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfa3111e29890bf566a39652e4db3885d8bb156/207_181_1793_1076/master/1793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2018cfca3d9743a40f34cfc36fc7404","title":"who is qassem suleimani profile iran","story":"Quds leader was extraordinarily successful in reshaping the region in wake of Iraq war and Syrian revolutionUS drone strikes in Baghdad on Friday morning have killed not just one of the most influential men in Iran but also in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, too.Qassem Suleimani had become well known among Iranians in past years and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Yet the leader of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force was still a relatively obscure figure outside a region that he may have done more than anyone to reshape.“He was more important than the president, spoke to all factions in Iran, had a direct line to the supreme leader and was in charge of Iran’s regional policy,” said Dina Esfandiary, a fellow at the Century Foundation think tank. “It doesn’t get more important and influential than that.”The shadowy Quds force are tasked with spreading Iran’s influence abroad and, in the past two decades, Suleimani, 62, had extraordinary success doing so. In the chaos and death that followed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq and the 2011 Syrian revolution, Suleimani saw opportunity, pouring in men and money to build a crescent of pro-Iran forces stretching across the region from Lebanon in the west to Yemen in the south.The continued rise of Hezbollah, the most powerful armed force in Lebanon Iran’s decisive intervention to prop up Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war the ongoing resistance of Yemen’s Houthi militias to Saudi Arabian-led forces, and the ascendance of Shia militias in Iraq: each of these developments can be traced back in some measure to the short, grey-haired Iranian commander born to a poor farming family in 1957.Suleimani wrote in his autobiography that he was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and was forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father’s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and was appointed the head of a brigade. He was wounded at least once and lost many men, but never his taste for conflict. The war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who (along with their Sunni militant opponents) killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq’s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.A message he passed in 2007 to American commander David Petraeus has become notorious. “General Petraeus,” it read, “you should know that I, Qassem Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, and Afghanistan. The ambassador in Baghdad is a Quds force member. The inidual who’s going to replace him is a Quds force member.” (Petraeus, in a 2008 letter to the then-US defence secretary, described Suleimani as “a truly evil figure”.)A recent leak of diplomatic cables showed the extent of Suleimani’s influence in Iraq: helping lead a battle against Islamic State, coercing a then-transport minister to allow Iranian planes to overfly Iraq with weapons bound for Syria, and spending regular time with government officials.It was his ability to build relationships that made him so effective, said Esfandiary. “He built them with everyone, inside and outside Iran, inside and outside government,” she said.Suleimani had been instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. Outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran in recent months were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence. He was no longer operating in the shadows.Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning that may prove correct, though not in the way he may have intended. “Mr. Trump the gambler, I’m telling you, know that we are close to you in that place you don’t think we are,” he said, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. “You will start the war but we will end it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4129000.1578002277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government backs new 1bn silicon docks campus for trinity college","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTrinity College Dublin is planning a new campus at Grand Canal Quay. Photograph: TCDThe Government has backed plans to part-fund a new €1 billion technology campus for Trinity College Dublin in the so-called Silicon Docks area of Dublin.It will announce on Friday that it is prepared to commit up to €150 million to develop the campus over the next decade as part of a wider plan to create a new innovation district.The 400-year-old university owns a 2.2-hectare (5.5-acre) site adjacent to Grand Canal Quay, a short distance from tech firms such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and AirBnB.The plan involves the construction of a high-rise campus at the site over a 10-year period.The campus will be located in what will be known as the Grand Canal Innovation District, modelled on innovation districts elsewhere such as Toronto, Rotterdam and Paris.The idea is to create an eco-system where start-ups and multinational companies co-exist alongside academic researchers and venture capitalists.While the plan has been spearheaded by Trinity, it will also be home to research faculties from other Irish universities and, potentially, overseas universities. In 2018, the Government established an advisory group, chaired by secretary general of the Department of An Taoiseach Martin Fraser, to develop a blueprint for developing the district. A similar approach was taken in developing the IFSC. Its report, due to be published on Friday, recommends that the State support the project through both policy measures and financial support. The majority of the €1.1 billion cost of the development will be borne by developers, Trinity and philanthropic and corporate grants and donations. The report recommends that the Government invest €150 million in the district over the next decade. These findings were formally endorsed by the Cabinet at a recent meeting.Trinity’s Provost Patrick Prendergast said the pledge of State support is “crucial” to unlocking investment and support from the private sector. “State support, through continued policy development, political goodwill and financial investment is invaluable,” he said.“For international investors, it is a prerequisite that the importance of a project of this nature is demonstrated through Government commitments of this nature.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4129162.1578006755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teacher sharing scheme to tackle shortages has not had any uptake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn initiative to tackle teacher shortages by allowing secondary schools to jointly hire staff in key subjects has not resulted in a single shared teaching post. File photograph: Getty ImagesA Government initiative to tackle teacher shortages by allowing secondary schools to jointly hire staff in key subjects has not resulted in a single shared teaching post. Many schools say they are struggling to recruit qualified teachers in key subjects, including in physics, Irish, maths, European languages and home economics. In response, Minister for Education Joe McHugh earlier last year announced a new scheme to allow post-primary schools to share teachers in “priority” subjects. However, figures supplied to The  show that no teacher has been jointly hired since the scheme was announced. When the scheme was launched, Mr McHugh said he was “confident it will make a difference and help to ease the difficulties that some schools have experienced in sourcing teachers of high-priority subjects”. The idea behind the initiative was to allow two schools to work together to recruit a teacher in a “priority” subject for a job and employ them on more hours than if they were teaching in just one school. No uptake While Mr McHugh encouraged school principals and boards of management to work with neighbouring schools by hiring shared teachers, a spokesman confirmed there has been no uptake from schools in relation to the scheme. “It is extremely disappointing even though the Minister always knew there were big challenges with a sharing scheme, whether it’s travel, timetabling or sourcing teachers to work across two schools,” a spokesman for Mr McHugh said. “The Minister is still keen to see if any schools out there want to work together.” He said planning for the 202021 teacher allocation process for all post-primary schools commences next month and the Department of Education will again engage with stakeholders to encourage schools to participate in the scheme. Education observers say factors likely to be behind the lack of take-up of shared teaching posts include a reluctance to admit schools are reliant on unqualified “out of post” teachers in key roles. There are also challenges in co-ordinating recruitment decisions, as well as unfamiliarity in working with other schools.

No doubt your imagination is filled with a fantasy out of Kevin McCloud\u0027s Grand Designs: all efficient insulation and recycled materials, wooden walls and a green roof.That vision in your mind is the opposite of our house. For one, it is not green but literally yellow: a bizarre choice made by a previous owner whose unusual decisions extend through the rest of the house too, but one fitting for a place that is far from the fresh, clean image that comes with sustainable housing.We hope to repaint the house this year. And we hope to make it a little more green throughout, too: my\u0026nbsppledge for 2020 is to find the ways that our somewhat behind-the-times building can be pulled into the 21st century\u0026nbspand do its bit to avoid any further damage to the environment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMy partner and I lack both the means and the ability to undertake any grand plans like the installation of solar panels on the roof or gutting the walls. Instead, I will be looking for the easy wins that we can do ourselves or with minimal cost and input from the outside.We already try to achieve little gains in this respect – for example, I am a dogmatic avoider of leaving the big light on. But there is undoubtedly\u0026nbspmore we can do, both in terms of the house itself and the way we live in it.I\u0027m looking forward to exploring more environmentally friendly ways of dealing with waste, of considering the appliances in our house and the way we use them, of looking into the energy our house uses and how it can be minimised. I\u0027m hopeful too that we can do that without taking ourselves off the grid or avoiding the 21st century, not least because my job as technology editor means using the latest kit.Hopefully, what we will learn will not only help educate us and you the reader about how we can all make improvements, but also help show companies how they can better enable their customers to do so.There are plenty of people, like me, living in old and often rented accommodation where they have limited scope to make improvements. Those people are of course concerned about living without damaging the Earth, too, and so I hope to find ways we can all make our homes a little more sustainable together.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”.

That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)In a review for The Independent, critic Clarisse Loughrey said Hopkins’ Pope Benedict XVI is “sharp and frosty” on the surface, “but peel back the veneer and there’s a real vulnerability to Benedict, which Hopkins deftly conveys”.\u0026nbsp“Director Fernando Meirelles find his own way to shape the narrative,” she continued. “He cuts through the dreariness of Vatican City bureaucracy by condensing the papal conclave into a zippy, light-hearted montage. We’re guided through the election process by the clicking of ballpoint pens and the flutter of ballot papers being tossed into a pot.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

IHS Markit, which compiled the survey for the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply (CIPS), said UK manufacturing remained too reliant on consumer spending.Its monthly survey of factory managers, the first piece of UK economic news in 2020, showed the index fell to 47.5 in December, the fastest pace of contraction since July 2012. Any number below 50\u0026nbspsignifies contraction and the index has now been below that point for eight months in a row.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The pace of manufacturing’s decline in December will set alarm bells ringing,” said Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS. “Production levels sank at their fastest levels since July 2012 and with no sign of immediate recovery in sight.”The level of new work received declined for the eighth successive month in December as inflows weakened from both domestic and overseas clients.Created with Sketch.

New export business fell for the second month running.The drop in activity has fed through to job numbers as manufacturers cut employment for the ninth month\u0026nbspin a row.Job losses were registered across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors and at companies of all sizes.“This impact trickled down to job creation strategies, as the pace of job losses intensified and companies were reluctant to commit to additional expense,” Mr Brock said.Mr Brock said although the result of the general election would bring some “clarity” to businesses, he warned that manufacturers faced a long road ahead to recover last year\u0027s losses. “In the closing stages of the year, the sector has ended on a dreary note,” he said. “There will still be some obstacles to overcome in 2020.”Manufacturers to end 2019 at ‘standstill’ over Brexit uncertaintyFhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK, the manufacturing and engineering employers’ organisation, said uncertainties over the outcome of Brexit, the outcome of the general election, and global trade tensions had “clearly weighed on” the UK’s manufacturing sector.However, CIPS said business sentiment remained positive in December with more than 43 per cent of companies forecasting output would be higher a year from now, compared to only 10 per cent anticipating a contraction. The optimism was linked to reduced uncertainty, new product launches, increased efficiency and improved client confidence, it said.The downbeat picture was reflected in the eurozone where the equivalent index dropped from 46.9 in November to 46.3 in December, marking an eleventh successive month of contraction. Germany was again the weakest-performing country, while the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in more than six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In 2008, this share was just 38 per cent.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

He’s won two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes for his powerful and varied performances, starring in such films as Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Castaway, Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan. The other... is Tim Allen.”Created with Sketch. Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais. It’s 2016. Jokes at the expense of trans people are so tired. Catch up,” GLAAD tweeted at the time. Gervais has since doubled down on this line of comedy in a Netflix special. In September 2019, he tweeted: “You can joke about whatever the f*** you like. And some people won\u0027t like it and they will tell you they don\u0027t like it. And then it\u0027s up to you whether you give a f*** or not. And so on. It\u0027s a good system.” Hence, the bottom spot in this ranking.Fresh off a particularly biting 2011 hosting set, was Gervais struggling to figure out just the right amount of meanness for the ceremony? The comedian didn’t seem quite like himself that time around. He delivered some good lines, among them: “For any of you who don’t know, the Golden Globes are just like the Oscars, but without all that… esteem” and “The Hollywood Foreign Press have warned me that if I insult any of you, or any of them, or offend any viewers, or cause any controversy whatsoever, they’ll definitely invite me back next year.” Still, this year doesn’t stand out in Gervais’s Golden Globes history.In 2011, Gervais’s jokes were so incisive, so daring and – let’s just say it, mean – that they elicited occasional gasps from the audience. Over the course of the evening, the comedian took aim at the 2010 film The Tourist starring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie (“It seems like everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist,” he quipped), Robert Downey Jr, and the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organises the Golden Globes. Gervais’s set was so controversial that some wondered whether it would prove to be his last – but the comedian has now been invited back three more times.Gervais’s first turn as host was also his best. Almost 10 years ago, the comedian proved to be a delightfully sarcastic emcee, capable of the most ferocious take-downs. His best lines of the night were delivered with fake enthusiasm, such as when Gervais – the creator of the original version of The Office in the UK, tore into the US version starring Steve Carell (“Where does he get his ideas from?” Gervais mused). The 2010 ceremony also included this brilliant bit about writers in Hollywood: “This next category is a bit of a downer, to be honest: it’s for writing. We all know writers get way too much credit in Hollywood, and that’s due to the generosity of actors sometimes mentioning them.” And let’s not forget what is perhaps Gervais’s most celebrated Golden Globes quip, through which he introduced Mel Gibson to the stage: “I like a drink as much as the next man,” Gervais said, glass in hand. “Unless the next man… is Mel Gibson.”After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais.

So I came out and said, ‘Our next two presenters, the first has won five Oscars, combined box office of five billion dollars. And the other, Tim Allen.’ Right? It’s a fine joke. I’m teasing Tim Allen,” the comedian said.“But anyone standing next to Tom Hanks, unless it’s Dustin Hoffman or Robert Redford or Robert De Niro, that could be me. But it happened to be Tim Allen. And I have nothing against Tim Allen. He’s a good actor. He’s probably a nice bloke.”Gervais\u0026nbspinsisted there was “no malice” behind his joke, adding that he didn’t want Allen to feel personally targeted by it.Rather, he said, he made fun of Allen simply because he was “standing next to Tom Hanks” in that instant.The 2020 Golden Globes will take place on 5 January.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”.

He claims he was whistleblowing.But lawyers for the charity say he defied managers’ rules. The league says that in 2015, pension guidelines changed, so it was unable to automatically enrol new staff in an ethical scheme. It rectified this when it was made aware of the rule changes.A spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid if they dismissed staff on the grounds of being vegetarian or vegan they would have few staff left and they were not contesting his claim that veganism should be protected.She referred to a statement from 2018, saying: “The discussion about veganism being a ‘philosophical belief’ is a thought-provoking one which many of our staff will be interested in however, this debate has absolutely no connection with why Mr Casamitjana was sacked.”The statement went on: “Mr Casamitjana was not dismissed because he raised concerns about the pension, either internally or externally, so our view is that there is no substance to his claims that he was ‘whistleblowing’.”\u0026nbspThe charity said the reason for his dismissal was confidential but said it was sad that a former employee, who was passionate about protecting animals, was taking action against one of the UK’s most vegan-friendly employers.\u0026nbspThis week’s hearing, by a panel in Norwich, which will focus on the status of veganism, will be followed by a tribunal in April to judge the dismissal case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB.

He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Stormzy responded by branding Wiley a “pr**k” and claiming that Wiley’s anger was at odds with the direct messages he had sent.\u0026nbsp“OK I actually think you do crack coz you dm’d me yesterday saying ‘bro omg let’s build houses in Ghana for our mums’ and now you’re here moving mad,” Stormzy tweeted.“You are a pr**k coz you dm me all the time like it’s mad love and we’re brothers and then you come on the internet and act weird and the reason that makes you a prick is because you know I won’t ever say anything on the TL because arguing on the net has never been my style,” he added.Wiley then responded: “You ain’t ready for smoke mike your a star go be a star and mind ya own bizness on this 1.”Stormzy lashes out at media for ‘intentionally spinning’ his words Harry Styles chants ‘f*** Boris’ as Stormzy joins him on stageStormzy’s second album heralds a man who knows exactly who he isAfter a continued back-and-forth, Stormzy dismissed Wiley’s suggestion that the pair meet to work out their differences.“Shut up man no one wants to link you you dinosaur lol,” he said.He added: “I love you so much but you are so annoying.”Many fans pointed out Wiley’s hypocrisy for mocking Stormzy’s Sheeran collaboration, given Wiley also teamed up with the singer-songwriter for the track “You”, from Sheeran’s 2011 EP No 5 Collaborations Project.Stormzy is currently on course to score the first number one of the decade with “Own It”, against Lewis Capaldi’s “Before You Go” and Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now”.Heavy is the Head\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Defence chiefs were perplexed.It turned out the interlopers were playing Pokemon Go, the augmented reality mobile game which launched that month and quickly sparked a global phenomenon.More than three years on, newly released documents have revealed how the Canadian military responded to the trespassers entering its compounds in search of digital creatures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMuch of the initial reaction expressed confusion and curiosity, files obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) show.“The game’s premise seems to be going to the ‘PokeStopsGyms’ to collect ‘Pokemons’,” noted David Levenick, a security expert at Borden base of northwest Toronto. “We should almost hire a 12-year-old to help us out with this.”Created with Sketch.Pokemon Centre opens in London Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.At least three officers at different bases were assigned to play the game, which challenges users to find virtual monsters in real-world locations.

They warned a PokeStop at North Bay would cause increase in traffic and “could have a negative impact on 22 Wing’s Mission,” while another at Halifax naval base was deemed to be a “security risk”.But the military correspondence shows the response to the game was not always hostile.After a PokeStop was found at a museum at Garrison Petawawa in Ontario, Major Alicia Saucier wrote: “Maybe some extra people will visit the museum!”Rear Admiral John Newton even\u0026nbsprecommended adding a PokeStop at another location in Halifax because “this addition, with the already existing PokeStops at the museum and the admiral’s residence, would increase the museum’s attendance”.Life and work are best accomplished if there is good fun, health and friendship, he wrote. If Pokemon Go enables these values, while we protect our interests, then we all stand to marvel at this intersection of technology, gaming and health.At the height of its popularity, hundreds of millions of people worldwide were playing Pokemon Go, which rose to the top of app download charts as the craze swept around across the globe. User numbers have since declined, although the game retains a loyal fanbase.The app has been credited with promoting physical activity and helping local businesses by increasing footfall, but it also attracted controversy following a string of accidents involving users distracted by their phones.Players in Bosnia have strayed into minefields in search\u0026nbspof Pokemon, while police in Washington state last year pulled over a driver who was playing the game\u0026nbspon eight devices\u0026nbspsimultaneously.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Insiders have already suggested that Mr Serraj will end up asking for up to 2,000 Turkish soldiers to defend the capital against the forces of renegade officer Khalifa Haftar and his foreign backers.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspcontroversial measure to send troops was passed in Turkey\u0027s parliament on Thursday by 325 to 184 votes, with opposition lawmakers voting against it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTurkey has already reportedly recruited and deployed scores of Syrian fighters to Libya to bolster forces defending the capital, Tripoli. That has elicited protests from Mr Haftar’s backers, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, the latter of which organised an emergency summit of the Arab League this week to discuss Libya.\u0026nbspThe security and maritime pacts between Libya and Turkey have also provoked Greece and Cyprus, which are nervous about Turkish expansion across the Mediterranean. Both have begun conferring with Cairo and lining up with Haftar’s backers, which include France and Russia. Greek foreign minister Nikolaos Dendias travelled to eastern Libya late last month to meet Mr Haftar.Meanwhile Libya’s neighbour Algeria and its former colonial overlord Italy,\u0026nbsploosely backing the government in Tripoli, appear more sanguine about the impending Turkish intervention.Created with Sketch.Libya airstrike: Migrant detention centre hit in airstrike, killing 60 Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Migrants carry the remains of their belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2The point of impact of a bomb that was dropped on a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Blood stains are seen among debris following an airstrike that hit a detention centre  for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2A woman picks up clothes among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants gather outside following an airstrike on the detention centre in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2A man carries his belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants sit together with their remaining belongings in the yard of the detention centre that was hit by an airstrike in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on July 2Migrants carry the remains of their belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2The point of impact of a bomb that was dropped on a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Blood stains are seen among debris following an airstrike that hit a detention centre  for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2A woman picks up clothes among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants gather outside following an airstrike on the detention centre in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2A man carries his belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants sit together with their remaining belongings in the yard of the detention centre that was hit by an airstrike in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on July 2At stake is the future of Libya, now in the grips of a nine-month civil conflict pitting forces loyal to Mr Haftar against the authority in Tripoli, which is called the Government of National Accord.\u0026nbspBut the\u0026nbspentrance of Turkey as a player in Libya, with their maritime and security deals, has accelerated a scramble to exploit potentially hundreds of billions of dollars worth of underwater fossil fuel reserves claimed by the nations of the eastern Mediterranean. Greece and Cyprus worry the deals delineate\u0026nbspmaritime borders that Ankara could cite to explore oil and gas in the area.The deals have “brought about gains of great strategic importance for our country”, Mr Erdogan said in a New Year’s Eve speech. “The projects aimed at entirely excluding Turkey from the Mediterranean have thus been wholly thwarted with our recent steps.”Turkey has already sent military drones and armoured vehicles to its Libyan allies, while the UAE and Egypt continue funneling weapons to Mr Haftar, according to a United Nations report.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTrump will come last in the Mediterranean gas race over LibyaExperts say Turkey has long sought the maritime expansion deal, which gives it the ability to project its power across the sea and puts pressure on Greece to reopen long-dormant talks on control over disputed Aegean Sea islands and waterways.\u0026nbsp“The gas and oil is the bonus,” said Yusuf Erim, an analyst at TRT World, Turkey’s public broadcaster. “Number one is the national security advantages of being able to open up into the eastern Mediterranean.”Authorities in Tripoli initially refused to sign the deal, worried it would alienate potential allies in Europe, but gave in to Ankara’s request in November as Mr Haftar’s forces crept up on the capital.\u0026nbsp“They self-immolated themselves from a diplomatic perspective to save themselves militarily,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a north Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank.The deal gives Turkey a far greater stake in the events unfolding in Libya, which has strong historical ties to Anatolia. Fresh Turkish assistance to Libya could include anti-aircraft weaponry and jamming equipment to stop UAE-supplied combat and surveillance drones.\u0026nbsp“The priority is to help avoid the collapse of the GNA government in Tripoli,” said Mr Harchaoui. “It is about making sure the GNA doesn’t get toppled by Haftar and the UAE.”Open support for the Libyan government would also mark an escalatory challenge to the UAE, Russia and Egypt, which are providing\u0026nbsparms and fighters to Haftar, raising the stakes in any bid to take over western Libya.\u0026nbsp“Erdogan realised the clandestine space was overcrowded,” said Mr Harchaoui. “He thought he would get first-movers advantage by invading the official space.”Mr Erim acknowledged that any dispatch of Turkish troops to north Africa would test the limits of the armed forces.\u0026nbspSome Turkish voices have opposed the deal, which follows foreign military deployments to Syria and Qatar.\u0026nbsp“Turkey will end up facing General Haftar, France and Egypt,” said a commentary in the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper. “Saudi Arabia is also playing a role behind the scenes, and there is no doubt that Russia is there as the biggest power.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employers such as the MoD and the NHS had said they were safe.But it simply wasn’t true . . . and at least  rogue operators were free to roam in a “scammer’s paradise”.To add insult to injury, the victims — some of whom have reported feeling suicidal — are now being fined for unknowingly participating in these schemes, which broke tax laws.And who’s to blame  Tony Blair and his Labour government, who relaxed rules around HMRC enrolment in , allowing dodgy pension schemes to sign up with virtually no checks.This was supposed to bring “security, dignity and comfort in old age”. Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government.

Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting.

That means updating the treason act.”At least  British citizens in total fled to join up with Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.One in five of those were killed on the battlefield or in coalition air strikes, and  have already ed home.It was thought that only around  were still unaccounted for, but the most recent a secret assessment by intelligence agencies has discovered that number has close to doubled to more than  with their wives and offspring counted.Ministers refused to discuss their legal advice.A Home Office spokesman said: “The Government’s priority is the safety and security of the UK and the people who live here.“Those who have fought for or supported Daesh should wherever possible face justice for their crimes in the most appropriate jurisdiction, which will often be in the region where their offences have been committed.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

THE most effective force fighting Daesh , Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al—is extremely dangerous  a foolish escalation.The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.Soleimani, , was commander of the Quds Force, the elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo posted a video he said showed Iraqis dancing in the street thankful that General Soleimani is no more.Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the assassination of Gen Soleimani and said the air strike was an act of aggression that that would lead to war in Iraq, the region and the world.He said the men killed were major symbols in achieving victory against ISIS terrorists.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, long supported by Iran, condemned what it called criminal US aggression.Dalia Dassa Kaye, an Iran expert at Rand Corporation, a US think-tank, tweeted: The notion that President Trump doesnt want war with Iran rings hollowthis was a deliberate attack.Killing this target will likely be viewed as an act of war regardless.Former Middle East minister Alistair Burt said the airstrike could cause a huge potential escalation of the conflict, of which the consequences are unknown.Soleimanis killing follows the New Years Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the US Embassy in Baghdad.The two-day embassy attack, which ended on Wednesday, prompted Mr Trump to order about  US troops deployed to the Middle East.That siege followed US air strikes on the militia in Iraq and Syria.On Thursday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned the US military would pre-emptively strike Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syriathere were signs the paramilitary groups were planning more attacks against American bases and personnel in the region.A senior Iraqi politician and high-level security official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Gen Soleimani, whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria.The American drone strike saw multiple missiles hit two cars carrying Gen Soleimani and several officials with Iranian-backed militias as they were leaving the airport.Qasem Soleimani became head of the Quds Force in , a position in which he kept a low profile for years while he strengthened Irans ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syrias government and Shiite militia groups in Iraq.He was known as The Shadow Commander by his enemies, spending most of his career as a recluse and a spook.The Quds Force, tasked with carrying out operations beyond Irans borders, shored up support for Syrias Assad when he looked close to defeat in the civil war raging since  and also helped defeat ISIS in Iraq.Former CIA officer John Maguire said Soleimani was the single most powerful operative in the Middle East.Soleimani had survived several assassination attempts against him by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies over the past two decades.The Trump administration designed Soleimanis Quds Force as a terror organisation in April last year.He was the second most powerful person in Iran behind the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at the time of his assassination.He was hailed as a national hero by many in Iran and was awarded the Order of Zolfiqar medal, Irans highest military honour, last year.Iraqi state television said that five Iraqis and two guests had been killed. Pictures showed burning debris on an airport road.A senior Iraqi politician told AP that Soleimanis body was identied by the ring he wore.The strike was carried out by the Joint Special Operation Command.The White House said the attack was carried out at the direction of the president.Mr Trump ordered the strike at a time when the US Congress was in recess.Responding to the drone strike, Democrats took aim at Trumps decision.Former Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement: Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, and he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy...much remains unknown, but Iran will surely respond. We could be on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter: Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration conducted the airstrike without consultation of Congress or an authorisation for use of military force against Iran.She said it risked provoking a dangerous escalation in violence.Bernie Sanders pointed to the approximately , American lives that have already been lost in the Middle East.He said in a statement: Trumps dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.Trump promised to end endless wars, but this action puts us on the path to another one.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As almost the first act of the new Tory Government, flexing the muscles of its new -seat majority, protections for child refugees built into the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill were dropped, along with protections for British workers. Since , the rights of child ­refugees to join relatives in another EU country have been protected by a bill that said these rights would continue after Brexit . But four days before Christmas, the Government amended Clause  of the EU Withdrawal Bill. Now ­ministers will just have to give “a statement to Parliament”. Next week, MPs willto vote on the amended bill, which sets out the terms of the transition period as we prepare to leave the EU. When they do, they should listen to the words of Lord Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who came to Britain aged six in , who was among , children saved from the Nazis by the Kindertransport evacuations. “To all those MPs who will vote this week, I want to want to say that Britain has an honourable humanitarian tradition when it comes to child ­refugees,” former MP Lord Dubs, now , says. “It is a shocking, shocking thing to deny them safety. I would urge you to speak out and say as a country, we are better than this.” As millions of us spent New Year’s Day eating Quality Street and watching the Von Trapps escape the Nazis over the Austrian mountains, there will have been children taking that same desperate route through the ­mountains of Europe. “This was a bombshell,” Lord Dubs says. “It wasn’t in the manesto. There is no electoral mandate for it.” In , Lord Dubs’ campaigning led to legislation known as the Dubs Amendment, which hoped to get safe passage for unaccompanied child refugees during the migrant crisis.  “Back then, there were Tory MPs and even some government ministers who would tell me to keep going, but the mood and composition of the Government has changed,” he says. “This tells me we had better be careful about where government goes next.” Alf Dubs was six when the Nazis took over his home city of Prague. “I have bits of memory,” he says. “I remember at school we had to tear out the picture of the Czech President Benes and paste in a picture of Adolf Hitler. There were German soldiers everywhere. “My father was Jewish and so he left first. His cousins decided to stay and in  they were sent to Auschwitz. I remember being at the station in Prague waiting for the Kindertransport, German soldiers everywhere, but I was too young to feel real danger.” The train was one of eight from Prague to London organised by British hero Nicholas Winton, whom the Mirror awarded a Pride of Britain letime achievement award to in . Winton’s trains saved  children from the Nazi death camps.  “It was such a long train journey, two days, and then we reached the Dutch border and the older children cheered because they knew we were safe,” Lord Dubs says. “We went by boat from the Hook of Holland to Harwich and then to Liverpool Street. I was lucky – my father had got to the UK. “My mother was trying to leave but she couldn’t get an exit permit. At Gestapo headquarters, officials threw her down the stairs. She landed in a heap but they threw her passport after her. She was able to escape, and arrived in London the day before Germany invaded Poland.” Soon after, his father died of a heart attack, and his mother was ­scrubbing floors in a Manchester restaurant. Their son was made a Lord in .  After a letime of campaigning for the rights of other refugee children, Lord Dubs recently visited the camps of northern France and the Greek islands. “The conditions are shocking in Greece,” he says. “And it is worse in Calais now than in the time of the Jungle, because the police are taking their tents and sleeping bags. Families are just living under tarpaulins. ­ Children are vulnerable and in danger. “If you take away people’s legal path to safety, they are more likely to look at other dangerous ways of getting across the Channel – whether that’s on the back of a lorry or an unsafe dinghy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings posts bonkers job","story":"NewsDominic Cummings posts bonkers job ad seeking weirdos to work for Boris JohnsonThe Prime Ministers most senior advisor is looking for \"wild cards\" and \"super-talented weirdos\" - one of whom gets the honour of giving up their evenings, weekends and love le to perform \"uninteresting\" tasks as his personal assistant.ShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsWeird  You could be the perfect person to be this mans personal assistant \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

He wrote: By definition I don’t really know what I’m looking for but I want people around No to be on the lookout for such people. We need to figure out how to use such people better without asking them to conform to the horrors of ‘Human Resources’ . He went on: I’ll have to spend time helping you so don’t apply unless you can commit to at least  years. I’ll bin you within weeksyou don’t fit — don’t complain later because I made it clear now. Weaposre not sure how that one will hold up in court.  Mr Cummings, who is paid just shy of £, a year, admitted the fresh push to hire weirdos is down to Number  lacking expertise, and his having to make decisions heaposs in no way qualied to tackle. He said: We want to improve performance and make me much less important — and within a year largely redundant. At the moment I have to make decisions well outside what Charlie Munger calls my ‘circle of competence’ and we do not have the sort of expertise supporting the PM and ministers that is needed.

Layla Moran said it was surprising for her when she started a relationship with Rosy Cobb, her partyaposs former communications chief. She said her sexuality was not about physical attributions of the person you fall in love with, itaposs about the person themselves. She also criticised Parliament as a weird, backwards place for LGBTQ people. Being pansexual dfers from bisexuality, where people are attracted to more than one gender, because pansexuals describe not recognising gender as part of their attraction. In an interview with the PinkNews, the -year-old said she had previously only had relationships with men but about six months ago she started a relationship with a woman she met through work. It was really wonderful on the one hand, but also quite surprising for me in how I had identied before, the Oxford West and Abingdon MP said. It wasnapost really something I had done before or considered before, but sometimes when you meet the right person, it just kind of happens. Weaposre in a really committed, loving, supportive, relationship, and I feel now is the time to talk about it, because as an MP I spend a lot of my time defending our community and talking about our community. I want people to know I am part of our community as well. She said coming out in the context of being an MP had been slightly more dficult than telling her friends and family. When it became more widely known that we were together, I was quite shocked, actually, she said.  There were a few people who said, aposHow serious is this apos, and some people even overtly said, aposDonapost you think it would be better for your careeryou werenapost together apos They definitely would not have said anything like that had she been a man. Parliament is a weird, backwards place. I donapost knowthereaposs any otherwho would identy as pansexual, and not that many who identy as bisexual - there are a few women who are brilliant role models who have come out in their lesbian relationships.

Daniel Patrick,  and his partner Katy, , say the back garden is a no-go area at the property they bought off-plan from Persimmon homes in Redditch, Worcestershire, in August . The couple, who have two children, say they were so excited to get into the house that they didnapost notice any faults at their home at first. However it wasnapost long before their downstairs loo began flooding with raw sewage any time they flushed the toilet downstairs. The couple say the back garden also floods with rain water - and that the builders confessed there was no external drainage system fitted to their home. On top of that, they also claim they later discovered that the drains had been backing up into their washing machine so they had been cleaning the familyaposs clothes in raw sewage water. After three neighbours complained of the same problem, Daniel now says that pipework has been completed - but just causes waste from three other homes to gather in their garden. Daniel, an IT manager, said: Since moving in we have had raw sewage in our property twice. Within a few days of moving in I approached the site staff with my concerns regarding the rear garden, my concerns were ignored and I was told it was due to the drains having to be completed.  The first time was last year Christmas none of our toilets would flush and waste was coming up into the downstairs toilet and into the room itself. The second time, around February, Persimmon acknowledged there was an issue and someone was sent out, both times tools were found in the drains that we left over from the build. The dog walked it through the house and I tried to claim for cleaning and replacing carpets and they said no- in the end we have had to replace all the downstairs with laminate flooring in case it happens again. On top of everything the pair say they were told by plumbers sent by Persimmon that water waste was due to a faulty washing machine- Daniel and Katie quickly replaced it but the problem happened again.  He added: He came and said, it has nothing to do with the drainage and weaposd need a new washing machine- we had to spend £ on a new washing machine and there was still waste coming out. What we also found out was that we had been washing our clothes in excrement- the pipes would back up with the human waste -not only ourselves but the next door neighbours as well - and would go back into the washing machine. Myself, my partner and my two children were walking around in clothes washed in waste water.  We have two young children, we have lived in this house for  months, we have had raw sewage coming from the downstairs bathroom-our children came home from school finding excrement all over our house. When we noty them we were told itaposs not an emergency. During an inspection for the drainage system, carried out by M.V Kelly, the grounds contractor of Persimmon, on May , that Daniel and Katy requested it discovered there was no pipes in any garden on the site at all.  Daniel said: Our neighbour has had four gangs of workers in two weeks due to them walking of site due to the apospoor conditionsapos -it appears what has made ours especially bad is the fact that were not only at the bottom of the hill, but no initial inspections of the ground were carried out and that only having dug our neighbours garden up have they found a pre-existing land drain coming from the top of the site feeding water into our garden. Now that drain is fed into four drains in our neighbouraposs garden which in turn is fed into our garden, so water is pouring out and just sat in our garden, we simply cannot use the garden.

He said: I have about p in coppers - that is it. I havenapost got a penny and I am on emergency gas and electric. I wonapost last the month at this rate. The Department for Work and Pensionsstates that he received an advanced Universal Credit payment in November and may be eligible for additional supporthe provides information about his rent costs. But Adrian says: I feel lonely here, I donapost know where to turn and Iaposve been with them on the phone and canapost get anywhere at all. Iaposm probably going to lose everything. My -year-old son has even offered to give me, which I have obviously refused, itaposs embarrassing. He was given Christmas money and wanted to give me gas and electricity - I said aposno, you bloody wonapost ladapos. Adrian was expecting £ in his bank account on December , however, when no money transferred in, he started to panic. He says officers at the DWP contacted him two days before Christmas to say that he may not receive any money due to the fact he had already received some pending holiday pay on December , but Adrian protested it wasnapost enough to see him through. However, the DWP say they are still waiting for Adrian to submit more evidence to them regarding his rental costs after paying him an advanced£ payment in November.  He said: I was worried, it was very worrying when it wasnapost there. It was a really scary thought to be honest. I was expecting £ on December , and that would have set me up for now, but it didnapost arrive. It is the first time in my adult le that I had sat at home on New Yearaposs Eve just by myself without even a drink - couldnapost even afford a can of beer. Adrian is in such dire straits after claiming he has fallen foul of a system - which he describes as very wrong and evil. He said: Iaposve got enough in for a week, maybe, just a few tins of beans and bits. Iaposve been on the phone to the council to see what I can do and hopefully help me out. I was sat thinking about it and donapost sit in silence let people know what you are going through. I have a sister who is poorly and I donapost like putting on my family.  He added: Universal credit is crippling people - itaposs a very wrong and evil system. Adrian was let go from his powder coating job just a month before Christmas where he was earning £-a-week, but thought he would get by after signing up for Universal Credit. He thinks the confusion lies with his holiday pay in December - but believed that this wouldnapost affect his benefits. Adrian claims he is next due a payment on January . He said: I was told December , and when the money didnapost arrive and then was told it would be January , I just didnapost know what to think. Iaposve had to turn down my heating and only put it on when my -year-old son comes round. Iaposm not depressed as such, but itaposs not good is it. Iaposm struggling and Iaposm asking for help. That £ I thought I would get would have been great. Iaposve asked my landlord for an extension, but heaposs probably going to kick me out and then Iaposll be homeless. I have no savings - this is all I have - which is practically nothing. After signing up to Universal Credit when he was let go from his job, Adrian spent his severance - and subsequent holiday pay - on presents for his -year-old son. He said: They claim I earned £ in that time and I had a payment from work - but thataposs just my entitled holiday pay and nothing to do with them [DWP]. I spent all that money on my bills, a new phone and the rest on my son for Christmas because he means the world to me.

She was crying and said that mammy was drinking her tea and now she was on the floor and canapost get up. I asked her what she meant and she just kept saying that mammy was on the floor and couldnapost get up. She turned the camera around so I could see her and that was when I could see that Mary was on the floor in the kitchen and she looked very distressed. Damien taught Priya how to use FaceTime on her iPad a few months ago so she could call her cousin, grandparents and his family when ever she wanted to. Once he saw that his fiancé was in distress, he hung up and called Maryaposs sister and parents who live locally. Thankfully Maryaposs sister and her husband were able to get to the house quickly and called an ambulance when they got inside.  Damien said: They tried to get in through the back door but itaposs a new house so they couldnapost get through the double sliding doors and on the inside there is a latch. Her dad was ready to break down the door but then Priya was able to open the latch and let them in. Paramedics rushed -year-old Mary to hospital where doctors said it was the swt actions of Priya that saved her le. Damien said that while thanking his partneraposs surgeon he realised just how vital a role Priya played in getting Mary the urgent help she needed. An ambulance came within about  minutes and Mary was seen to within seconds when she got there and she had a scan and that is when we found out that she had a stroke. A clot had travelled to the left side of her brain and that side had completely shut down.  It happened on the Monday and on the Tuesday I met Maryaposs surgeon when I was on my way up to her and I thanked him for what he had done and he said there is no need to thank me for a job that I do every day, you have a little five year old girl who is the real hero. The surgeon told us that with a stroke time is precious and that without Priya, Mary wouldnapost be here today. She doesnapost even know it yet but she is an absolute hero. Priya wouldnapost have known that Mary was having a stroke, she just knew that her mam was distressed and that she couldnapost get up. Mary knew what Priya was doing but she just couldnapost do anything, she couldnapost get off the ground. She couldnapost physically move. Doctors are unsure as to what caused the stroke and Damien said they donapost knowit is related to the birth of their four-week-old son Noah.

As the Christmas break comes to an end, families willto the regular routine of school runs and nursery drop-offs. And a survey of , mums and dads has revealed almost one thirdend up being late for work at least once a week because they’re getting their little ones ready. The research found it typically takes  minutes to prepare a child for a journey - carrying out tasks such as getting their shoes and coat on. Over the course of a year this amounts to a staggering  HOURS, or four whole days.  More than a quarter of parents admit they bribe their kids to speed the process up, with sweets and the promise of their favourite music being played topping the list of incentives. Toddlers aged between two and three are the worst culprits when it comes to getting into the car quickly and easily, according to SEAT UK, with  per cent agreeing that the ‘terrible twos’ are the most dficult to marshal. The job of getting children out of the house and into the car adds, on average,  minutes to the routine while one in  families reported it takes up to  minutes longer to start their morning journey since having kids. Rob Fryer, head of product at SEAT UK, said: “It won’t be a surprise to parents of young children that getting into the car and setting off on a journey, however long or short, is such a challenge. “Whether it’s last-minute toilet trips or deciding which of their toys they’d like to take in the car with them, children can make the job of leaving the house seem daunting.”  The study found London children are the most likely to make their parents late for work, with  per cent of mums and dads in the capital reporting they are late every day because of the morning routine. As a result, one in four London parents - more than anywhere  in the UK - dread the daily task of bundling their loved ones into the family vehicle. At the other end of the scale, Scottish children appear to be better behaved when it comes to leaving the house, with  per cent of parents north of the border saying their offspring never make them late. Among the most likely things to make leaving the house dficult include the task of getting children strapped into their seats in the car, last-minute toilet trips and struggling with the large amount of child-related paraphernalia which needs to be loaded into the car for each trip.  But the additional time spent is mostly taken up by children taking too long to put shoes and coats on before heading out. SEAT carried out the research to highlight its seven-seat Tarraco SUV, which has been designed with families in mind and has . The Taracco, available with a choice of two petrol and three diesel engines, is a practical family car with up ,-litres of boot space. Rob Fryer added: “At SEAT we’ve included a raft of family-friendly elements to our Tarraco that means that we can make this a little bit easier. “The hands-free boot opening makes access easy, while the seven seats can be configured quickly at the pull of a button. “And with Apple CarPlay also available, it’s easy to keep the tots amused once in the vehicle.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrews pal ghisaine maxwell","story":"NewsPrince Andrews pal Ghislaine Maxwell hiding from the FBI in an Israeli safe houseThe FBI want to investigate the British socialite over her friendship with the late paedophile Jeffery Epstein but the -year-old claimed to be his madam appears to have vanishedShareCommentsByChristopher Bucktin:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsGhislaine Maxwell has been accused of hiding in a safe house \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It is claimed “powerful friends” are protecting the British socialite alleged to have been Jeffery Epstein’s madam. The FBI want to investigate her friendship with the late paedophile but Maxwell, , appears to have vanished. The daughter of shamed pub­­lisher Robert Maxwell holds information on the rich and famous and has long been rumoured to have acted with spy agencies. A source made the “safe house” and “in­­­tel­­­­ligence asset” allegations to the New York Post. They come as Virginia Giuffre, who claims the Duke of York had under-age sex with her, is set toto court. She has vowed to “take down the %” who think they are above the law and make  “a year to be remembered”. Andrew has strenously denied all the claims. Maxwell has been accused in several lawsuits of procuring underage girls for Epstein to traffick among his wealthy and powerful friends. She has also strenously denied any wrongdoing. But since the accusations emerged in  she has become a recluse, shunning the parties she was once a staple of. And, after Epstein’s August jail suicide, sources close to her claim she being protected. The New York Post source said: “She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments.  “They would trade information about the powerful people in his net. She is not in the US, she moves around. She is sometimes in the UK but most often in other countries, such as Israel, where powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.” We previously revealed how Epstein kept meticulous diaries on the power-ful men who enjoyed his hospitality.

The Monarch spends the special day in Sandringham each year as part of her Christmas break, remaining at the Norfolk estate until the beginning of February. She puts out an open invitation to all members of the Royal Family to join her for the celebrations, and it’s often those who weren’t able to be there for Christmas Day who take up the offer. This year we know that the Cambridges are skipping the party as they are reportedly celebrating with Kate’s family, and Meghan and Harry are in Canada with their son Archie. However it’s likely that Prince Philip will be at her side having been released from hospital, where he was being treated for a “pre-existing condition” a few days before Christmas. Previous reports suggest that members of the family don’t go to bed until the Queen does, which means she basically gets to decide when the festivities end.  Queen’s former private secretary William Heseltine has previously confirmed this, saying: “Nobody felt it right to go to bed before the Queen did.” On New Year’s Day the Queen goes to church with members of the family. The Queen normally attends church on New Year’s Day before spending the afternoon relaxing, often going horse riding. The Monarch will stay in Sandringham until early February, preferring to mark the anniversary of her father’s death there rather than at Buckingham Palace.

Louise Thorell, , from Ashington, Northumberland, was always self conscious about the scar on her face left behind from when she battled chicken pox, aged five, but thought it was harmless. But in  the scaraposs appearance started to change, and after after having series of infections, she was referred for tests by her doctor, before being rocked by the news she had skin cancer. She is now cancer free after having three surgeries to remove it which have left her with a scar on her face. Louise explained: It felt tougher, waxier than my normal skin. Around that time, I accidentally scratched my scar and after that I had issues. It would heal, a scab would form, it would fall off and an open wound would be there until a new scab would form.  I dealt with it for a few months until I got an infection. My undereye swelled and my wound site got bigger each time it would open and heal again. I got two infections in it and an infection in my nose and above my lip too. After the first infection I noticed it had changed in appearance. It had tiny little blood vessel veins around it. Louise feared the worst after going for test because thereaposs a history of skin cancer in her family. Her grandmother Lillian, who had passed away in  from lung cancer, had suffered with a melanoma on the right side of her face. She said: My Nana had melanoma on the left side of her face, pretty much the same place - mine was on my right side. I googled skin cancers as I had a feeling my scar wound had turned sinister.  I made an appointment with my doctor and was referred very quickly to the melanoma clinic in Cramlington Northumberland, which is run by doctors and nurses from Newcastle RVI hospital. When the results came back, Louise was hit with the devastating news that she had developed Basal Cell Carcinoma , a common type of skin cancer, which can be non fataltreated early. The most common cause of BCC is from overexposure to ultraviolet light, usually found on sunbeds. Louise was stunned by the diagnosis as she claims she had never used sun bedsShe also insists she makes sure she applies sun cream to her pale skin in hot weather .In November , Louise had a procedure which left her with a visible scar on her face that required corrective surgery to improve it.  She said: I had Mohs surgery. I was awake for the surgery, just under local anaesthetic. They take some of the cancer cells away. Then itaposs tested and looked under the microscope to seethere are still cancer cells in a certain section. After the first time they took cells away, I was bandaged up and was told to go for lunch and a drink and come back in two hours to seethey got all the cancer first time. Unfortunately, they hadnapost. I had to go back in theatre and get more taken off. This happened a total of three times. Three times they had to go back on my face and take cells tumour away.. At first I wasnapost expecting the sheer size of my scar to be as big as it is. I did feel awful about how I looked. I tried to joke about it and make fun to lighten my mood. This lasted a few weeks. When I started to see it healing, my goodness, my spirits were lted. I had plastic restorative surgery the same day on my face. Now I am very, very aware of my skin. I religiously apply Biooil twice daily, I put face cream on first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I donapost scrub my face, I take extra care and time on my face now.

The girl, who appears to be around six years old, was found living in a tent used by homeless scavengers, who scour the tip for scraps, in the city of Odessa, Ukraine. Anastasia had been at the tip for about five days when police arrived and handed her over to social workers who ed her to the care home. Police are investigating why the three other homeless people she was sharing a tent with had not reported her to officials. Childrenaposs worker Nata Samokhina, who eventually discovered the girl, said: “It is incredible how many people passed by and did not pay attention to her, none of them called the police.” Ms Samokhina confirmed that the girlaposs father, whose name was not reported, had collected the child from the home in June this year but had decided it was too much work for him, and had abandoned her.  Valentina Kartasheva, from the childrenaposs home, said: “We did not want to give her to him, we had a feeling. But we had to obey the law. Thank God she is alive. She is currently in a state of shock.“ "},{"url":null,"title":"irans qassem soleimani torn shreds","story":"NewsIrans Qassem Soleimani torn to shreds by US missile in airstrike assassinationRevolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani, one of the most powerful men in Iran, was killed in a precision strike on two cars close to Baghdad airportShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video iran-vows-retaliation-after-kills-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news irans-qassem-soleimani-torn-shreds-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNew details have emerged over the killing of Qassem Soleimani close to Baghdad airport in a precision airstrike. The Revolutionary Guard general, one of the most powerful men in Iran, had arrived in Iraq just minutes before his death. Soleimani was in one of two cars carrying both himself and Iraq-based Popular Mobilization Forcesmilitiamen after being picked up from Baghdad International Airport. He is reported to have flown in from Damascus in Syria, which has condemned the killing.Four precision missiles struck the cars carrying Soleimani and his entourage, according to US officials. The cars were struck on an access road near the Baghdad airport. Pictures posted on social media show the burning wreckage of two cars with other Iranian officials and pro-Iran militia members also among those killed. The missiles were fired from a drone, according to anonymous US officials quoted in US media. However Iran claims that American helicopters were involved in the aposassassinationapos. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as thePMF, which were responsible for the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, officials said.  Two officials from the PMF said Soleimaniaposs body was torn to pieces in the attack. Local militia commander Abu Muntathar al-Hussaini told Reuters: Haj Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were riding in one vehicle when it was struck by two successive guided missiles launched from an American helicopter while they were on their way from the arrivals hall on the road that leads out of Baghdad Airport. He said the second vehicle was carrying bodyguards from the PMF and was hit by one rocket.The American criminals had detailed information on the convoyaposs movements,apos he said. A Pentagon spokesman said: General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months - including the attack on December th - culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel.  General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. The assassinations will be seen as a massive blow to Iran, which has been locked in a long conflict with the US that escalated sharply last week with an attack on the US embassy in Iraq by pro-Iranian militiamen.  Analysts have predicted Iran is likely to respond forcefully to the targeting of Soleimani. Hours after news broke of the airstrike the US state department warned all US citizens to leave Iraq immediately. Iran and Saudi Arabia, which both share borders with a destabilised Iraq, have been involved in a aposproxy warapos.  They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. The US has been trying to stymie Iranaposs influence in the Middle East for years and Soleimani has survived several assassination attempts against him by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies over the past two decades. Iranaposs President Hassan Rouhani has labelled the rocket strike a aposcowardly actapos.Rouhani also honored Soleimani’s accomplishments, calling him a hero of Iranian history who defended against terrorism. “I condemn this cruel act but at the same time honor the brilliant service of this brave and enduring hero of Iranaposs history who defended the countryaposs territorial integrity and led the fight against terrorism and extremism in the region.” Soleimani was head of the Revolutionary Guardsapos Quds Force, an elite unit that handles Iranaposs overseas operations - and one deemed to be a foreign terrorist organization by the US.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

She could not enjoy the snow like her wee brother, for she had been in a wheelchair for all her le and the chair would stick in the snow.It was possible to go outside with help, especially when her father was home, butshe tried it herself the front wheels would stick in the snow and ice.It was humiliating so she preferred to stay inside with her books and imagination. But she read by the window, watching her brother and class mates having fun.Then a robin landed on the window sill. It seemed to stare at Marcela. She looked at the wee bird and smiled.ldquoLucky you she said ldquoI wish I had your freedom and that I could fly like you.The little birdrsquos head turned to its side asit was saying something. Then it flew away.Soon after it was December , the day Christmas was celebrated in these parts, and presents were given. There was not a pile expensive gts, but a few simple ones and always one specially unusal present for each child.The family were poor, but anticipation of what the unusual gt would be was always a highlight of Christmas.Pavel opened his first. As he unwrapped it his eyes gleamed with excitement.ldquoYes! he called out, hugging his mother and father. It was a huge bottle of ketchup, the real stuff! That may not sound such a present, but it was not easy to get this kind of ketchup in the village and he had always had to use it sparingly. Now he had this bottle all to himself.Then Marcela open her unusual present. She smiled as she held two unusual looking carved short planks of wood, unsure initially what they were. Then she smiled.ldquoAw perfect, bookends for my shelf.ldquoThere are not bookends, said her father. Marcela looked at them again. ldquoOh, what are they then Her father took them and went to her wheelchair. He connected them to the front wheels of the chair.ldquoThey are wheelchair skis, he said, ldquoI made them. Marcela was overwhelmed.Within ten minutes, Marcela was wrapped up and ready to go out. She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill. With some help from her brother she got to the top of the hill and peered down the slope. Her classmates had gathered round her wonderingshersquod really do it. She edged forward and then reached the point of no . The wheelchair slid down the slope, faster and faster. Marcela raised her hands like wings crying out ldquowheeee look at me.Then the chair slowed as it approached the bottom on the hill and wobbled to and fro. A bank of snow toppled the chair throwing Marcela out and she fell face first into the snow, arms outstretched.Her brother ran to her and helped her back into the chair. Marcelarsquos face was red with the cold and her eyes tearful. They were tears of joy and laughter.ldquoLook, she said pointing to her shape in the snow ldquoIrsquove made a snow angel!All that Christmas day, Marcela played in the snow with her brother and classmates, even making new friends. She became expert at flying down the hill in her chair.That night Pavel tried to take his bottle of ketchup to bed with him. But he was persuaded the fridge would be a better idea.And as Marcela was falling asleep, the little robin reappeared in the moonlight on her window sill. She smiled at the bird.ldquoIt was the best Christmas ever, she said.ldquoI got my freedom and today I learnt to fly."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-resident-starts-christmas-kindness-campaign-help-others","story":"Demi-Lee Taylor, , of Bayswell Road, started a kindness campaign called The Peoplersquos Christmas Miracle, which aims to support families, the elderly and the homeless in East Lothian at Christmas.She asked people to donate clothes, baby items, toys and food to help those in need.The mum-of-two was moved to act in light of her own experiences and from hearing of the problems faced by others.Demi, who is a le coach and an author who writes books for the terminally ill, said: ldquoI have been approached by parents in the school playground who say their children are having to go into school without breakfast some are being bullied because they canrsquot afford to go on school trips.ldquoI hear the elderly limit their food and heating and the homeless are left out in the cold.ldquoI donrsquot believe anyone should suffer, especially at Christmas time.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration.

Edinburghrsquos Hogmanayrsquos city-wide series of site-specic installations combines newly commissioned texts by five writers with new visual projections and sound scores. The event is run in partnership by Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers, Underbelly in association with Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust, with City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh International Book Festival.It follows on from last yearrsquos Love Letters to Europe-themed compendium of works, and opened yesterday to usher in Scotlandrsquos Year of Coasts and Waters under the banner of Shorelines, with work that focuses on Edinburghrsquos maritime history in radically dferent ways.Sugar for Your Tea, takes place at the City Chambers on High Street, and sees its author reflect on the darker side of Scotlandrsquos sea-faring past. Using video and projections, Bankole focuses on the seemingly respectable Scottish merchants and businessmen whose names remain familiar from streets and statues across the country, but who made their fortunes on the back of the slave trade.Filmed by Rianne White, who has previously made videos for Young Fathers, The Proclaimers and Kate Tempest, Sugar for Your Tea also sees Bankole perform his text onscreen through a backdrop of light and water to reflect on his own identity as a Scot, as well as honouring his Nigerian ancestors. With the words themselves projected onto the City Chambers by high-tech projection mapping company, Double Take Projections, Bankole has also provided a new soundscape for the event.ldquoI didnrsquot know about Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, says Bankole. ldquoThings like that are always buried under the crypt, so this piece actually came from being a human making new discoveries. Irsquom not pointing the finger. Irsquom wanting to make people consider how we have appropriate discussions about identity and move forward.As those who have already trawled across the city yesterday will know, as well as Bankolersquos work, the Shorelines edition of Message from the Skies will feature new writing by Kathleen Jamie, Robin Robertson, Charlotte Runcie and Irvine Welsh. These map the city from the Union Canal in Fountainbridge to the Malmaison hotel on the Shore in Leith, taking in the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street and the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill en route.Jamiersquos piece, Seascape with WEC, is a poem that captures her experience of witnessing new wave energy converters being tested on the Orkney islands. Graphic designer and animator Thomas Moulson brings the poem to le using vibrant colours inspired by ideas of symmetry and kinetic energy. These are subsequently animated by Susanna Murphy and Cristina Spiteri, the duo behind Bright Side Studios, who worked on last yearrsquos Message from the Skies alongside composer Pippa Murphy on Kapka Kassabovarsquos love letter to Europe projected onto the National Monument of Scotland on Calton Hill. This time out, Bright Side create a playful reflection of Moulsonrsquos visual interpretation of Jamiersquos words on the water above the Union Canal in Fountainbridge.Bright Side also take part in Ten Thousand Miles of Edge, Robin Robertsonrsquos personal reflection of the signicance of Scotlandrsquos seaside landscape in Scotlandrsquos identity as a seafaring nation, and takes the audience on a vast nationwide journey across the countryrsquos coastal geography. With Robertson narrating, Ten Thousand Miles of Edge is augmented by a new musical score by neo-trad troubadour Alasdair Roberts, who looks to Hebridean psalmody and piobiareachd to create something both sacred and elegiac. This is illuminated by Bright Side to create an immersive fusion of elements beamed onto the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill.As another Message from the Skies veteran, Pippa Murphy, provides a new score to accompany Lightkeepers, Charlotte Runciersquos meditation on lighthouses real and fictional, including those built by pioneering engineer Robert Stevenson, grand-father of fiction author extraordinaire, Robert Louise Stevenson. Utilising the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street as a backdrop, the piece features animations by Kate Charter to shine fresh light on such iconic myth-making structures. There is input here too from singer Karine Polwart, who narrates and sings as part of the piece.Finally, down by The Shore in Leith, local hero Irvine Welsh presents The Sea, which promises a mash-up of Welshrsquos words, film cut-ups by Norman Harman and industrial beats by DJ Steve Mac to illustrate Welshrsquos memoir of the influence of a sailor he met while growing up in Leith. Projections again come care of Double Take Projections, who take over the faccedilade of the Malmaison hotel, formerly the site of a sailorrsquos mission.With a downloadable app developed by Odd Panda Design accompanying the event, Message from the Skies is an immersive experience in every way.ldquoWater is such a rich theme, says Amanda Rogers, producer of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies event, ldquoand each piece sits in its own world, butyou walk to all five pieces, with the sound and visuals you get a full experience. Itrsquos not just words on a wall.Beyond Sugar for Your Tea, Bankole is back in the studio with Massaquoi and Hastings working on new Young Fathers material.ldquoThatrsquos where Irsquom happiest,rsquo says Bankole, ldquocollaborating with my brothers, experimenting.

It feels like my happy place.Message from the Skies runs as part of Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay until January  from pm to pm each night.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour has to learn the language of progressive nationalism if it is to survive","story":"But people rarely vote on their own narrow material interest, rather on what they think is best for the country as a whole. They clearly didnrsquot think Jeremy Corbyn believed in Britain or had the nationrsquos best interests at heart.Now, one of Mr Corbynrsquos disciples, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has recognised this. In her leadership pitch in theshe has called for Labour to adopt ldquoprogressive patriotism to bring the country together. She is suggesting that Labourrsquos electoral problem was not just opposition to Brexit but its ambivalence regarding the nation.Ms Long-Bailey doesnrsquot see why patriotism should be the property of the right. We should celebrate ldquoLancashire mill workers who supported Abraham Lincolnrsquos anti-slavery blockade of cotton from the American South. But even this tentative and politically-correct version of patriotism proved too much for s of Labour purity on Twitter. She was taken to task for spreading ldquoloathsome nonsense...Tory Lite...dog whistle nationalism. ldquoProgressive patriotism is an oxymoron, said one critic, ldquolike humane fascism. For many supporters of Jeremy Corbyn love of country is irremediably toxic.During the long Brexit culture war, this attitude finally alienated Labourrsquos older, socially conservative voters in the Midlands and North of England. The question is whether Labour has the will or the capacity to win them back. It would have to go a lot further than history lessons about anti-slavery.Can you imagine Momentum activists saying how much they love Britain and its history  Can you hear David Lammy say that, actually, Britain is not a racist country  Mr Corbyn saying that the British Empire wasnrsquot all bad Imagine Ms Long-Bailey saying that our armed forces are the best of British. Or that most men are kind and loving fathers and not part of an oppressive patriarchy. Twitter would go into meltdownLabour started talking about controlling immigration.I just canrsquot see Labour becoming patriotic in a way northern English voters would recognise. Stormzy would be furious.would say it had gone populist, fascist, even.But the inconvenient truth is that many voters just seem hard-wired to regard their community and their country with pride. It is a lot to do with accentuating the positive. The relentless miserablism of the Left leaves people with nothing to feel good about. Itrsquos like watching a permanent Ken Loach film.Scottish nationalists used to make the same mistake of revelling in miserablism. They banged on about how Scotland was impoverished and demeaned by England and how theyrsquod stolen our oil. Then in the noughties it discovered positive nationalism and started talking up Scotland as a progressive country that could be a model for the world. Inclusive, democratic, equalitarian.It worked. The SNPrsquos electoral dominance today is directly related to its celebration of Scotland. The  referendum campaign, with its Yestivals and Saltires, was all about feeling good about being Scottish.Could Labour learn from this  Or has Labour sold its soul to a version of liberal identity politics which loathes the very idea of nations  Labour intellectuals like Emily Thornberry laugh at flag-waving English patriots. Labour academics regard Britain as a neocolonial power, with blood on its hands, oppressing people abroad and racist at home.This is why this General Election could be terminal for Labour. Unlike in Scotland, the English Left seems incapable of finding any positive dimension to nationalism. Britishness is seen as inherently right wing and racist ndash even though Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy, abolished the slave trade and led the defeat of fascism.The Tory PM is dismantling the overtly racist, imperial nationalism of Churchill and Thatcher, in favour of the self-mocking, popular nationalism of the  Olympic Opening Ceremony. Danny Boylersquos pageant of English identity was of course authorised by Mr Johnson as London Mayor. It featured NHS nurses, Chartists and icons of popular culture. Thatrsquos the kind of One Nation Conservatism that Boris Johnson is grasping for, and is temperamentally capable of delivering.It is about reflecting the nation in a favourable light, but it is also a way of doing politics. The Prime Minister is successful because he is relentlessly positive. He makes people feel good about themselves. Labourrsquos characterisation of him as a hard-bitten racist demagogue doesnrsquot ring true. Mr Johnson is actually more in the hail-fellow-well-met mould of one Alex Salmond, who made the SNP what it is today.Mr Salmond too was a gted populist leader, a romantic nationalist who loved Scottish history and understood the importance of supporting the Scottish regiments, even the Queen. The media regarded him with suspicion, but many Scottish voters loved him. He wedded nationalism to social democratic themes of inclusion and equality. In his  Hugo Young lecture on progressive nationalism he hailed left-wing policies, like tuition fees, as the ldquosocial wage.Unlike Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon does not like nationalism, and is quite obviously embarrassed by it. Shersquos even said she would like to remove the word ldquonational from the party name. Butshe did she would risk throwing the cultural baby out with the liberal bathwater. The SNP was an early the beneficiary of the wave of populist nationalism that has now swept England.SNP intellectuals loathe the idea that Scottish nationalism might have anything in common with Brexit and English nationalism. But the similarities are too obvious to ignore. They were both populist rebellions against globalisation and neoliberalism by people who love their country and seek sanctuary within it.How these two nationalisms, Scottish and English, learn to coexist ndash or donrsquot ndash will decide the future of the United Kingdom. Labour may have to learn the language of progressive nationalism to have any future at all.Read more: Why Im giving up Twitter in "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10854237.jpg?type=article-full","title":"one-four-atms-now-charge-scots-customers-withdraw-cash","story":"New figures from the UKrsquos largest cash machine network reveal that there are now  pay to use ATMS in Scotland -  more than this time last year.It has led to fresh demands for action to preserve the nationrsquos access to cash, as bank branches vanish.:The free cash machine scandal - how ATM loss is affecting your areaIt comes as thousands of Bank of Scotland, Halax and Lloyds customers were left without access to their accounts yesterday after the grouprsquos online banking websites crashed for several hours.Customers of the Lloyds Group, which has more than  million active online customers, began complaining about being unable to access the banksrsquo websites and smartphone apps from around am on New Yearrsquos Day.In the past four months alone, nearly  free cash machines have been lost to Scotland - at a rate of  a month.On top of that new LINK data shows that the rate of loss of free-to-use cash machines in Scotland has risen to  every week in the past year. Thatrsquos up from one in ten in the year to July.:One in five cash machines in Scotland to charge in a yearThe Herald revealed stark warnings in May from the ATM Industry Association that nearly one in five of Scotlandrsquos free to use cash machines were expected to introduce charges to customers in the following  months.It comes after banks have cut the fees paid to ATM operators when a customer uses a free cashpoint, causing many to switch to paid-for models.The shock figures emerged less than a fortnight after Adrian Roberts, LINKrsquos chief commercial officer told MSPs: ldquoIt is absolutely not acceptable for people to have to pay to access their own cash.The falling number of cashpoints is seen as a concern for elderly or vulnerable bank customers who do not use online banking, and for small businesses who rely on access to cash.Scotland has already seen over  bank branches close since , making it one of the worst affected areas in the UK, and often the cashpoints will also go.

However, the Government will continue to work with the sector to maintain access to vital banking services and ensure that banks support communities across the UK when their local branches close.ldquoThe Government is committed to safeguarding access to cash and proud that Scotland and the rest of the UK has an extensive free-to-use ATM network.\"However, it is important to note that as consumers use digital products more to make and receive payments, the demand for cash and ATMs will continue to fall.

It also found that cash is only used for three in every ten transactions, down from six in ten a decade ago and is forecast a fall to as low as one in ten transactions within the next  years.It concluded that this sht away from cash towards digital payments is placing signicant strain on the UKrsquos cash infrastructure which currently costs around pound billion a year to run.The government says industry statistics state that cash is being used in a decreasing proportion of UK transactions, falling from % of payments in  to % in .Correspondingly, the number of ATM transactions is declining, with volumes expected to be around % lower in  than .A Bank of Scotland spokeswoman said of the latest online issues: \"Were aware that some of our customers are experiencing problems logging on to Online Banking.

But there are bigger questions here, deserving of more attention, both around what sort of member state an independent Scotland might be, and of what the Scottish Government can do now to reinforce European relations despite Brexit.Many in Scotland have looked at the EUrsquos support for Ireland through the tortuous Brexit process and seen a small country with a seat at the table, that has had the strong backing of the other  EU member states, and that played an exemplary diplomatic game throughout. But being a small country in the EU isnrsquot always easy. It takes political nous, strategy, compromise and collaboration. The EUrsquos smaller states adapt to its terrain in dferent ways, with ying political outlooks, and dfering degrees of success.So how does the current world of smaller EU states look as we enter a new decade  The EU is primarily made up of smaller states, a fact that often gets overlooked as the shting political dynamics of the Franco-German couple sit centre stage. And certainly, the larger member states have always had more power. But the EU has always run too on a mixture of one-off and longer term coalitions between dferent countries. Even at the start, in , the smaller threesome of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg cooperated as the Benelux group to hold their own in the face of the larger trio of France, Germany and Italy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"description\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media PsvcXF poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests PsvcXF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": : SNPMP admits chance of Indyref this year is probably lsquonilrsquoToday, one of the newest groupings of smaller states is the so-called new Hanseatic League covering the Netherlands, Ireland and the Nordic and Baltic states. The League was set up in , driven partly by the looming impact of Brexit: to many the UK was an important EU partner who needed replacing with new networks. But the Hanseatic League also aims to oppose Francersquos efforts to loosen orthodox economic and monetary policies around the euro.So while an independent Scotland might indeed be well advised to look first to its geographical neighbours for alliances, a neoliberal Hanseatic grouping would not be the most obvious place to start. But within that group there are countries Scotland could learn from. Ireland has worked hard at putting itself in the core of the EU ndash joining the euro, even while staying out of Schengen to protect the Ireland-UK common travel area. Finland too similarly made sure it is not on the sidelines.But an independent Scotland in the EU is not expected to join the euro in a hurry so it would be less of a core player. And the motley group of eight member states not in the euro including, apart from Denmark and Sweden, six central and eastern European member states, is not strong. The UK, with its euro opt-out, gave a certain clout to this group, disappearing now given Brexit.Perhaps an independent Scotland could be like Sweden ndash putting off indefinitely joining the euro, progressive on human rights, gender, climate change and migration  Or it could look further afield for role models ndash Portugal is currently showing how anti-austerity policies can work, just about, while being within the eurozone.:Sturgeon reassures EU citizens in New Year messageWhatever the strategy and policy stance, being a well-regarded EU member state depends on playing a constructive, cooperative game, with excellent diplomatic and networking skills, building bilateral and multilateral alliances, showing commitment to the EU as a whole not just to onersquos own narrow interests. Certainly, an independent Scotland in the EU ndash and in accession negotiations ndash would have, not least, to show it was not going to be a mini-UK, being one of the awkward squad and demandingmultiple opt-outs.All this is some way off, should Scotland eventually choose independence. But her international and European relationships need more not less work now to limit the damage that Brexit will do.The Scottish Government has already taken ious initiatives in its European work. It has a Nordic-Baltic strategy. And it has established government offices and ldquoinnovation and investment hubsin Brussels, Dublin, London, Paris and Berlin. A new review into strengthening Ireland-Scotland relationships should report this March.:Foreign property investors poised to swoop on ScotlandBut there is much more that could be done. The European Union is at the start of a new five-year term ndash with new Commission and Council presidents and big challenges ahead in a turbulent world. Scotland should have a clear European strategy setting out its interests and goals for the EU, and how it would hope to contribute and participate even from the outside, ranging from the environment and climate change to human rights, education, research, culture, competitiveness and the much-discussed green new deal. Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands ndash even big regions like Baia ndash have clearly set out European strategies.True, foreign policy is not a devolved power but around the world cities, regions and sub-states are increasingly cooperating internationally on many key issues. Yet the Scottish Government seems a little nervous of being seen to have too clear or deliberate a para-diplomacy strategy. Such nerves should be set aside.A Scottish European strategy could be the centre of a wider international strategy and would strengthen Scotlandrsquos bilateral relationships across the EU. That would be helpful to Scotland today and, potentially, to the Scottish Governmentrsquos EU accession aspirations.Paradiplomacy on climate change is one example. There will quite likely be a row in  over the next big climate summit, COP, taking place in Glasgow in the autumn ndash the UK Government will aim to be centre stage and side-line the Scottish Government. But a Scottish Government that is working strategically with other EU member states, showing adept paradiplomacy, in the run up to COP may hold its own perfectly well.Amidst the Brexit furore, Scotland has established a quite distinct, pro-European image across the EU. The challenge now is to build on that to promote Scotlandrsquos wide, dense range of Scottish-EU networks and interests. Andthat is done well, Scotland will already be showing ndash to itself and to the EU ndash the sort of member state an independent Scotland might one day be.Kirsty Hughes is Director of the Scottish

And it was this dedication and reputation that led to me arriving just before  am outside of Braehead to embark on an away day with the Purple Army.The round trip to Belfast would see these fans of the road for around  hours, and I sought to find out what motivates Clan fans to spend hours travelling to watch their side play ice hockey and why such a niche sport has picked up such a loyal fanbase.I arrived for the bus departing Braehead with films downloaded on my phone and comforts that would let me pass the journey sprawled out across the bus, however, I was astounded to find three coaches awaiting over  members of the Clan fanbase who had opted to travel.

Even his pro-Remain stance seems to offend his opponents less than this.The danger now is that this plays into a Stalinist tendency on the Labour left to demonise anyone who isnrsquot deemed working class enough.Itrsquos absurd to campaign for better opportunities for working-class people only to shoot down anyone who makes the best of those opportunities, including public servants. Itrsquos also an odd form of logic to argue that former Labour voters who merrily backed the millionaire journalist Boris Johnson might be put off by the less well-off human rights lawyer Sir Keir Starmer.But there is also huge electoral danger in seeking narrowly to represent one narrowly defined social class, when the importance of class identity has been diminishing.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard is one Corbyn acolyte who likes to throw the ldquoc word about.

Those voters disagreed and the SNP benefited from their disaffection.Britainrsquos class system is sadly alive and kicking, but it is in flux, and not just because the mines are deserted and the factories have fallen silent.

The ABCversus the CDEclassication system is decades old and based on rigid definitions of occupation. It takes little account of the gig economy, in-work poverty and graduate debt, things that unite the interests of iniduals across old traditional class lines.But perhaps, above all, things have changed because there are many other forms of identity that are even more important to people than their class background. Identity is now much more likely to be values-based.National identity matters, but social media has created new groups of like-minded people on everything from climate campaigning to sexual identity which have little to do with their geographical community or social class. Age is now more of a predictor of voting intention than occupation or income so is the yawning liberal conservative ide.Britain is a heinously unequal society and desperately needs a party that represents the interests of the have-nots over the elite, but the answer is not a Corbynite Labour Party that thinks nothing has changed in  years.

It took eight years for the penny to drop that the party must try and appeal to middle-ground votersit was to regain power.There is a clear and present danger of Labour making the same mistake, by tacking left and adopting a new leader in the image of the old one and consigning the party to years in opposition.Sir Keir is not the messiah but characterising him ashe were a virtue-signalling champagne socialist, is a gross injustice.

Enough.Another constant refrain of disagreement has been over what to do about the climate crisis. Cue a hundred op-eds split along two themes ndash the inidual must take action or change is the responsibility of government and big business.Earlier this week I read yet another complaint that corporations are let off the hook every time a cold beverage consumer is chided for using a straw.Surely itrsquos plain thatwe are to counter the death of the planet ndash and on what topic could there be a greater urgency to seek agreement ndash everyone must be involved Governments and corporations should be leading the way, they must in order to make the structural and wide-ranging changes needed to halt the damage being caused to the environment. And at the ground level there must be pressure on these organisations.If therersquos no sense of public willing ndash or even public interest ndash then there is no impetus for policy change from the top down.Itrsquos a good broader lesson ndash cross-society cohesion. Compromise to create a larger good.It will be uncomfortable. Creature comforts and conveniences will have to be sacriced cars, plastics, and on. But the compromise is vital.So too is to try, where possible, to stop looking at issues as binary.A hugely problematic and frustrating element of public discourse that has developed is the habit of seeing people as for us or against us. This is common in the Scottish independence debate ndash you are pro-independence or you hate Scotland.In the trans debate too, you are pro-self ID, the new legislation proposed that will allow trans people to more easily and painlessly gain a Gender Recognition Certicate, or you hate trans people.The notion of existence has become a common theme too. Itrsquos not unusual to see, mid-debate, someone claim that the other party would prefer them not to exist. Itrsquos a symptom of a wider trend towards hyperbole in public debate.Anger and frustration grows and grows without any resolution and the means of expressing this fury become so hyperbolic as to be meaningless.As we tread into  these issues are very much at the fore. We will continue to discuss the reforms to the Gender Recognition Act and the interaction between trans rights and womenrsquos rights. The topic of Scottish independence and the chances of another referendum are vivid.Some will say it is impossible to compromise or empathise when there is so much bile spewed in these discussions. On some issues, compromise will be distasteful, rather than merely inconvenient. To reach out an understanding hand to someone you oppose will be no easy feat.Extreme elements of each side must not be an excuse not to try. There are nonsense fringes on every side. More than nonsense ndash toxic, appalling, even violent. These do not represent the vast majority of decent, engaged people.I think thatrsquos something we forget. The majority of people are decent, even when we disagree with them. It should give pause, to think why someone we otherwise respect would hold views in opposition to our own.A decade has just closed in which there has been a rise in xenophobia, a rise in hatred, a rise in exclusion, whether of vulnerable people, those in poverty, or those born where and living here.A new decade has opened and we have to decide how we are going to push back against these rising ills.In a climate of political cruelty and social deprivation, basic moral goodness becomes a radical act. Understanding becomes a radical act. Compromise becomes a radical act. Volunteering and donating become radical acts.In  Scotland will be in a position of confronting its own mythology.

The Scottish Labour movement should support indyref.However he said the Labour movement should also ldquoconfront the question of what independence actually means in a modern geo-political and economic context.ldquoWhile the question on the ballot paper may remain: lsquoShould Scotland be an independent country rsquo, the real question is what powers, or what elements of Scotlandrsquos sovereignty, are Scottish voters willing to share and with whom ldquoThe Labour movement has nothing to fear and much to gain from constructive engagement on this. It needs a compelling offer on the constitutional question, without which it will struggle to get the public to respond to the many positive policies it advocates and constitutional rather than class politics will continue to dominate.Although Ms Sturgeon has called for Indyref in , there appears little prospect of Boris Johnson giving Holyrood the power for it.The SNP MP Kenny MacAskill this week admitted the chance of Indyref in  was probably ldquonil and that was ldquono bad thing, given the SNP had yet to fix problems in its losing independence prospectus of .Mr Smithrsquos call for the Scottish Labour party and trade unions to back Indyref follows two Labour MSPs, Monica Lennon and Neil Findlay, agreeing with Ms Sturgeon that the Scottish people should decide its timing, not Westminster.Also writing in the new Scottish Left Review, Mr Findlay said: ldquoWe cannot deny the people of Scotland a second referendum where the majority is calling for it. However a clear proposition... is impossible until we know the outcome of Brexit and that will not happen in .He added: ldquoGoing back to the days of rsquoBetter Togetherrsquo will not help us win back those lost voters or win elections again.

The Government would later pay out more than pound, towards Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs.It got worse for Ms Sturgeon when the opposition whipped up a Holyrood committee to examine where it all went wrong, and why she unaccountably kept in touch with him during the probe.The other parties made little secret of their desire to string the process out to the  Holyrood election to keepMs Sturgeon on the back foot.But then Mr Salmond ed to court in very dferent circumstances.On January , he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court and was charged with  offences, including attempted rape and sexual assault. He strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The Holyrood inquiry was put on ice.Also in January, it emerged two patients had died at the pound million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings.The QEUH would stay in the headlines for the rest of the year, a gathering cloud over Scotlandrsquos largest health board and a scandal that still has a long way to run.The annual SNP-Green Budget pact saw Holyrood dip a toe into one of its taboo powers ndash the ability to invent taxes.A tourist tax and a workplace parking tax were the result. The latter saw the other parties, especially the Tories, rev themselves into a frenzy. The din over a pound a week parking bay levy was all out of proportion to its impact.Far more signicant, yet less noisily received, was the failure of SNP ministers to deliver the devolved welfare system they had demanded for years.In February, they admitted they had not fully assumed responsibility until , more than three years late.Critics said it made of mockery of the partyrsquos previous promise to deliver independence in a fleeting  months.In April, Ms Sturgeon lobbed some red meat to SNP members on the eve of the partyrsquos conference by announcing a generic Referendums Bill, the vehicle for a second independence referendumWestminster granted the missing power, and for an Irish-style Citizens Assembly to chew Scotlandrsquos long-term problem.But it wasnrsquot enough to head off the grassroots revolt that would dominate the gathering.As the SNP leadership tried to push the partyrsquos Growth Commission through conference, activists and past and present MPs resisted Andrew Wilsonrsquos hairshirt economic blueprint for independence, with currency the focus.In a rare defeat, Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan to cling on to the pound indefinitely was replaced by the membershiprsquos demand for a new Scottish currency ldquoas soon as practicable after a Yes vote.The Unionist parties hoped it would clamp the wheels of the SNP bandwagon.But, not for the last time in , they were sorely mistaken.In May, the SNP triumphed in the European elections on a strident anti-Brexit .The party improved from two of Scotlandrsquos six MEPs to three, with the LibDems, Tories and Brexit party getting one each. Despite being in its th year of government, the SNP managed to lt its share of the vote by . per cent to .%.Even more stunning was the collapse in Scottish Labourrsquos vote. Doubly handicapped by Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard, the party lost almost two-thirds of its vote and both its MEPs to trail in fth on .%. The result screamed out for an end to Labourrsquos Brexit havering and its weak leadership, but it didnrsquot happen.The only resignation was by Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who had been in charge of the Scottish campaign, who left the partyrsquos front bench and said he wouldnrsquot stand for re-election in , citing ldquoendless internal battles.Ms Sturgeon used the aftermath of the election to announce, on a visit to Dublin, that she wanted to hold Indyref in the second half of .Logistically, the date made no sense. There would not be enough time to translate a Yes vote into independence before the  election came along.But politically, by putting a date out there, the First Minister teed up the fight she knows will fuel the  campaign.The election also led to a change in leadership for the Tories ndash two, in fact.The day after the EU vote, which she had assured the nation would never take place as the UK would be out on March , Theresa May finally croaked her resignation statement in Downing Street.Unable to get Brexit done, her fractious party had done her in instead.Her departure triggered a fateful contest to find a new Tory leader.Boris Johnsonrsquos win was never in doubt.In July, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman cancelled the opening of the new poundm Sick Childrenrsquos Hospital in Edinburgh at five daysrsquo notice after tests found inadequate ventilation systems had been installed. There were now hospital scandals at both ends of the M.In August, politicians seemed to take over the Edinburgh Fringe, with Ms Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and John McDonnell all popping up, the latter to announce Labour would not stand in the way of Indyrefit won power.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who had vowed to resist Indyref, was humiliated, then rapidly toed the shadow chancellorrsquos line.It was a necessary calculation by UK Labour ndash it knew it wouldnrsquot be ing many Scottish MPs and needed SNP votes to govern as a minority ndash but it proved an early gt for PM Johnson.Ms Davidson saved her grand finale for the week the festival left town.Resigning after eight years as the Scottish Toriesrsquo most successful leader, she cited the demands of a young family, but also her ldquoconflict over Brexit.As she had backed three dferent candidates against him to be leader, that was code for Mr Johnson.She used her new-found freedom to become mired in a self-inflicted row over a pound,-a-day job at a London public relations firm, leaving many to wonder how she had acquired her reputation as a ldquodferent kind of Tory in the first place.August also saw Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow go into administration after a long dispute between the yard owners and the state firm behind CalMac over a poundm order for two ferries that doubled in cost and timescale.A childrenrsquos ward at QEUH was closed to new admissions after three young patients contracted infections. The next month, Ms Freeman announced a public inquiry into the extent of building problems at the hospital and Edinburghrsquos Sick Kids.Health was now the running disgrace of the autumn. Although almost all the problems began before her time as Health Secretary, Ms Freeman faced repeated calls to resign.In November, the mother of Milly Main, who died at the Glasgow childrenrsquos hospital in September  aged , said she was % certain contaminated water was to blame.The Crown Office confirmed it was investigating the death of a three-year-old boy from around the same time. Ms Freeman put NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde into ldquospecial measures.A whistleblower revealed the board was warned of infection risks across the QEUH site before it opened in .In November, Mr Salmond appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh, where the full details of the charges against him, now slightly revised, were made public.Speaking outside, he said he would be pleading not guilty to all of them.In December, the Scottish Government faced more bad news on education, as Scotland slipped to its worst ever place in the international rankings for science and maths, though reading improved.In the dying days of the parliamentary year, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay admitted it would cost poundm more to finish the two ferries rusting at the now nationalised Ferguson Marine yard.The Government also announced it was ending the Abellio ScotRail franchise three years early because of concerns over value for money for a service that exasperated passengers.There were more delays to a poundm plan for superfast broadband. NHS waiting times for AE hit record lows. Economic growth was near stagnant.Yet Ms Sturgeon was still able to end the year on a bang thanks to the General Election. She put Indyref centre stage ndash at least at first ndash then switched to ousting Boris Johnson and stopping Brexit.She achieved neither. But the SNP harvested Labour votes and gained  seats plus a th won by an independent who will surelyto the party fold.The Scottish Tories, meanwhile, went backwards after saying the Union was on the ballot paper and urging people to use their vote to reject Indyref.But people saw through the distraction ndash a cross for the Tories meant more Boris and more Brexit, neither of which have endeared themselves to Scotland.That was their immediate concernndash Indyref will be for a later date.The most dramatic event ndash and Pyrrhic victory ndash of election night was the SNP ousting LibDemsrsquo leader Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire. The sight of one Remain party decapitating another must have gladdened Tory hearts no end.As in Mayrsquos European election, Scottish Labourrsquos collapse was profound.The party that won  million votes in the election of  under Gordon Brown and Iain Gray managed just half that under Mr Corbyn and Mr Leonard.Its share of the vote fell in every seat in Scotland, and it ended with .%, compared to .% in England.It is asScottish Labour supporters no longer sustain one party but have become a loose communal resource, an unlocked bank other parties can ransack for votes.Ms Sturgeon quickly used her gains to demand endless referendum powers for Holyrood. Her proposed date of later this year remains an insulting pretence, buta potent rallying cry all the same.With no sign of a turnaround in public services, a good constitutional ding-dong will be vital in keeping her airborne.However Mr Salmondrsquos trial also lies ahead. The fall-out may be what finally brings the First Minister back to earth."},{"url":null,"title":"coco-chanels-highland-love-nest-turned-luxury-hotel","story":"It has finally been sold and is set to be turned into a luxury hotel.The crumbling B-listed Rosehall Estate in Sutherland with a pound. million price tag, has been in need of a buyer since .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Yes, this month marks a quarter of a century since Scotland’s Deep Fried Mars Bar was discovered.“We’ve had people come from all over the world – India, Australia, Bangladesh – and they want to try them,” says Lorenzo Pia, owner of Bene’s, in the Canongate, “They think it is a normal thing to do in Edinburgh.”Bene’s claims to be one of the first chip shops in the Capital to have served up a deep fried Mars Bar, introducing it to its menu some  years ago.It’s a must-visit destination for tourists keen to try one out, coming up top on a Google search with the likes of the Clamshell, further up the road on the High Street, and Cafe Piccante, on Broughton Street.Aberdeenshire rootsBut the origins of the greasy treat can be traced much further north to Stonehaven where the Carron Fish Baris understood to have invented the now famous dish.Alastair Dalton, a journalist with The Scotsman, was working in the area at the time on the Evening Express in Aberdeen when a friend of his phoned with a cracker of a story, telling him he had learned of a local chip shop serving up Mars Bars fried in batter. Who could even imagine such a thing Alastair has regretted not jumping on the story ever since – and explains more– as he handed the tip-off over to a colleague who was in charge of the Stonehaven patch.The paper then ran a short-ish picture story on the new trend which was gripping Stonehaven’s schoolkids .Just days later, the Daily Record picked the story up and went to town on it giving it the full tabloid treatment, and the world learned of The Deep Fried Mars Bar: this unlikely sweet, oily, oddity that then began springing up in chip shops across the country. Years later, it would even get a mention on the Jay Leno Show in the US. Of course, we now know thatthat Alastair Dalton knew about it first.Unlike poor Alastair, that Stonehaven chip shop has dined out on its discovery of the Deep Fried Mars Bar ever since, with a whopping “Birthplace of the World Famous Deep Fried Mars Bar” adorning its frontage.Back in July , this caused a bit of a stir however with Aberdeenshire Council telling the owner it should come down “for the good of the wider community” as part of plans to smarten up the town.We can sell more than  a day in summerNeedless to say, owner Lorraine Watson ignored the requests, telling the BBC the proposed ban was “ridiculous”.“Thousands and thousands of tourists come from all over the world to purchase the deep fried Mars Bar from the birthplace,” she said. “They stand outside under the banner with their Mars Bar, smiling from ear to ear, then go home and let all their friends and family see it.“We have no idea why the council would want this banner taken down, bearing in mind it takes thousands of visitors to the town.”The council eventually gave in and all these years later nobody could dispute the financial benefits of The Carron Fish Barto Stonehaven and wider Aberdeenshire.“It’s a bucket-list item that people feel they need to tick off and we love helping them do that,” Lorraine Watson recently told The Scottish Sun, explaining she had come across an Italian-to-English phrase book advising visitors on how to order a battered Mars Bar in Scotland. “We can sell more than  a day during the summer and most of them are to tourists.“You might get the odd local who buys it because they genuinely like them but for the most part people come from far and wide so they can say they tried it.”So what is the appeal  “Curiosity,” says Selim Sener, manager at Cafe Piccante. “It brings tourists to the country.“We mostly sell them to tourists, often people coming up from England for a weekend. I would say that nine out of ten people who try them like them.”But there will always be the odd person who cannot even bear the idea, never mind the taste. And they would likely be horried too at the many other dessert-type items that have reached Scotland’s chip shop fryers since the battered Mars Bar was born: Cream Eggs at Easter  A deep fried Christmas pudding  Cafe Piccante is home to both.For some it may simply come down to the health though, with the deep fried Mars Bar now a symbol for Scotland’s stereotypical poor diet.Even Mars tried to distance itself from the product back in , writing to the owners of The Carron Fish Bar to spell out that the product was not authorised or endorsed by the company as it did not fit its promotion of healthy living.But hey, le is for living is it not and you only get one shot “The trick is to cook it straight away – don’t freeze it first – and just pop it in hot oil for a few seconds. That is it,” says Lorenzo Pia at Bene’s.“Every so often I have one too – it’s a bit of a guilty pleasure.”Alastair recalls his Deep Fried Mars Bar painMost journalists have a story they wish they had written, and this is mine, made all the more infuriating by its regular reappearance in the media, even a quarter of a century after I passed on the tip-off for a colleague to cover.More fool me to have not realised this culinary innovation would become totemic of the notorious side of Scottish cuisine rather than being a soon-forgotten chip shop quirk.I recall my friend John Lindsay, a University of Edinburgh press officer with an eye for a good story, excitedly phoning me about his flatmate Gillian Munro ing from a weekend in Stonehaven where she had encountered the said battered Mars Bar.I must have been blinded by office protocol at the Evening Express in Aberdeen – or more likely blind to a stonker of a story – in deciding to give it to the newsdesk to be covered by a reporter in the paper’s Stonehaven office, since it was on their part of our patch.Perhaps my editors felt the same, in not even affording the tale a “page lead” , but running it as a shortish side , albeit with a photo.I thought nothing more of it at the time and was oblivious to the Daily Record giving the story far greater prominence the next day – so much so that it is often claimed they broke the story. Even The Lancet medical journal pictured the Record’s coverage in its story nine years later about the Deep Fried Mars Bar taking on legendary status.However, John Lindsay was clearly more bothered than me, prompting him to update a Wikipedia page on the Deep Fried Mars Bar phenomenon to set the record straight, as it were, while also saving my blushes in failing to break the story. The entry stated: “The first recorded mention of the food was in the Aberdeen Evening Express, following a tip-off phone call to their journalist Alastair Dalton that a chip shop in Stonehaven had been deep frying Mars Bars for local children.”It pains me to read the rest of the entry about its subsequent fame – on the Big Breakfast, BBC World Service, Jay Leno on The Tonight Show in the US, and so on. I was also constantly reminded of my misjudgment by a notice in a chip shop window in the Royal Mile every time I passed en route between The Scotsman’s then Edinburgh head office and Waverley Station.And just to rub it in, my we – who I met two years after the story broke – told me she too had been affected by the story. Her boss in London, having heard about the fried Mars Bar, marched her into his officeto demand to know what it was all about.But, no, I’ve never tried one.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"workers armed with light saber lasers to get rid of scottish parliament pigeons","story":"Feathered pests defy attempts to drive them off.Contractors claim they are managing to cut the number of pigeons plaguing the Scottish Parliament by using not only hawks but also hand-held lasers to scare them away.Animal protection groups criticised the use of lasers when they were first tried at the parliament five years ago, claiming they could blind birds.Parliament officials insisted it was a “humane” method to deter the pigeons but would not say why it had been decided to reintroduce the lasers after apparently abandoning their use following the criticisms.Massive pigeon loftThe £ million Holyrood building has been a magnet for pigeons since it opened in  and was branded “a massive pigeon loft” with lots of nooks and crannies for the birds to nest.In monthly updates over the past year, the falconry firm, which visits the parliament up to nine times a month, reported a reduction in the number of pigeons both before and after the birds of prey were flown compared with the previous year.A “pre-falconry” peak of  pigeons was reported in February, which was reduced to eight after the hawks had been flown. But most months the figures were around - before the hawks were flown, dropping to - afterwards.The firm reported: “In addition to the hawks and falcons we have been using hand-held laser lights in the roosting areas to disrupt and dissuade them from viewing the parliament campus as a preferred site.”Gull numbers risingBut there also seemed to be an increase in other birds attracted to the parliament.The contractor’s report for April noted: “There is an increase in gull numbers as we are seeing species such as lesser black back and herring gulls ing to our lands in high numbers preparing for the mating and nesting season. As such the sea birds are actively looking at all suitable nesting areas which the parliament building would prove ideal.”In September, the contractors reported a mixed group of  jackdaws, magpies and crows were “loafing around the site”.And in October, the report said: “We have noted up to four Magpies around the site, two sparrow hawks noted nearby and five mallard ducks using the pond at the entrance. Duck activity being monitored for level of fouling.”Elisa Allen, director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , said lasers had to be used carefully because they could harm and blind birds.She said: “Edinburgh’s pigeons are local residents as much as any human is and they’re entitled not to be treated cruelly, just as human residents are entitled to consideration. They have nowhere  to go, and local authorities owe it to these gentle, intelligent, family-orientated birds to employ civilised, humane management practices when dealing with any perceived nuisance.”Lothian Tory MSPMiles Briggs said: “It is reaching a point when the Parliament will have to eventually accept the pigeons have beaten all the controls measures that have been thrown at them. From netting to rent a hawk to now laser wars!”A parliament spokesman said: “Flying a hawk and using other humane deterrents successfully keeps the pigeon population down to single figures at Holyrood.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"chance of scottish independence referendum in 2020 likely nil says new snp mp","story":"Kenny MacAskill, who served as Justice Secretary in Alex Salmonds cabinet and was just elected as MP for East Lothian, said the success of a drive by Nicola Sturgeon for a second vote on independence in  was \"slim\", while former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars, said Ms Sturgeon was leading independence activists \"up the garden path\".Mr MacAskill, who left the Scottish cabinet when Nicola Sturgeon became First Minister in , also called for a new alliance with the Labour Party to ldquobuild on the anger felt in Scotland towards Boris Johnsonrsquos new Tory government.: No second independence referendum as long as Irsquom PM, Boris Johnson tells ScotlandTodays Herald reported that a piece to be published in the forthcoming Scottish Left Review, sees Mr MacAskill encourage Scottish elected politicians and parties to work together, the goal of which should be \"a united demand for Scottish independence, or at least unity on the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future. ldquoIt can be the basis to show the world that itrsquos not one party, but the people who are demanding it, he writes.However he said the chances ofa second referendum this year were \"slim - indeed, more likely nil.In the same issue, former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars writes: ldquoEveryone with any political nous knows that Nicolarsquos demand for indyref in  is play acting to up the grudge feeling when Johnson says no. ldquoHow the activist gallery to which she is playing donrsquot see they are being led up the garden path beats me.: New Scottish independence referendum wont be any time soon, says Kenny MacAskillHe also accused Ms Sturgeon of undermining her claim to have a mandate for a second vote by muddying her campaign messages in the election, moving away from independence to focus on Brexit. ldquoNicola Sturgeon never went for an unambiguous vote for independence, using the softest language on indyref with a formula that it was right for Scots to make a decision about our future,\" he writes. \"Something dficult for any reasonable person to disagree. ldquoThen, she changed tack, and made the last lap all about stopping Boris and Brexit.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street.

This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"dinner made me see things very differently says hostel resident after church hall hosts festive feast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Naturally, the  guests enjoyed a sumptuous meal - thanks to volunteers from the community who pitched in - yet the real starter for them was the inspiration for a better le in the future. For these lesser-fortunate souls, the only way is up.

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes.

If they don’t want to hear that then so be it.“But there’s plenty of evidence that change is possible in the civil service, it was achieved when I was there, it has been achieved since, but you have to work with the civil service and try to carry them with the process of change,” Lord Kerslake told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.He added: “There’s a balancing act here between getting things done and also making changes to the way the civil service works and that’s something they’re going to have to work through, and I would advise them to work it through in some detail.”"},{"url":null,"title":"prue leith well eat more insects in future","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But there is another kind of paradise. … The warfront was the lost paradise of the human beings, indeed.”A US air strike killed Gen Soleimani, , and others as they travelled from Baghdad’s international airport early on Friday morning.The Pentagon said President Donald Trump ordered the US military to take “decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing” a man once referred to by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “living martyr of the revolution”.Gen Soleimani’s luck ran out after being rumoured dead several times in his le.Those incidents included a  plane crash that killed other military officials in north-western Iran and a  bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of Assad.General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. https:t.co MeDMvMgSp— The White HouseJanuary , More recently, rumours circulated in November  that Gen Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria’s Aleppo.Iranian officials quickly vowed to take revenge amid months of tensions between Iran and the US following Mr Trump pulling out of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.While Gen Soleimani was the Guard’s most prominent general, many others in its ranks have experience in waging the asymmetrical, proxy attacks for which Iran has become known.“Trump through his gamble has dragged the US into the most dangerous situation in the region,” Hessameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on the social media app Telegram.“Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences.”Born on March  , Gen Soleimani was said in his homeland to have grown up near the mountainous and historic Iranian town of Rabor, famous for its forests, its apricot, walnut and peach harvests and its brave soldiers.The US State Department has said he was born in the Iranian religious capital of Qom.Little is known about his childhood, though Iranian accounts suggest Gen Soleimani’s father was a peasant who received a piece of land under the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, but later became encumbered by debts.By the time he was , Gen Soleimani began working in construction, later as an employee of the Kerman Water Organisation.Iran’s  Islamic Revolution swept the shah from power and Gen Soleimani joined the Revolutionary Guard in its wake.He deployed to Iran’s north west with forces that put down Kurdish unrest following the revolution.Soon after, Iraq invaded Iran and began the two countries’ long, bloody eight-year war.The fighting killed more than one million people and saw Iran send waves of lightly armed troops into minefields and the fire of Iraqi forces, including teenage soldiers.Gen Soleimani’s unit and others came under attack by Iraqi chemical weapons as well.Amid the carnage, Gen Soleimani became known for his opposition to “meaningless deaths” on the battlefield, while still weeping at times with fervour when exhorting his men into combat, embracing each inidually.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A burning vehicle at Baghdad International Airport following an air strike After the Iraq-Iran war, Gen Soleimani largely disappeared from public view for several years, something analysts attribute to his wartime disagreements with Hashemi Rafsanjani, who would serve as Iran’s president from  to .But after Mr Rafsanjani, Gen Soleimani became head of the Quds Force.He also grew so close to Ayatollah Khamenei that the Supreme Leader officiated the wedding of the general’s daughter.As chief of the Quds – or Jerusalem – Force, Gen Soleimani oversaw the Guard’s foreign operations and would soon come to the attention of Americans following the  invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.In secret US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, US officials openly discussed Iraqi efforts to reach out to Gen Soleimani to stop rocket attacks on the highly secured Green Zone in Baghdad in .Another cable in  outlines then-Iraqi president Jalal Talabani offering a US official a message from Gen Soleimani acknowledging having “hundreds” of agents in the country, while pledging “I swear on the grave ofKhomeini I haven’t authorised a bullet against the US.”US officials at the time dismissed Gen Soleimani’s claim as they saw Iran as both an arsonist and a fireman in Iraq, controlling some Shiite militias while simultaneously stirring dissent and launching attacks.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Gen Qassem Soleimani US forces would blame the Quds Force for an attack in Karbala that killed five American troops, as well as for training and supplying the bomb makers whose improvised explosive devices made IED a dreaded acronym among soldiers.In a  speech, US General David Petraeus recounted a message from Gen Soleimani he said explained the scope of Iranian’s powers.“He said, ‘Gen Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassem Soleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan’,” Gen Petraeus said.The US and the United Nations put Gen Soleimani on sanctions lists in , though his travels continued.In , US officials also named him as a defendant in an outlandish Quds Force plot to allegedly hire a purported Mexican drug cartel assassin to kill a Saudi diplomat.But his greatest notoriety would arise from the Syrian civil war and the rapid expansion of so-called Islamic State .Iran, a major backer of Assad, sent Gen Soleimani into Syria several times to lead attacks against IS and others opposing Assad’s rule.While a US-led coalition focused on air strikes, several ground victories for Iraqi forces came with photographs emerging of Gen Soleimani leading, never wearing a flak jacket.“Soleimani has taught us that death is the beginning of le, not the end of le,” one Iraqi militia commander said."},{"url":null,"title":"505704","story":"‘A real

The place was absolutely destroyed. There was just stuff everywhere and flood damage as the sinks had been blocked up and the taps left running.“The gas was also turned on and we are very lucky the whole place didn’t blow up. Those who did weren’t content with just stealing, they tried to cause as much damage as possible.“We are absolutely devastated. We can’t understand why someone would want to do this.“ They even emptied a  litre can of cooking oil all over the floor and furniture. Thousands of pounds worth of food has had to be destroyed because the electric had to be switched off. “Not only that but we employ seven staff members here and we have had to tell those people that there is no work for them here at this time.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Time to talk about Irish unity’- says Michelle O’NeillSinn Fein’s northern leader told the Derry Post in March that now was the time for a serious discourse on Irish reunication.In an interview with the paper’s Editor Orla Mullan, the Mid Ulster MLA said she believes the Irish government needs to start planning for the unication of Ireland.The Sinn Fein vice president also said that unity would ‘lead to a better future for all the people who live on the island.’“Partition has failed our people and the country is moving beyond partition. In the event of a crash out Brexit, we have told Theresa May directly that she must put the question to the people to decide their constitutional future in a unity referendum.“It will impact on people, it will impact on them in terms of their rights, it’s going to impact on us in terms of how we move across this island, anybody who’s in business. Mid Ulster is a hive of business activity for the agri-food industry, for engineering. “Those companies are going to be interrupted in their in the trade patterns and how they move freely across this island. You could list all day long the implications of Brexit,” she said. googletag.cmd.push ‘A new dawn for local politics’ heralded by veteran republican coupleFormer Sinn Fein representatives, Anne and Francie Brolly told the Derry Post that a ‘new dawn’ for local politics was on the way when they both declared they would stand for Aontu in the local authority elections.The well-known Dungiven couple, who in the past represented Sinn Fein as a councillor and MLA respectively, left the party over a clash of viewpoint on the issue of abortion.Anne Brolly said: “People were coming to us telling us they had no one to vote for. Those people are entitled to a vote – that is what democracy is about.“I left the party I was in because I do not believe in it’s stance on abortion. I am against assisted suicide and abortion, which only devalues le. I left that party becauseI had stayed, I would have been endorsing that policy.” All-Ireland glory can inspire Slaughtneil community says winning captainThe captain of Slaughtneil’s All-Ireland wining camog’s told the Derry News in March this year that the town’s amazing on-field exploits can inspire the team’s youth players to create their own history in the years ahead.As the south Derry club celebrated yet another national GAA title, captain Aoe Ni Chaside told this newspaper: “Yesterday and today, there has been a lot of messages of congratulations coming in from dferent people appreciating what we have done. They probably know it more than us players at the minute.”Revealing that the club’s younger players formed a guard of honour for the winning team after their victory Aoe added: “There has been a lot of support and young people are seeing all that. Hopefully it will inspire them to keep winning, to keep doing well and to be proud of being from Slaughtneil.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a cagey encounter, Lavey led three times by two points but failed to convert three second-half goal chances. In the end it was Niall Duggans first point of the competition, in the th minute, that proved to be the winning score. Here is how the Lavey players performed. Jack Scullion – His spill that led to Adam McElwaines point was the only blot on an otherwise perfect competition that saw the converted outfield player keep three clean sheets. A quieter afternoon than what went before. googletag.cmd.push Shea ONeill – Bobbie McGettigan scored - across the previous three games but ONeill held him scoreless. He made a fine catch from a long ball in the first-half and was tough in the tackle. Ryan Farrell – Played in the full-back line on Mark Gallagher and while Farrell conceded possession on three occasions, didnt let him inside. Will feel hard done by on one of the frees he conceded. Joe Duggan – Lined out initially at centre-back on Adam McElwaine but dropped back into his customary sweeper role. Not tested as much as the earlier rounds but still sat back to shut off the space in front of Gallagher. googletag.cmd.push Enda Downey – Started at midfield and won the throw-in at the start of the second-half. His use of the ball and work-rate were equally brilliant, typied by a massive turnover to end a Termon counter-attack. Played mainly as a centre-back but had a spell at full-forward. Niall Duggan scores what proved the winner and won breaking ball from last kick out of game.Better team all round and able to win the grind Title number  out of  for Derry clubs #UMFT @lavey -@CLGAnTearmainn - pic BlzamXeD — Michael McMullan January ,     Ryan McGill – Lined out on Steve McDaid but it was McGill who came out on top of the battle. Popped up everywhere from wing-back to corner forward where he began the move for Jamie Duggan second point. Segdae Melaugh – Adam McElwaine scored a point off him but was replaced early on. Melaugh played in the midfield zone and had the legs to get forward to support the attack. Unlucky to see his goal chance was blocked by full-back Grant. James McGurk – The wing back fired over the opening point of the game and added a second later in the half. Got caught in possession in Termons maroon wall in the second-half but handled the ball more than most. A vital player in Laveys attacking outlet from defence, scoring from play in all three games. Cormac Collins –The Lavey skipper battled well against Jack Alcorn, who scored - against Emyvale. Made an strong run back to foul Conor Black on a Termon surge after Matthew Downey lost the ball with  minutes to go. Was on the end of a goal chance what flashed outside the post. Jamie Duggan – Despite being paired on Ryan McFadden, he scored two fine points while holding the Termon dangerman scoreless from play. He was here, there and everywhere to knit all the pieces of Laveys team together. Patrick McGurk – Small in stature, he was still able to execute one of the tackles of the game to setup Jamie Duggan for a point. Played off Calum Downey as a second inside forward before dropping deeper later in the game. Rory McGill – Had a hand in two Lavey points including a fine catch from a Scullion kick-out on the way to a free for Matthew Downey to chip over. Was strong on the run from defence and played up front in the closing stages. Niall Duggan – While others will grab the headlines, it was Niall Duggan who arguably won the game for Lavey. He had the courage to kick them into a two point lead and when possession was key during stoppage time he threw himself on a vital breaking ball, hurting himself in the process. Matthew Downey – A quieter afternoon in the scoring stakes but dig deeper and Downey had the mentality to work for the team. He won the ball for a Jamie Duggan score and instinctively laid off for Niall Duggans point late on. Had a goal chance brilliant saved by Maguire. Calum Downey – Its hard to remember him not winning a ball played to him over the three games. He was again the perfect focal point for the attack. Was involved directly in four scores of which the two he kicked himself were exceptional in their own way. Niall Rafferty – Came on in stoppage time for Niall Duggan.

The Radical Bookfair is an important event which gives a great opportunity to independent booksellers and publishers due to the availability to network and create links and new important contacts. “We welcome everyone to the Radical Bookfair with dferent political visions, ideas, practices and radical traditions. “We pride ourselves in creating a space for books of local, national and international interests including social and labour history as well as themes covering radical feminism, queer liberation, anarchism, Marxism, republicanism and environmentalism. “It is also a day in which a number of campaign groups have the opportunity to table stalls so as to highlight ongoing concerns such as human rights, environmental andsocial justice issues. This year we will be continuing with a series of book launches as well as several talks throughout the event which will again add to the overall community spirit that the book fair has created within a venue such as Pilots Row.

Facilitated by Marie Dunne, of Resilio, the event acknowledged the support provided to the Strengthening Families Programme by local professionals and illustrated the need for staff working in the community, voluntary and statutory sectors to look after their own mental health and wellbeing.The Strengthening Families Programme is an inter- nationally-proven, evidence-based family skills programme and whilst used worldwide for more than  years now it has been delivered locally since  by developing healthy communities, and is currently funded by Public Health Agency. Course delivery takes place through a team of trained facilitators drawn from a range of local agencies, who deliver parent, child and family sessions over a fourteen weeks period.For many people, raising children can be dficult unchartered territory, and it can be hard to find support. The Strengthening Families Programme helps parents identy risks that their teenagers face and help build in protective factors within the family home. The course was also designed to aid families build and strengthen their communication skills, identy and build on their strengths, family resilience and set clear rules and boundaries.Speaking at the end of the event, programme manager, Leona Bradley, said: “The Strengthening Families Programme not only provides excellent skills for families locally but also an opportunity for local agencies to work together in a unique interagency manner. “The team who help deliver Strengthening Families are not only hugely talented but their passion to improve the lives of people locally is inspiring. “Today was an opportunity to celebrate these staff and give them an opportunity to promote their own wellbeing and resilience. All too often we forget how much of themselves the community, voluntary and statutory sector workers give, particularly when working with families and young people and we are delighted to be able to give something back to them.’Praising the funders and the team of facilitators for the successful delivery of the course, she continued: ‘We would like to thank the Public Health Agency in funding this worthwhile programme and today’s event and acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the multiagency team of facilitators who successfully delivered the sessions.’This year a large-scale evaluation of the programme and its effects on local families has been commissioned by developing Healthy Communities. Any families who have engaged with the programme and would like to provide any feedback for the evaluation can contact programme manager Leona at  or leona@dhcni. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

He accepted this. He also contacted Colin McIlheneyand was given the same information.”\u2028J McGimpsey then set out three options for the government – doing nothing, getting the polling company to release some of the results while suppressing others, or getting the company to publish the full results.Advocating for the full results to be published, the civil servant said that one of the benefits of such a strategy would be that the poll – which had been secretly commissioned and controlled by the government – would “provide ‘independent’ verication to the loyal institution that parades in such areas are unwelcome by the signicant majority of the people living there”.\u2028“The fact that the NIO are responsible for this survey is confidential and will need to remain confidential to ensure its independence.“By retaining its confidentiality, the NIO can continue to argue its policy free from criticism against the results.”They said that in discussions with press officer Colin Ross about how to get the government poll into the public domain it was agreed that the polling company could give the poll to The Sunday Tribune but that “no attribution will be made to the NIO”.The minister was then presented with comments which could be released in his name in response to the poll.The civil servant suggested that the minister say that he welcomed the publication of the poll and had “read the results with interest”.It was also suggested that the minister mislead the public by saying: “The results of this independent survey may help inform all those engaged in discussion about parades...and form a basis on which an agreement based on compromise may be reached.”try catch  TrendingGame of Thrones NI actor Andrew Dunbar dies suddenlyThe full list of the  Northern Ireland New Yearrsquos Honours recipientsYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He called for officials including ldquoweirdos and misfits with odd skills, data scientists and policy experts to apply to a gmail accountthey think they fit the bill.Mr Cummings warned that there are ldquosome profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions and that he currently makes decisions ldquowell outside his ldquocircle of competence.And he says the need for change comes with Brexit requiring large policy and decision-making structure changes and a Government with an -strong majority having ldquolittle need to worry about short-term unpopularity.Under a subsection on hiring ldquosuper-talented weirdos, he writes that the Government needs ldquosome true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson with his senior aide Dominic Cummings  --Mr Cummingsrsquo post came after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their Whitehall jobs.Under ldquoseismic changes being planned by Number , she also said that civil servants are ldquowoefully unprepared for sweeping reforms that Mr Johnson is keen to push through.The General Secretary of the FDA union Dave Penman said Mr Cummings had not claried how new recruits would be selected or what their role within government would be.He told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe civil service is recruited on merit, itrsquos a really fundamental principle.ldquoYou are employed in the civil service because of what you can do, not what you believe.ldquoIf you surround yourself with people who are recruited simply because they believe the same as you believe, and whose employment is at your behest, is that the best way for the civil service or advisers to speak truth unto power ldquoI donrsquot think it is, and I think some of those approaches are quite dangerous as well.In a statement, he added: ldquoIt would be ironic , in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded iniduals ndash recruited for what they believe, not what they can do ndash and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want.Mr Penman also blamed officialsrsquo salary levels as being a restricting factor for recruitment, adding that the ldquogovernmentrsquos failure to pay a market rate restricts the pool.The former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake warned that any changes Mr Cummings may want to implement cannot be achieved overnight, but that the civil service ldquoshould be open to challenge, improvement and change.ldquoMy point would be Governments come in at this situation and the biggest risk for them is hubris ndash they think because theyrsquove won an election they can do everything and change everything overnight and it isnrsquot like that. If they donrsquot want to hear that then so be it.ldquoBut therersquos plenty of evidence that change is possible in the civil service, it was achieved when I was there, it has been achieved since, but you have to work with the civil service and try to carry them with the process of change, Lord Kerslake told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.He added: ldquoTherersquos a balancing act here between getting things done and also making changes to the way the civil service works and thatrsquos something theyrsquore going to have to work through, and I would advise them to work it through in some detail..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Dominic Cummings calls for  uweirdos u to apply for Downing Street jobs article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Heres how to get a refund on unwanted Christmas presents -

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
