Dr Bux, in considering the diagnosis, undertook a telephone consultation with the ill holidaymaker and diagnosed infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which he concluded was due to inadequate food preparation and food handling at the hotel.Karen Smith, Operations Manager for Beachcomber Tours, handled this claim and had concerns that Dr Bux\u0027s diagnosis differed from that of the doctor at the resort. She also discovered that Dr Bux\u0027s wife was a Partner at AMS Solicitors.              Dr Bux was found to be at fault for failing to disclose his solicitor wife Sehana (right) was a director for AMS, the solicitors firm which had commissioned him to act as a medical witness in county court claims (left: Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester)Further cases involved one claim in Fuerteventura where a patient suffered a rash in November 2015 and was treated in hospital on the island. In his report dated 26 July 2016, Dr Bux diagnosed the patient with an anaphylactic reaction secondary to infective gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning.A couple went on holiday to Benidorm in June 2015, and both complained of falling ill with food poisoning and both made a claim against TUI. Dr Bux produced reports dated 24 August 2016 and 25 August 2016 diagnosing both with infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which was caused by inadequate food preparation and handling, although he only spoke to them on the telephone.Allegations were found proven in each of the holiday cases, with Dr Bux failing to declare his personal relationship with his wife at AMS and diagnosing food poisoning without sufficient evidence.Tribunal chairman Julia Oakford said as Dr Bux\u0027s wife was a salaried partner at AMS, managing the litigation department, it was difficult to conclude she would have no knowledge or sight of the claims.The panel also ruled the doctor\u0027s actions were misleading, dishonest and financially motivated.She added: \u0027The tribunal found that Dr Bux diagnosed food poisoning alone as it was in his interest to write a positive report to enable him to sustain this stream of work.\u0027Expert witness Nigel Zoltie also criticised Dr Bux for circumcising the 15-month-old, referred to as Patient A, in a community setting.He said: \u0027It remains my opinion that all actions were likely to put Patient A at high risk of life-threatening complications that could only managed with great difficulty in the community. \u0027For a religious procedure these risks were unacceptable, and therefore the care was seriously below standard.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Culture Secretary refuses intervene BBC decision scrap free TV licences","story":"Share this article A BBC spokesman said: \u0027The licence fee ensures a universal BBC which serves everyone, is the most popular funding system among the public and is agreed as the method of funding the BBC for another eight years, so any debate about future funding is a long way off.\u0027This year the BBC faced even more criticism about the licence fee than usual when it announced that it would no longer fund free licences for all over-75s.The free licences were funded by the Government, but as part of the 2015 charter renewal negotiations, the responsibility was passed to the Corporation.         The BBC has come under intense pressure due to the popularity of subscription servicesThe BBC announced that from next June it would only fund licences for the 900,000 households on pension credit – meaning 3.7million would have to pay.Yesterday an analysis found that 1.7million pensioners face a cut in their living standards next year when the change comes in.State pensions are to rise by 3.9 per cent next year in line with the increase in average earnings. But calculations by insurers Royal London reveal that for many pensioners over the age of 75, much of this rise will be wiped out by the £154.50 a year they will have to spend on their TV licence.Royal London says that while most single people on a basic state pension will see their payment go up by £5.05 per week to £134.25, those having to pay their licence for the first time will lose £2.97 a week of the increase.It means that 1.7million single pensioners over 75 will only see a real increase in their pensions of 1.6 per cent next year – lower than the 1.7 per cent rate of inflation.

He decorated the outside of the chapel roof with foliage which he made from scratch by cutting each inidual leaf detail out of cardJon says that he hopes to one day write a guide book to the castle in the style of a conventional stately home.Each of the minute features he has installed so far have been made by hand which means that the rooms have often taken years to complete.Jon relies on using recycled materials from old cereal packets to egg boxes, which his neighbours often donate, to make the different parts of his beloved castle.He also collects small items of doll\u0027s house furniture to add to the model which is where most of the cost for the project comes from.For example, in the attic room he has a Dutch cabinet doll\u0027s house, which is on a 1:144 scale, and paid £300 for it because it was too intricate for him to make himself. Jon said he has never kept a record or receipts of the whole cost of the project but estimates that it is around £2,000 to £3,000.           The main staircase in the project took over a year to complete using seven layers of card. It is based on the staircase in the Jacobean manor Hatfield House in Hertfordshire         Hidden away underneath the staircase are the crowns and sceptres of monarchs resting on red and gold-detailed cushions which were also fashioned by Jon out of recycled materials         The intricate columns found throughout the castle were crafted from cardboard before being painted grey with yellow flecks to create a weathered stone effect Jon said: \u0027I\u0027ve worked on it whenever I\u0027ve been able to.\u0027It\u0027s tough to pinpoint my favourite part of the castle because each feature is taken from my favourite parts of real country houses so it\u0027s full of pleasure for me.\u0027I think the joy of the project is that I can make everything in the way I like.\u0027Jon estimates that if he ever finishes Hordle it will  four feet square and three feet high.He said: \u0027It\u0027s taken most of my life to complete.\u0027It all began with the great hall when I was a boy. My dad cut the frames out in plywood and I built it from there.\u0027I went to dolls house fairs and collected items over time.\u0027When I was at university the hall just lay in my brother\u0027s shed pretty much unloved.\u0027I did bits and pieces on it but it all changed eleven years ago when I moved into my current flat.

Wright allegedly plotted with Guiseppe Pagliara and Dax Price (right) to profit from playersWright, 53, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, denies two charges of accepting a bribe in contravention of the Bribery Act 2000. Pagliara, 64, of Bury, Greater Manchester, and Price, 48, of Sittingbourne, Kent, both deny two counts of paying and facilitating a bribe under the same act. The court heard that undercover journalist Claire Newell, using the pseudonym Claire Taylor, posed as a representative of a fake sports management company named Meiran, and contacted Pagliara in May 2016 pretending to want to invest in football players in the UK.Prosecutor Mr O\u0027Neill explained that, across a series of meetings, emails and texts, Pagliara, originally from Genoa in Italy, and Price, allegedly proposed schemes which saw them becoming players\u0027 agents, buying them and placing them at clubs.They would maintain ownership of a player, and profit from his onward sale, which Mr O\u0027Neill said was \u0027all to be facilitated by bribery\u0027.The court was told that such \u0027third party ownership\u0027 set-ups were banned by the English Football Association (FA) in 2009 and by Fifa, the football world-governing body, in 2015.In August 2016, when all three defendants were present, Mr O\u0027Neill said Wright received \u0027an envelope containing £5,000 in cash\u0027 in return for \u0027commercial information about Barnsley FC\u0027s players\u0027.The jury heard that Price and Pagliara, who has never been registered as a football agent with the FA, set up an introduction with Wright, who allegedly accepted payment to encourage players to appoint Price and Pagliara as their agents and help place players at Barnsley.         The court heard the case centres on the same newspaper investigation which led Sam Allardyce to resign as England managerMr O\u0027Neill said Price and Pagliara \u0027explicitly discussed the payment of future sums to Mr Wright\u0027.The court was told that from their first meeting with the undercover journalist, Price and Pagliara \u0027revealed their awareness of corrupt practices in the football transfer market and discussed their willingness to be involved in such activities\u0027.Mr O\u0027Neill said the men repeatedly used the phrase \u0027looking after people\u0027 when discussing alleged corruption across the football world.He said Wright had helped arrange a meeting for the owner of Barnsley to be introduced to Price and Pagliara, where the Italian would pretend to be an interpreter, because he did not want it to be known that a previous finding of corruption had been made against him in Italy by the Italian Football Federation.Mr O\u0027Neill said Wright \u0027rather than alerting his employers to this ruse, played along with the facade\u0027.The jury heard that at their first meeting with the undercover journalist, Price claimed football managers received \u0027back-handers\u0027 for player-signing deals.He said: \u0027It\u0027s not corruption but you know it is corruption... because obviously at the end of the day they\u0027re just putting every deal through the manager and they\u0027re obviously copping the money for it.\u0027The jury were taken through transcripts of conversations with Pagliara and Price, secretly recorded during the Daily Telegraph\u0027s investigation, which were later passed to the City of London Police.The trial continues. "},{"url":null,"title":"Primark pulls tea towels shelves feature London landmarks wrong place","story":"Share this article There is also a spelling mistake with \u0027Westminster\u0027 spelled \u0027Westminister, while an apostrophe is missing from St Paul\u0027s.Other geographical blunders include picturing The London Eye north of the river when it should be the south of it. While The Gherkin and St Paul\u0027s Cathedral crop up on the wrong side of Tower Bridge. Vic Norman, who does historical walking tours in London, said: \u0027It\u0027s not only geographically challenged, the spelling and punctuation need a makeover.

A study by a Colorado academic reveals seven types of \u0027sugar\u0027 relationships, ranging from the sex-for-money arrangements to purely platonic affairs\u0027Sugar dating,\u0027 the most common form of sugaring, combines the intertwined life of companionship with sex. In this case, most women receive an allowance on a weekly, monthly, or as-needed basis. The sums could range from $200 to several thousands of dollars a month, Schull noted. Sugar friendships are mutually beneficial relationships with someone the women consider a friend.          Maren Shcull, PhD assistant professor at University of Colorado Denver, (pictured), explored the kind of activities the women were involved inBenefactors in these arrangements are often a part of the women’s lives already or soon become a part of it. \u0027Sugar friendships with sexual benefits\u0027 is more unstructured. In some cases, benefactors pay for all living expenses for the women, including rent, cell phone bills, clothing, cars, and vacations.Finally, Scull found that some of these relationships involved two people who hoped to end up together, with the woman taken care of for the rest of her life, in a category she named \u0027pragmatic love.\u0027\u0027When we lump sugar relationships together as prostitution, it deviantizes and criminalizes these relationships,\u0027 said Scull. \u0027We were missing how they are often organic and involve genuine, emotional connection. \u0027Many of the women didn’t intend on having a benefactor.

This is welcome. Just like the pound which jumped, when I saw the news I jumped.I would very much like to see an agreement being reached”I wouldn’t dare predict how Brexit will play out. But City analysts have to calculate these things.But what happens next? Assuming it’s not ratified, Harvey sees four ways it could play out -- including Johnson winning a general election and then pushing his deal through parliament.But he cautions that there is “considerable uncertainty” about how a November election would play out.Some opinion polls suggest a substantial Conservative lead while others show a smaller lead. In general, however, the Conservatives’ polling performance has improved since Mr Johnson became leader. Importantly, and as discussed above, only one scenario would reintroduce the risk of a no deal Brexit: that of the Conservatives forming a minority government with the support of the Brexit PartyDUP.David Malpass, the World Bank president, says a Brexit deal will be good for poor countries because it will end the uncertainty that has led to slower growth.“If there were clarity it would help the growth outlook quite a bit” Malpass said at a press conference in Washington. Malpass explained that problems in advanced economies have rippled across the globe:“Uncertainty affects development because part of the slowdown in the developing world is related to the slowdown in the developed world. Europe has slowed significantly. If there was more certainty that would be very helpful.” Even by recent standards, this has been a very volatile day for the pound.It’s traded in a range of nearly two and half cents against the US dollar today, as hopes of a Brexit breakthrough surged, then subsided.The pound has also fallen back against the euro.Having hit a five-month high this morning, sterling is now down three-quarters of a eurocent at €1.151.Traders are concluding that MPs may well not pass Johnson’s deal on Saturday.Passing a Brexit deal would be “constructive” for the UK’s credit rating, says S\u0026ampP.The credit rating agency currently has a ‘negative’ rating on Britain, essentially a threat to downgrade the country - potentially pushing up borrowing costs.S\u0026ampP has already downgraded the UK after the 2016 EU referendum, due to the damage that Brexit could cause.“This is constructive news, also for the rating,”“Even with a deal you still have enormous questions about, for example, UK financial services firms’ access to the (EU) single market.” The City’s Brexit optimism is now firmly fizzling out, as the DUP insists it won’t back Johnson’s deal.The pound has dropped steadily in recent minutes, and is now back below $1.28, down almost half a cent today (and two cents below its peak this morning)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626b6eae38d5a69efad832ebaca159c9c79db536/0_904_4342_2606/master/4342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eca549027cbe59751a82d40576b2bf5","title":"a way of learning from everything the rise of the city critic","story":"Criticism of food and the arts has long flourished. In our increasingly urban world, perhaps city criticism should be recognised as distinct and necessary“On any person who desires such queer prizes, New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy,” wrote EB White in his 1949 essay, Here Is New York.White sizes up both the positive and negative potential of the teeming Manhattan with the familiarity of a native and the heightened awareness of a visitor. A longtime contributor to the New Yorker magazine, White also wrote the classic children’s book Charlotte’s Web and co-wrote the influential writing guide The Elements of Style. In Here Is New York, he takes that versatility further, giving us a new way of seeing the city in an early example of what we might today call city criticism.Given how long we’ve relied on the work of critics on film, music, food, and much else besides, as well as the ever-increasing relevance of cities in our lives, it’s time we recognised city criticism as its own distinct category of writing. But what is city criticism — or rather, what isn’t it?Despite dealing with the built environment, it isn’t architecture criticism, not in the sense of treating structures like sculptures, indulging in a “collective obsession with idiosyncratic starchitect buildings,” writes Globe and Mail architecture critic Alex Bozikovic. Architecture matters in city criticism only to the extent that it explores “what’s designed and built in the context of a broader narrative,” writes Curbed urbanism editor Alissa Walker. “What’s happening in the surrounding community, what political efforts hindered progress, and, conceding all those externalities, can the project still best serve the audience that it is intended to serve?”Yet city criticism isn’t reportage. Like movie or restaurant reviewers, city critics write from their own perspectives, in distinctive voices enriched by knowledge and experience, but wearing their erudition lightly. City critics understand that places reveal themselves through details encountered by chance, glimpsed and overheard.Iain Sinclair’s lifetime of walking London has produced a series of books notable for their intensity, as well as their density, of historical, cultural, and political observations. Whether the length of the entire M25 or of Sinclair’s neighbourhood of Hackney, his walks lead to disquisitions on not just redevelopment, gentrification and bus routes, but terrorism and asylums and alchemy and Hitchcock – as well as furious denunciations of London’s latter-day disfigurement by money and mega-projects.The term psychogeography, long associated with Sinclair’s work, has gone unexpectedly mainstream: many now apply it to their own artistic and peripatetic endeavours as they once called themselves flâneurs, those who walk city streets to observe urban society. In Lights Out for the Territory Sinclair describes the flâneur as “a stubborn creature, less interested in texture and fabric, eavesdropping on philosophical conversation pieces than noticing everything.” That mandate, taken on by German philosopher and essayist Walter Benjamin decades earlier, resulted in The Arcades Project: a densely referential, nearly thousand-page examination of the shopping arcades of late 19th- and early 20th-century Paris, perhaps the first and most ambitious work of city criticism.The Arcades Project was left unfinished at the time of Benjamin’s death in 1940. Here Is New York came at the end of that decade, and 1961 saw the publication of two volumes that still have much to teach us about the possibilities of city criticism: urban historian Lewis Mumford’s The City in History, which puts cities in context, and journalist Jane Jacobs’ The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which makes them a subject of activism.The most intellectually daring and flamboyant venture into city criticism yet came ten years thereafter, when architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies, a contrarian yet enduring analysis of and argument for a place most critics and other city-minded intellectuals had long written off as a dysfunctional and tasteless, a grotesquely overgrown postwar suburb.“Los Angeles threatens the intellectual repose and professional livelihood of many architects, artists, planners, and environmentalists because it breaks the rules of urban design that they promulgate in works and writings and teach to their students,” writes Banham:In so far as Los Angeles performs the functions of a great city, in terms of size, cosmopolitan style, creative energy, international influence, distinctive way of life and corporate personality, to the extent that Los Angeles has these qualities, then to that same extent all the most admired theorists of the present century, from the Futurists and Le Corbusier to Jane Jacobs and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, have been wrong.”Welsh travel writer Jan Morris went beyond the single city in an attempt to describe “the entire urban world”. The project led her to the lively but haunting rebuilt Hiroshima – missing an essential element “like salt with your victuals, or eyes in a beautiful face” – and to London, where “through the dingy and the disagreeable, the fantastic habitually looms.” Hong Kong she found “indefensible, militarily and economically, and it lives half on trust and half on cynicism,” while of her beloved Venice, which since the turn of the 19th century “has chiefly existed to be stared at”, she declared: “Let her sink.”City criticism is not travel writing, but it should take Morris’ work as a model of how to let readers see a city through the writer’s eyes. It should also pry loose the clichés that inevitably adhere to a place, as when Morris came to Los Angeles, eschewed references to stardom and sprawl, and described the city as where “the lost American faith in machines and materialism built its own astonishing monument.”Sometimes city criticism has tangible effects. Nearly 60 years after its publication, The Death and Life of Great American Cities continues to open readers’ eyes to the unplanned “ballet of the good city sidewalk” that Jacobs observed in her native New York City: in the students, shop owners, commuters and delivery people, “the inidual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole”.But Jacobs also raised the alarm about the threatened eradication of that finely grained street life by New York’s so-called master builder of freeways and high-rises, the urban planner Robert Moses. Later in the decade, she got involved in the struggle against Moses, repeatedly protesting against his plan to run the Lower Manhattan Expressway through her neighbourhood of Greenwich Village. After fighting the project to its death she moved to Toronto, a city that provided more subjects for her criticism and more development projects – a new freeway, a waterfront bridge – to publicly oppose.Some city critics will follow Jacobs’ example and seek to influence the shape of cities, while others will seek only to understand it. The architects Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour exemplify that method in 1972’s Learning from Las Vegas, a subject they felt obliged to justify: “We look backward at history and tradition to go forward we can also look downward to go upward,” they write. “Withholding judgment may be used as a tool to make later judgment more sensitive. This is a way of learning from everything.”Indeed, city critics should write about everything: their subject is a nexus of subjects. Ada Louise Huxtable concerned herself with not just her official beat of architecture at the New York Times and later the Wall Street Journal, but also development economics and the policy of land use and transportation the ultra-opinionated Ian Nairn savaged postwar Britain’s uninspired buildings and even less inspired city planning the New Yorker’s architecture critic Mumford wrote about highways, housing and planning, but also literature, technology and politics. And longtime writer on the built environment Karrie Jacobs points out that most writers on cities currently “either focus on urban problems or urban pleasures,” whereas “in truth, the problems and the pleasures have a symbiotic relationship,” which any critic worthy of the title understands.What would a more fully developed city criticism have to offer? Most who write about cities agree on one thing: helping effect change. The British writer Owen Hatherley, a sometime  Cities contributor who has looked often at post-Soviet urban landscapes, argues for city criticism to “help us understand cities, and how they have been shaped by very particular decisions, choices and interests, and that they can be changed, influenced and transformed in turn.” Nikil Saval, the Indian-American writer, puts capitalism in his crosshairs, since “you can often see examples of our economic system’s mutations and depredations in how cities and city politics work”. Spacing magazine’s Shawn Micallef sees his mission “to get people to really see, experience and live their city,” since they “won’t fight for something to be better if they haven’t yet fallen in love with it.” Walker underscores the importance of advocating for “the people who keep the city running.”But city critics should be be writers above all else. And though the past decade has seen an abundance of city-related content in print and online, cities need writers more than ever. That is, cities need to be written about well and in a way that lasts, not merely to spot trends, air grievances, or enter technocratic squabbles. Readers will only tolerate so much more one-dimensional discussion before developing city fatigue, and history has shown what happens to cities when the public loses interest in them. Hence the city critic’s mandate to keep readers engaged and thinking in the long term by treating the city as not just as a fashionable place to live and work, nor as an ideological, economic, and social battleground, but as one of the very richest, most stimulating subjects available.Unlike service journalism, city criticism must remain fresh while the city changes over time unlike academic theory, it must be written for the general public unlike activism, it must keep the distance necessary for keen, aesthetically sensitive observation. City critics must be invested in not just buildings, infrastructure, and public space, but in words, sentences, and the play of ideas. Only then can they write like EB White did on New York’s paradoxical generosity of privacy:It is this largesse that accounts for the presence within the city’s walls of a considerable section of the population for the residents of Manhattan are to a large extent strangers who have pulled up stakes somewhere and come to town, seeking sanctuary or fulfilment or some greater or lesser grail. The capacity to make such dubious gifs is a mysterious quality of New York. It can destroy an inidual, or it can fulfil him, depending a good deal on luck.”Despite having been written 70 years ago, the observation holds up today – though city critics to come, taking a page from each of these writers and others besides, should feel free to argue otherwise.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de8c1eba507095aef90ddbc1d00e235cecd14d9c/0_864_2964_1778/master/2964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d5e7bd4904e7c2e9e5534b83482fdcd","title":"brexit deal referendum","story":"The red hand of Ulster says no. Their “blood-red line” has been crossed by putting a hard customs border down the Irish Sea, iding them from the rest of the UK. They have lost the veto they wanted, reduced to a vote only held four years after the dual customs union comes into effect, aligned with the EU – and even then, they would have to wait for another two-year cooling-off period.These devilishly good DUP negotiators usually succeed because their No Surrender reputation has the other side of the table believing their stony faces are unmovable. But this time it looks as though Boris Johnson has thrown them under another of his mendacious buses. Of course this could be a last-minute DUP bluff. There are rumours not only of a new medical school and a motorway, but also a daintily gift-wrapped “peace fund”, paid by the UK with EU contributions via the Irish government. However, the biblically well-versed DUP won’t be trading their birthright for that mess of pottage.If no means no, that’s a heavy blow for Johnson – but even with DUP votes he can’t know if there are the numbers to push the deal through parliament. Johnson is back exactly where Theresa May was at Chequers with an EU deal agreed only to be blocked at Westminster – it would be a dose of his own medicine, as he was her prime rebel. Besides, his deal is far worse than May’s for the many Tory soft-leaver MPs who were once assured the UK would always keep close to Europe: this makes all borders rock hard, a lethal barrier to vital just-in-time trade.ERG Europhobes may like this deal better than the last, but they have been mainlining hopes of a no-deal crash out. Will they follow the DUP lead, as they once promised? Then up jumps Nigel Farage to declare “the ‘new deal’ is not Brexit”, frightening the life out of Tory MPs in marginal seats.Johnson chose to try to appease the ERGs, abandoning hope of those 19 Labour MPs who wrote to the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, backing a deal if it met their red lines. None of the red lines required by Stephen Kinnock and the others have been met, as “level playing field” alignment on regulations is moved from the withdrawal agreement into the non-binding political statement. As Downing Street asserts through a source to Robert Peston: “Britain is out of all EU laws. We will be able to change our laws in a huge number of areas from product standards to fishing rules and farming subsidies where we are currently bound by EU rules.” Just so. That is precisely what the Europhobes always wanted, the deregulated purpose of the whole Brexit fandango. Food safety and working conditions, traditionally well ahead of UK standards, will now be at the mercy of this Brexit government. Very few in Labour could tolerate that.This deal unites Labour, and even fires up Jeremy Corbyn to cast aside his ancient scepticism and at last put his shoulder to the cause of killing it off. Today Labour was calling for a confirmatory referendum: ask the voters if this is really what they want? As Corbyn says, this deal “risks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers’ rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations”.There is a tide in politics, a natural surge towards resolution after years of excruciation and paralysis. Is the Get It Done sentiment so strong at Westminster that it will sweep aside doubters on all sides? MPs know that nothing is “done” if they sign up to Johnson’s deal: it’s only the beginning of unending torment over the economy-defining negotiations on customs, tariffs and regulations, where as an outsider the UK will have the weakest hand. Brexeternity beckons.Johnson may not get his vote, and his own absurd “die in a ditch” pledges will make a forced extension a humiliation. The last chance to get his deal agreed would be to accept the Kyle-Wilson amendment for a confirmatory referendum ballot, which would see the Commons overwhelmingly pass it. That ends the impasse once and for all. If leave wins again, the agreement is ready to sign the next day – and those long, hard future negotiations begin. If remain wins, Brexit could be stopped in its tracks.Labour would whip its MPs to back it, along with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru – plus a growing numbers of Tories of the Dominic GrieveJustine Greening variety.Many shudder at the prospect of five long months of a referendum campaign that would be more bitter, more mendacious and savage than the last. But as hundreds of thousands of People’s Vote marchers file past parliament as it sits on Saturday, the worthwhile prize is a vote to stop Brexit dead: 204 polls for the past two years have put remain ahead, only seven for leave, with 15 ties – according to YouGov analysis for the Evening Standard.A packed Labour for a Public Vote meeting in the Commons last night discussed ways to run a grassroots campaign, making the remain side a fiery insurgency, with greater input from young people and women it could hardly be worse than the 2016 fiasco. But if leave were to win, that too would be a necessary catharsis. Remainers would just have to live with it, in the hope of drawing gradually closer to Europe again over the years.A referendum can’t resolve the deep national rift, but it can clear the fetid air that has asphyxiated all political life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f40e8f3a8b79a3179dc869732051c166fbc24d1/492_207_5268_3161/master/5268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264e02f1c31cafbf41f4cf58e2042f6a","title":"free tv licence ends over 75s bbc","story":"The government should reverse this unkind decision, which will rob many older people of their chief companionIt’s not the biggest austerity measure this decade, and it certainly won’t gain the most attention, but there’s one Conservative cut that’s quietly lining up to cause significant harm: taking the free TV licence away from people over the age of 75.The free licences were introduced by Labour in 1999 as part of a plan to improve conditions for pensioners, with the cost funded by government. But in 2015, the Conservatives announced they would phase this out by 2020 and push the financial burden on to the BBC, despite making a manifesto promise to keep up the £745m a year funding. Unable to cover the cost, and after a lengthy consultation, the BBC says it will need all those aged 75 or over to pay the £154.50 annual fee from next June, apart from those who can show they claim the means-tested pension credit.Now new research by Labour from the House of Commons library estimates that more than half a million older people with dementia could lose their free licence as a result of the policy. That includes 140,000 aged 90 or over.This has always been a cruel cut, and the latest research confirms it. For many, the TV is more than a box in the corner of the room: it’s a friendly voice, when you’ve not talked to someone in a week, or a humming light in a dark night. Four out of 10 older people say television is “their main company”, something that is all the more the case for the half of all over-75s who live with a disability. That it’s affecting those with dementia – who may well struggle to fill in the forms – is not only a sign of how low the policy sinks but of how flawed means testing is as a solution. Means testing is notoriously complex it’s estimated it would cost £72m to administer the new system, money that could be spent helping older and isolated people. We also know that means testing leads to large numbers of those in need missing out some are in hardship but don’t meet the strict poverty threshold, and some don’t know about the benefits, while others are reluctant to claim (frequently the case with older people, who often internalise a desire to “stand on their own two feet”).Besides, this is a matter of principle as much as practicality. That some retirees are wealthy is often used as an argument against blanket benefits, but the universal provision at the centre of free licences holds great value: no matter who you are, all older pensioners are entitled to a dignified retirement.Removing the free TV licence is more chipping away at social programmes that have been dismantled in recent years, something that is all the more grim at a time of growing pensioner hardship. The number of pensioners in poverty has risen from 1.6 million three years ago to 1.9 million, and is estimated to top 2 million by 2022. As Gordon Brown, who as chancellor introduced the free licence, has warned, cutting this support becomes worse still when you consider failure to pay a TV licence is a criminal (not civil) offence, resulting in a fine or even imprisonment. It is not outlandish to imagine an 80-year-old hauled to a magistrates hearing because they have lost their free licence and failed to pay up: one in every 10 court cases is already over non-payment of TV licences. The issue with the TV licence support scheme has never been that it is too generous, but that it is not quite generous enough. Disabled and chronically ill people of working age can be just as likely to be isolated because of poor health and poverty, but they don’t get the same support as their older counterparts. I’ve spoken to several disabled people in recent years who have had to give up their television because they could no longer afford the licence, often owing to having their disability benefit cut. Already isolated, their only social lifeline was removed. You only have to talk to those who have been caught without a TV licence to know the system too often essentially criminalises people for being poor, unwell or even illiterate.Boris Johnson seems keen to announce public spending pledges – why not reverse the decision to end the free TV licence? If humane reasons aren’t enough, consider the economic arguments. Like many social programmes, it’s not a stretch to imagine that the free licence ultimately saves the government money a London School of Economics study of older people in 2017 found loneliness costs £6,000 per person in health costs and pressure on local services, and for every £1 spent in preventing loneliness there are up to £3 of savings. It’s often said that austerity measures are implemented by governments that know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. As isolated older people risk losing their only window on to the outside world, ministers might want to consider what really matters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48d9018fabf8ee03a023c2a84bbc9b035acef11b/160_596_2634_1580/master/2634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627c61ec58bf927a858c9a6af55d4948","title":"labour nationalisation debated cbi analysis","story":"The CBI’s flawed analysis ignored all the benefits of the party’s flagship policyIt’s hard to unite nationalisation advocates and sceptics. But the Confederation of British Industry has managed to do just that, getting into hot water this week with an unsubstantiated claim that the Labour party’s plans to renationalise utilities would cost £196bn. These kinds of big numbers get media attention and help drive a narrative, particularly when they come from an establishment organisation such as the CBI. But by presenting an unbalanced view it has lost out on an opportunity for genuinely useful public debate.The organisation, which lobbies on behalf of British business, has already been forced by Labour to admit its mistake. The analysis assumed that a Labour government would purchase the rail industry’s rolling stock – trains that are privately held and leased to rail operating companies – even though this is not party policy. While this mistake is important, as it has misled the public, its effect on the overall figure is likely to be relatively small. Even more fundamentally, the analysis only assesses the costs of nationalisation, rather than the potential benefits. It does not take into account income that would be generated by the companies brought back into public ownership – from ticket sales or energy and water bills, for instance. While the CBI was happy to reference future costs, including maintenance, running costs and investments, it hadn’t considered the asset side of the balance sheet.That’s a shame, because a genuine debate on public and private ownership would be welcome. There are legitimate questions about which industries and companies should be publicly owned, which ones should be in private hands and indeed whether alternative models such as community or cooperative ownership would deliver better outcomes. Those questions should consider not just the cost to government but also who benefits and loses in society from different ownership models – both financially and in terms of who has control over the economy. They should consider who will best manage services that we all rely on and ensure sufficient investment for the future. They should also consider assets as well as liabilities.The CBI is upfront about omitting the potential benefits of nationalisation. But if it wishes to be considered a trustworthy and fair voice in our public debate, that simply isn’t good enough. Voters cannot be expected to dig into the details and check how the big figures are calculated. Even if they wanted to, they would not be able to fully assess the CBI’s claims. Worryingly, the group has said its members “do not feel comfortable” explaining how they got to the total of £196bn. As the parties gear up for a potential general election, there will be many more claims and counter-claims to come. The business lobby group’s eagerness to produce news splashes on Labour’s policy plans suggests it believes it could be a close outcome. But rather than publishing partial analyses, the CBI should focus on the real questions at hand. With trust in business reaching record lows in the past few years, interventions such as this will do little for the strained relationship between it and the rest of society.• Carys Roberts is chief economist and head of the Centre for Economic Justice at the Institute for Public Policy Research"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5be196b54a2962e1a8382a662080fe76138855ce/179_0_5022_3015/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0928611701de36fb9e2c2245fa6030f","title":"wildlife photographer of the year 2019 winners in pictures","story":"Hailing from the Chinese province of Qinghai, Yongqing Bao has won the prestigious wildlife photographer of the year 2019 title for his image The Moment, which frames the standoff between a Tibetan fox and a marmot.

At the time it seemed jarring, and in retrospect very much not what was needed but it’s not the worst of the bunch – González Iñárritu gets nul points for incorporating footage of people jumping from the collapsing World Trade Center in a soundimage collage.A somewhat supercilious satire on the property-owning middle classes that Loach later admitted he was the wrong director for: a little bit Fassbinder, a little bit Gurney Slade. It played into Loach’s favourite theme – the little man against the system – but the director’s instincts are not best served by wackiness. A shame, as it throws away a great lead performance by Ken Jones, a regular Loach collaborator, and later immortalised as the prison snitch Ives in Porridge.Not an adaptation of the Robert Harris alternative-history novel, but a patchy account of an East German musician as unhappy under communism as he is in the west. This is Loach’s signature theme – systems and authority of any kind are open to abuse – but he is never at his best with non-English-speaking characters and this film (almost entirely in German) is not exactly a triumph.Another package film, with Loach directing the final third after chunks from Ermanno Olmi (The Tree of Wooden Clogs) and Abbas Kiarostami. It’s a clever idea – train tickets as a symbol for wider social permissions – and Loach’s bit is nice but slight, with a bunch of Celtic fans squabbling among themselves whether to help an Albanian migrant family.The earliest of Loach’s Wednesday Plays to survive shows his early style in full flow. A talky, digressive piece, this anti-death penalty broadside is infused with a jittery hyperactive energy as Loach sought to overcome the staid traditions of television drama. It’s a bit on the stagey side, with lots of cockney chat, but the final execution scene, when poor Tony Selby is strung up for killing a prison officer, still packs a hell of a punch.Loach may not be an obvious football man, but it’s a thread that runs through his work. This innovative mix of drama and documentary pleasingly focuses on a cult figure from Everton’s mid-60s cup-winning side: the Scottish midfielder Alex Young. Loach (as ever) is more interested in the fans and how football folds into their lives (more good work from Ken Jones), with real-life footage of Everton personnel (including Young) talking to camera about their lives. In truth, it doesn’t amount to all that much, but texturally it’s still pretty interesting.Loach really nailed his political colours to the mast with this script by the Trotskyist former docker Jim Allen, and in doing so proved that the intricacies of an industrial dispute could be material for compelling, if not exactly exhilarating, drama. Nevertheless, this was evidence that Loach had achieved what he had clearly been aiming at for some time: acting so planed down it was indistinguishable from reality.You can see the attraction of the Nicaraguan civil war: one of the great international causes of the 80s. The involvement of Robert Carlyle, fresh from Trainspotting, gave this film a shot in the arm, although the somewhat saucer-eyed approach to the Latin characters – particularly Carla herself, with whose exotic mystery Carlyle’s bus driver falls in love – doesn’t do the film many favours.An uncomplicated, comfort-zone paean to the Irish communist Jimmy Gralton, whose brand of free-thinking is too much for the local worthies in 1930s Ireland. There’s not much light and shade here: Gralton (Barry Ward) is your standard crinkle-eyed nice-guy, a sacrificial lamb to the republic’s new intolerance.Loach’s mature, unadorned style emerged with this account of a labour dispute in north-west England, a BBC Play for Today that is essentially a lightly fictionalised treatment of the 1970 Pilkington glass strike. It recreates the smoke-filled rooms and committee discussions, establishing that the unions and management are both conspiring to shore up a system that keeps the ordinary workers in their place. Compared to The Big Flame, which covers not dissimilar ground, this is a sober, unblinking treatment, eliminating the flourishes of his 60s work. Heavy-duty stuff.While there is something fundamentally naive in this film’s analysis of mental illness – merging RD Laing’s anti-organic thesis with his own politics, Loach aims to pin responsibility for its subject’s schizophrenia on “social conditions”, namely, Kate’s poor relationship with her mother – this is high-achieving formally. Formatted as a documentary, with a stream of “interviews” and voiceover, this is fiction disguised very convincingly as fact. Unusually, Loach slips into point-of-view as the final ECT scenes approach.This one is a bit of an outrider. Loach scored something of a coup by casting the Manchester United legend Eric Cantona as a sort of Play It Again, Sam-style dope-fuelled fantasy adviser to a harassed Mancunian postman. It’s got its strong points, but the required wackiness isn’t always there.Named after the road into Baghdad airport, Loach’s assault on the west’s murky activities in Iraq focuses on the outsourcing of fighting and the subsequent corporate cover-up. It is one of his more conventional-looking films, and takes on a big target – possibly too big for the scale of film Loach is able to mount.A remakereworking of In Two Minds, framed as a more traditional dramatic narrative and with the central character’s troubled mindset more obviously triggered by the generation gap and the abortion she was made to have. Although this film follows a similar trajectory, finding environmental and social causes for her erratic behaviour, leading to seemingly brutal ECT treatment, Loach wisely retreats a little from the wider mental-illness thesis of the original.A lightweight entry in Loach’s Scottish cycle: a violent tearaway (played by Paul Brannigan) resolves to get out of the Glasgow gang life by stealing some valuable whisky. This actually has a happy ending (of sorts), but Loach doesn’t quite succeed in making a basically vicious central character likable.This film contains one of the few non-white lead characters in Loach’s work: Casim, son of Pakistani immigrants, who embarks on a forbidden relationship with Catholic school teacher Roisin. Loach’s target, as ever, is the system of control that prevents ordinary people from achieving freedom in their lives this inter-ethnic romance does a decent job in exploring religion and immigrant culture, but it isn’t Loach’s natural habitat.A likable comedy from Loach’s early-90s resurgence, working from a Jim Allen script about an on-his-uppers chancer trying to scrape together enough money for a communion dress for his daughter. It’s not one of his most resonant films, but is basically good natured and an excellent example of the director’s unerring ability to get great performances from first-timers: the lead is Bruce Jones, who was a club-circuit comic at the time.Another great spot from Loach: Crissy Rock, another former club comic, is tremendous as self-destructive mum Maggie, who has lost four of her children to social services after a string of disastrous relationships. Loach, characteristically, is doing his utmost to extract sympathy for one of life’s casualties there is little sympathy to spare for the council workers trying to deal with her.In its day, this adaptation of Nell Dunn’s stories for the Wednesday Play spot was notorious for its agonised abortionmiscarriage sequence but there’s more to this than outrage. Like its predecessor Three Clear Sundays, this is a rangy, digressive portrait of street life here it is about three young women working in a wash-house in Battersea and is a depiction of a marginalised, under-represented community that hums with life. The abortion itself is interestingly consequence-free the three leads (who include Carol White in her first Loach role) are all great.One of Loach’s few attempts to make a putatively commercial “family film”: this is adapted from Leon Garfield’s book about a kid in the 18th century who falls in with an itinerant, hulking villain (the Black Jack of the title), rescues a girl who has been sent to the madhouse and works for a funfair. It is unusual, interesting material for a children’s film, even by 70s standards, but the flat, ultra-naturalistic acting style Loach employed works against the extravagant storyline: the whole thing could have been a bit more rollicking.Loach held his nose and went to the US to make this statement-film about exploitation of immigrant workers in Los Angeles. It stars Adrien Brody as a union organiser who (wouldn’t you know it?) falls in love with one of the women he is defending. Even so, Loach lands some telling sledgehammer blows, even if – outside his UK and Ireland comfort zone – much of his customary nuance is absent.In retrospect, this looks like an early emanation of the nostalgia-socialism that helped pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour leadership triumph two years later. A compendium of interviews of warhorse campaigners and archive-clip history about Clement Attlee’s landslide victory in 1945, this is just about the only Loach documentary expressly aimed at the cinema. Although its contemporary political purpose is rather over-evident, it is still a stirring vision of what used to be, and what many hoped could be again.A conspiracy thriller that marked Loach’s return to feature film-making after a difficult 1980s spent trying (and often failing) to get his TV projects broadcast. As with the later Route Irish, Loach goes for a relatively mainstream style to tell an incendiary political story: here it is about British military collusion in the murder of a human rights lawyer (clearly related to the real-life killing of Pat Finucane). It is a bit by-the-numbers stylewise, but it re-established Loach as a radical force.A feature-length drama made for ITV, adapted from a Barry Hines novel, and about as pared-down a piece as Loach is ever likely to make. Phil Askham is the eponymous estate worker, caught between competing loyalties and as out of place down the pub with the poacher-forgiving locals as with the capped-and-Barboured shooting gentry. There is no plot to speak of: just an incremental progression of incident (some, like rabbit hunting with ferrets, looks pretty gruesome for modern sensibilities), but it’s remarkable all the same: a working life in collision with muddy, bloody nature.Unusually, this full-length feature had its UK premiere on TV perhaps reflecting the popular nature of its subject: rail privatisation. Loach has always admired “railwaymen” for their tight organisation and solidarity: he clearly enjoyed bringing out their camaraderie in an appealing film that had self-evident real-world parallels. Staffed with the customary lineup of club comics and singers turned actors, this is Loach in confident, mid-season form.The pick of Loach’s 1960s TV work, and not just for the galvanising effect it had on the then, and still, current concerns over homelessness. Carol White is tremendous as the mother who desperately tries to hang on to her children as her domestic situation becomes ever more precarious (husband injured at work, clashes with the in-laws, hard-hearted landlord). This is society as a slowly closing trap, with Loach accusatory towards the social workers and housing officers who are as cold as everyone else. The final scene, where Cathy’s children are taken off her in a railway station, is horrible in its raw intensity.In the late 90s and early 00s, Scotland provided a rich seam of material for Loach and this one – nominally a teen movie – is one of the finest. Starring Martin Compston (another first-timer who, unlike most of Loach’s discoveries, has gone on to enjoy a solid acting career), this is a rough, violent tale of Glasgow kid sucked, not entirely reluctantly, into the drug-dealing life. His naive dreams of escape soon evaporate: there is no going back.Kierston Wareing made a real splash in this excellent and well-observed drama (like The Navigators, a TV premiere in the UK but a cinema release in other countries). And also like that film, Loach finds a new seam of material in the outsourced working world, where job security and back-up have melted away. Wareing is a new version of the hemmed-in Loach figure: a recruitment agent ruthless to those below, a victim of those above, with none of the security net of old-style employment. Loach’s main target is the apparent freedom such conditions promise: the reality is very different.Loach was reportedly very disappointed by the box office failure of this Barry Hines adaptation, which motivated his return to TV in the ensuing decade. In retrospect, it is not hard to see why audiences avoided it: it is an incredibly gloomy black-and-white portrait of boredom and the Thatcherite recession. Looking at it now, it is an unexpectedly charming film: a study of a teenage relationship in adversity, staged with a total commitment to realism and awkwardness, and light years away from the John Hughes teen movies that would be coming down the pipe a few years later.A monster success – the Cannes Palme d’Or and record box office – that must have come as a pleasant surprise. All Loach’s characteristic ingredients are here: a fierce concentration on hot-button social issues (food banks and benefits assessment) preternaturally realistic performance a standup comic (Dave Johns) doing his first bit of acting. Released in the year of the Brexit referendum, and surfing on the Momentum-inspired confidence of the anti-austerity left, the film unexpectedly hit a major nerve. If we are being absolutely honest, as a film it is solid if not spectacular (although the awful baked-beans scene is up there with Loach’s most harrowing). In terms of impact, though, it is something else.Loach didn’t exactly discover Peter Mullan, who had been bobbing about for years – and had even played one of the builders in Riff-Raff (see below) – but he gave him a tremendous showcase in what turned out to be the finest of Loach’s Scotland-set films. Mullan plays the classic Loachian male: struggling with demons, hoping to be redeemed by love but dragged down by misplaced loyalties. It’s Mullan’s charisma that puts this one over the top, both ferocious and tender as the film requires it.Loach’s new film, his first since Blake, shows that he can pull off top-notch work as he heads into his 80s. As a subject, the gig economy appears to have only intensified the director’s motivations and his principal character here, delivery driver Ricky (Kris Hitchen), exemplifies the new type of trapped victim: worker solidarity has been destroyed by zero-hours contracts, with devastating effects on Ricky’s working and family life. It also contains one of Loach’s most memorable bad-guy characters: self-proclaimed “nasty bastard” Maloney, the warehouse supervisor played by Ross Brewster.Loach suddenly expanded his horizons in the mid-90s with this tribute to the foreign fighters who got involved in the Spanish civil war – another cause eternally dear to the left’s heart. Ian Hart – who had just played John Lennon in Backbeat – turned in a fine performance as the Liverpudlian communist who travels out to join the struggle in the 1930s like many a Loach protagonist before and since, supposed good guys (in this case, the Stalinist cadres of the International Brigades) are as bad as the official enemy. The script, by Jim Allen, posits the Trotskyist POUM militia as the real heroes. Rather brilliantly, Loach applied his ultra-realist style to the combat scenes, of house-to-house guerrilla warfare, with impressive results they effectively balance out the longwinded scenes of political discussion.After making a splash with his TV work, Loach was picked up by Joseph Janni, the celebrated producer of British new wave films such as Billy Liar, Darling and Far from the Madding Crowd. This was Loach’s feature debut, and it imported all the strengths of his previous films: empathetic drama, brilliantly natural performances (including one from Terence Stamp, amazingly right at the height of his 60s stardom), and an audacious deployment of on-camera improvisation. This very much benefited from being more focused and less digressive than the TV plays, and its refusal to find neat narrative solutions pointed the way ahead for Loach’s film work.Loach’s first Palme d’Or went to this complex, large-scale film about the Irish state’s birthing pains, ning both the war of independence against the British and the subsequent civil war that followed it. Like Land and Freedom, this suggested that authentic radical values were destroyed, cynically, by revolutionaries-in-name-only: Cillian Murphy, as a socialist doctor and IRA soldier, is the vessel through which this conflict is explored – first fighting alongside, and then against, his brother Teddy. It is a thoroughly absorbing film, and very much not the propaganda piece one might expect (although, inevitably, the British, fuelled by their imperial arrogance, don’t come out well).Loach has always liked to make films about camaraderie: the literal representation of the class solidarity so central to his political thinking, and something in desperately short supply in the era of outsourcing and privatisation. Riff-Raff is arguably his finest treatment of the theme: the group of builders working on (symbolism alert!) a former hospital being turned into luxury flats. The lead actor is Robert Carlyle, in a career-making performance as Stevie: Ricky Tomlinson (former real-world union activist and long-term resident of Brookside) was a revelation as the effervescent socialist and site leader. Loach also contrived one of his most moving romances, between Stevie and Emer McCourt’s Susan, undone by drugs and difficult circumstances. It is perhaps not Loach’s most hard-hitting film, but it is his most purely likable.It may have spent decades in school-treat screening hell, but Kes’s glories remain undimmed 50 years after it was first released. Adapted from Barry Hines’s novel about a kid who becomes obsessed with looking after a bird of prey, it has got an obvious point of entry for school-age children – it is the ultimate misfit story – so its popularity as a classroom time-filler is understandable.As a parable of how iniduality is squashed and warped – not only by the heartless teachers, but by Billy Casper’s uncaring family – it is as heartrending as ever. Loach got one of his most miraculously brilliant performances in the central role from David “Dai” Bradley the raft of others on hand include Brian Glover as the bullying sports teacher and Colin Welland as the friendlier English teacher.What sets the film apart, though, is that Kes is Loach’s most brilliant film cinematically: his and cinematographer Chris Menges’s interest in the Czech new wave found its expression in beautifully astute choices of shot and lighting, alternately amplifying the story’s wit, cruelty and desperation. It may seem churlish to pick Loach’s second feature as his best, but Kes has stood the test of time like no other, and will surely continue to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7daa489781fabe4c0013f424940b8be1552e697b/345_93_3146_1888/master/3146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=509d5016a1b52eecb13519e7c663b5e6","title":"of course marvel is cinema why the scorsese backlash is justified kevin smith taika waititi","story":"Kevin Smith, Taika Waititi and James Gunn reject veteran film-maker’s dismissal of superhero movies as ‘theme park’ fare – while his output exposes a debt to spectacle and innovationWho decides what qualifies as “real cinema”? Martin Scorsese, possessor of perhaps the most potent reputation (as cineaste and film-maker) in Hollywood, has apparently decided that it is him. After describing the Marvel movies as “theme parks” and “not cinema” in an interview with Empire published earlier this month, the celebrated director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas doubled down this week at the London film festival, where he is promoting his highly anticipated feature The Irishman.“What has to be protected is the singular experience of experiencing a picture, ideally with an audience,” Scorsese opined. “But there’s room for so many others now, and so many other ways. There’s going to be crossovers, completely. The value of a film that’s like a theme park film, for example, the Marvel-type pictures, where the theatres become amusement parks, that’s a different experience. I was saying earlier, it’s not cinema, it’s something else.”To say that Scorsese’s comments have inspired a furious backlash would be to ignore the reverence in which the Oscar-winner is held by many of those who find his recent comments unpalatable. So let us say merely that there plenty of film-makers out there, most of whom have worked on superhero movies at one time or another, that disagree with him fiercely.Kevin Smith reminded Scorsese that his own 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ resembles a superhero flick for those who are not religiously minded. Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, currently picking up Oscar buzz for his Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit, said simply: “Of course it’s cinema! It’s at the movies,” while s of the Galaxy’s James Gunn tweeted: “Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favourite living film-makers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I’m saddened that he’s now judging my films in the same way.”There are a million ways to unpick Scorsese’s argument. For a start, the film-maker’s attempts to label superhero films as corporate entities rather than examples of high art would appear to ignore almost every big-budget, special effects-laden film that has been made since Steven Spielberg’s Jaws and George Lucas’s Star Wars ushered in the blockbuster era in the mid 1970s. That is to wipe a lot of other people’s filmgoing experiences from the history books, purely on the basis of the director’s own view of film as “human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being”.A more cogent unravelling of Scorsese’s argument can be obtained by examining the film-maker’s own movies, as well as the history of film that the King of Comedy director cherishes so deeply. Let us take for an example 2011’s Hugo, the whimsical Scorsese fantasy set at a railway station in 1930s Paris. The movie is obsessed with the films of Georges Méliès, and particularly the French pioneer of early cinema’s classic space fantasy A Trip to the Moon.If there was ever a film to evoke a sense of childlike wonder in audiences – much like comic-book movies, some might say – it is this one. Astronauts travel to the moon, where they encounter a phantasmagorical lunar landscape of Carrollian mushrooms, cosmic rain showers and bizarre extraterrestrials. There is not much here in the way of narrative sophistication, frankly, and yet this was the film that Scorsese chose as the central pivot in one of his essential arguments within Hugo – that we need to preserve and celebrate both the history of film and the film-makers that helped make it.The director would no doubt point out that Méliès’s work comes from a different place, that it is inspired by magical inner reveries rather than the prospect of selling theme park tickets and toys. But it is hard not to see more than a hint of A Trip to the Moon in films such as Gunn’s own s of the Galaxy 2, in which our heroes head find themselves trapped among the psychedelic flora of Kurt Russell’s Ego the Living Planet.Moreover, technical innovation itself, as much as storytelling, is surely a valid element of cinema’s capacity to manifest as high art. Méliès hand-painted inidual cells to create some of the earliest colour cinematography, while his techniques were extensively copied by the earliest Hollywood film-makers, at a time when the fledgling US film industry was still lagging behind its European counterpart.Marvel, funnily enough, is known for pioneering the art of digital de-aging, in films such as Captain Marvel and Captain America: Civil War. Those same techniques are now being used by Scorsese himself to deliver younger versions of Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in The Irishman. Would such technologies have ever entered the conversation without the vast funds that the Disney-owned studio has to work with? That scenario seems as unlikely, sadly, as the prospect of Scorsese ever making a superhero film – though Todd Phillips’ Joker at least teasingly suggests what might have happened if he had ever taken a crack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92521ff78cb4f16ade8380d3f85f2d1dda4d1f2e/770_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22562a2f80a8504ee7ec7aa4a8fe93e0","title":"tell me who i am review amnesia documentary","story":"An amnesiac man and his twin brother come to terms with their troubled childhood in this involving but upsetting film This desperately upsetting Netflix documentary, a portrait of a troubled family, is best watched knowing as little possible. Director Ed Perkins slickly pieces his story together like a psychological thriller – a little too slickly, perhaps, for such an emotionally painful tale.Following a motorbike accident in 1982, 18-year-old Alex Lewis woke up from a coma with almost total memory loss. The only person he recognised was his twin brother, Marcus. Once he had left hospital, Marcus retaught Alex everything – how to tie his shoelaces, what a toaster does, the name of his girlfriend. And he told him the story of their childhood growing up with a loving mum and dad in a country pile in the home counties, the family holidays in France, the good life. But it was all a lie.The film is split into three parts. The first is an interview with amnesiac Alex. Looking back, he sees that Marcus’s story didn’t tally with the life he experienced when he came out of hospital. Marcus warned him their dad was a bully: “Always be polite. Call him sir.” Their mum was an odd eccentric. The brothers were made to sleep in a shed in the garden they weren’t allowed a key to the house. At 32, Alex learned the truth.In the second part, Perkins gives the perspective to Marcus – he still believes he did the right thing in protecting Alex from the horrors of his childhood memories.Now 54, these two scarred men sit across a table from each other in the film’s final section, their faces muted by pain and sadness. The film would be unbearable were it not for the fact that both have found some peace with happy families of their own. Perhaps their twinness, a feeling of never being alone, protected them. For the first time, Marcus tells Alex exactly what happened to them as boys. I am not sure we needed to hear the details, but Tell Me Who I Am is their film, so it’s their call.• Tell Me Who I Am is released in the UK on 18 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b4ca24a8ad97f332e3e09a6b015d7e74409079/0_139_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b51c2cedeb37527ccc0ca864b487e","title":"womens football have you tried to set up a grassroots team","story":"We want to hear from those who have struggled to set up women’s football teams Women’s football has seen a score of successes in recent months: England’s top league went professional, the World Cup was watched by record-breaking audiences and crowds during the current FA cup are growing.The number of girls and women taking up the sport has also skyrocketed, with 605 new girls youth teams and 260 new adult female clubs registered to play this season.But some women have experienced difficulties in accessing facilities, such as pitches.

Based on performances this season it is hard to see how this United team can hurt Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, but perhaps the worst thing about the failure they are experiencing is that I believe they have no choice but to just live with it, for now at least.By the end of his time in Manchester José Mourinho was making everybody miserable – his players, anyone forced to regularly watch them, and even himself. United were pretty much unbearable before he was sacked last December. But though the Portuguese is not widely associated with free-flowing football there is one thing he guarantees: trophies. In sacking him United effectively announced that some things – particularly a commitment to youth and attacking football – were more important to them than trophies.Ten months later they have a manager who puts his faith in youth and has certainly made the team less boring, but who doesn’t look at all likely to be parading silverware any time soon. In football, you always have to be careful what you wish for: you can’t abandon the single-minded pursuit of success only to change tack again a few months later because the alternative isn’t successful enough. Some might think that sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjær would help United to move forward, but it wouldn’t be real movement, just a series of kneejerk reactions.If United now regret their decision to appoint Solskjær, before they move to replace him they must examine why they went for him in the first place, find the faults in their methodology and try to deal with them. There is no point in leaping into another rash decision before they have corrected the issues that led to all the other rash decisions they took on their way to this point, and that led to them now considering another one.Mourinho is criticised for being a three-year manager, but that is probably about the right life for most coaches at top teams. Before any appointment is made those responsible have to know what they want the team to achieve over the following few years, and they must believe that their appointment is the right one to achieve those goals.When United first turned to Solskjær it was as a short-term fix who would be immediately welcomed by the fans, and he seemed to be a good choice for those limited ambitions. But even though he was initially successful, when they made his appointment permanent it was hard to see what they thought he could really be expected to achieve.When Liverpool appointed Klopp, on the other hand, his record and his personality made it reasonable to expect that he might win them a league title or a Champions League within a few years. What exactly did Solskjær promise? If he had delivered more than a few more months of overachievement they would have been very lucky – and often their player recruitment has been just as shortsighted.Researching a possible future career as a director of football in the last few months I have spoken to a variety of people who hold that position, and a lot of them say that one of the key things to building a team is being able to look three or four years in advance, both in player and managerial recruitment. It is their job to anticipate problems and have solutions prepared. What are the manager’s weaknesses and how can they be addressed? What issues are there with the make-up of the squad, and which players could be brought in to deal with them? Increasingly it looks like none of that analysis was done before United appointed Solskjær. They found themselves on a great run of form, didn’t have any better answers and took an easy nostalgic solution.And so here they are, approaching a home game against Liverpool, one of their great historic rivals, marooned in mid-table and seemingly with little hope of winning. Even through United’s post-Ferguson slump Liverpool have struggled at Old Trafford – they have only won once in the last decade, and even that was long enough ago that Luis Suárez was on the scoresheet. But at the moment this Liverpool side know only two ways of performing: either they play exceptionally well and blast teams away or they struggle but somehow grind out a win. Either way, they keep winning.When you compare the squads United don’t so much suffer from a lack of quality – there are some excellent players there, even if Liverpool have much greater depth – as a lack of leadership. Klopp has leaders in every line: Virgil van Dijk in defence, James Milner and Jordan Henderson in midfield, and an attack that offers consistency and quality. And, of course, the manager has the full confidence of the club. United somehow, as a team, seem to lack character.Liverpool look certain to challenge for trophies again, but before the Champions League triumph in June they had won a single League Cup in 13 years, and it is 30 years since they last won the league. They have had to wait a long time for this, but that’s football. United are still coming to terms with the departure of literally the greatest manager of all time, and though they might find a solution sooner perhaps it will take another 15 or 20 years before they are English champions again. It will not cheer them up much but for the neutral there is beauty in the long-term unpredictability of football, in the cycles of success and failure.Just like Liverpool, United will never get used to not winning, and their history will continue to fuel their ambition. But nostalgia is not always healthy, and if you spend too long looking to the past you risk losing control of your future. All that matters for United now is the present, the young manager in their dugout trying to rebuild, and the task of working out – better late than never – what needs to happen next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0538b5e0f902e3e53e896c68b7af2723b7498a86/376_168_2029_1218/master/2029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab310afa627b4da1de6b91496e8d515","title":"ralf rangnick interview sporting director manchester united","story":"The German sporting director talks about his philosophy – ‘like a jigsaw with 500 pieces’ – his time at Sussex University and what has gone wrong at Manchester UnitedIn the end Ralf Rangnick did not get the England job in 2016 – he was, he says, down to the last two, alongside Sam Allardyce – but you can still see his influence on the English game. Jürgen Klopp uses tactics grounded in Rangnick’s fast transitions and his Liverpool team have four players who owe their big break in Europe to Rangnick: Joël Matip (at Schalke), Roberto Firmino (Hoffenheim), Naby Keïta and Sadio Mané (RB Salzburg).Rangnick is a byword for tactical influence and talent development in Germany, even taking some credit for the national team’s 2014 World Cup success. This season’s Bundesliga has been nicknamed the “Rangnickliga”, as five teams in the top six positions have head coaches who learned their craft under him.The personable German, 61, has embraced a new role as head of sport and development at Red Bull, looking after teams in New York and São Paulo, where the newly purchased Bragantino are on the verge of promotion to the Brazilian top-flight.It is a change from last year, when he combined the jobs of sporting director and head coach at RB Leipzig, keeping the coach’s seat warm for Julian Nagelsmann, who arrived from Hoffenheim in the summer. Leipzig finished third and reached the German Cup final. “This only worked because all the players we had in the squad were those I had already signed as sporting director, so we had an existing relationship,” Rangnick tells the . “It would have been impossible to do both in the long term.”The pillars of his sporting director role encompass everything on the football side: the first team, academy, medical set-up and recruitment. “We see it like a jigsaw with 500 pieces, and our role is to ensure that we have each piece available to help every player improve. We help every inidual in the whole club develop and flourish.”Rangnick looks back with pride at his work with Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, whom he left in 2015. Leipzig were in the fourth ision when he joined and are now realistic Bundesliga title contenders. Salzburg are breaking scoring records in Austria (46 goals in 10 games) and had a stunning start to their Champions League campaign, beating Genk 6-2 and losing 4-3 at Liverpool.“We can see where they are now and say we took the correct decisions at the time that gives us a good feeling.” Both clubs have spent money but Rangnick makes the point that they are not the only ones. Salzburg have made a profit of more than €200m in player sales in the past five years.Rangnick fell in love with English football as a 21-year-old student on a year abroad at Sussex University, as part of his English and PE degree from Stuttgart University. He remembers going to the Goldstone Ground and watching Brighton lose 4-1 to Liverpool. “I remember the Brighton fans singing: ‘Seagulls! Seagulls!’ despite the scoreline. And the Liverpool fans responded: ‘Seaweed! Seaweed!’ Scouse humour, huh?”He famously played for the local non-league side Southwick FC, 11 games that moulded him as a coach: “The most important thing for me was the amount of coaching we did on the pitch,” he says. “We always spurred each other on, coaching among ourselves or motivating each other. That was inspirational for me.”Now Rangnick is the inspiration, a poster boy for a sporting director model that is increasingly popular in the Premier League – with one obvious exception. Manchester United let it be known they wanted a director of football more than a year ago but no appointment has followed.So would Rangnick, a sporting director with a proven track record, be interested in an approach from Old Trafford? “I am happy where I am but if any club wanted to speak to me, the question would have to be: ‘Can I be somebody who can influence areas of development across the whole club?’ Otherwise you are only getting half of what I am capable of. If, after that, you can work together in a trustworthy and respectful way, then you are more likely to be successful.”Rangnick understands the reluctance of some clubs to change a traditional set-up. “It’s always difficult to follow someone like Sir Alex Ferguson, who was so successful and in place for a long time – and that’s even harder if you are often changing coaches,” he says. “With every coaching change, the identity changes and this is reflected in the sporting development. You can look at the money that team has had available in the last five years and say there has been an underperformance.”It is no coincidence, he adds, that the two teams currently dominating the Premier League have a clear playing style. “They have their identity and know what they need to develop, and so it’s no coincidence that they are dominating the league.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09535a5849a60941ed8512a0e412e52b1cdd368/264_83_1175_705/master/1175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f028253c65572ccb0bb9534930bfb7d2","title":"buy a classic david squires cartoon from our collection","story":"Our cartoonist looks back at 25 of his favourite strips from down the years, all of which are now available at our  Print Shop, a link to each can be found by clicking on the title of each caption below"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026794cc01ff3f0d91a562d23c4b7ac36e8a3507/0_300_7323_4397/master/7323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aab07d67747d625968d9cd9a9b1788b9","title":"jelly jell o gelatin internet trend","story":"From fashion to the art world – down to the simple charms of a video of Jell-O being ked – gelatin is having a momentFor a year now, I’ve been a member of a Facebook group for … gelatin enthusiasts.Called, amazingly, Show Me Your Aspics (get it?), it’s a haven for about 30,000 fans of fluctuant foodstuffs, often referred to by the brand name “Jell-O” in the US and “jelly” in the UK. Members share photography from retro cookbooks (like this picture of a mutilated sea bass reconstructed with a conga line of gelatin-ensconced shrimp on its back) or jiggle videos of various jellies being ked with spoons (those are my favorite).Some of it is appetizing, much of it is emphatically not, but all of it qualifies as “oddly satisfying”, a category of web content that emerged from Reddit in 2013 and encapsulates a variety of quotidian-yet-hypnotic stuff – like watching people cut soap or squeeze slime.The question of why some people find wobbly Jell-O so appealing is subjective. According to a Facebook post by my fellow group member, University of the Pacific food historian Ken Albala, gelatin’s allure lies in:“The irresistible jiggle, threatening collapse with every twist and turn. The thrill of the spoon smoothly cleaving its slick glossy flesh. Then in the mouth, that bounce, the subtle firmness that first resists then gently yields to the pressure of the teeth.”But that’s just one guy’s opinion. For the rest of us, wiggle videos may provide anxiety-reducing ASMR. Philosopher Evan Malone has even made a case for the phenomenon of “odd satisfaction” being a product of the grace of witnessing a “perfect fit”.What is clear is that jelly’s charms are catching on: lately, the worlds of fashion and art have also been ready for some jelly.To wit: for SS20, Balenciaga showed three gowns, domed like gelatin molds and bouncing with their wearer’s every step. At Alexander McQueen, Kaia Gerber, her face gleaming with highlighter, wore a petal-like confection evocative of the flowers fluted into 3D jelly cakes (artistic desserts popular in Mexico and Vietnam). At Issey Miyake, dresses horizontally striped with juicy colors descended from the ceiling, pouring over models who jiggled joyfully inside them.Then there is the contemporary Irish designer Sinéad O’Dwyer, who molds silicone directly on her models, creating vividly colored garments flaunting the suggestive visual metaphor between jelly and flesh.Gelatin is also relevant to the art world, where its moldability makes it a useful medium for experimentation.Since 2007, culinary artists Bompas \u0026amp Parr have been crafting jelly architecture, like a zesty orange version of Buckingham Palace. Their work also inspired photographer Jenny van Sommers to create her mesmerizing The Jelly Film, in which four jellies express their personalities through dance (just watch it).More recently, as observed in the New York Times Magazine, queer and female artists have drawn upon gelatin’s fleshy sensuality, camp appeal and associations with feminine domesticity to inform their work.Artist Alison Kuo (another Show Me Your Aspics member) engaged “notions of sacrifice” by manhandling Jell-O in a live performance piece in Manhattan early this year. Artist duo Lazy Mom and photographer Joseph Maida both use gelatin in their jolie laide subversions of Instagram aesthetics. Sharona Franklin, a disabled artist whose sculptures recall her reliance on transgenic medicine, creates found object-filled jellies so eccentrically chic that this week, fashion copycat watchdog Diet Prada posted allegations that Gucci plagiarized her.Yet what if you cannot reconcile jelly’s growing appeal with its slaughterhouse origins, and are distressed that the worldwide gelatin industry itself is on the rise – estimated to be worth $4bn by 2024?In that case, consider casting your lot in not with art but science. Synthetic biology startup Geltor aims to have the first lab-grown vegan gelatin to market in 2020.In search of the optimal wobble, the company used genetically engineered mastodon collagen in its early prototypes.With growing interest in next-gen gelatins, the appeal of jelly is undoubtedly spreading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d89c813134ddb5ff676c6b6839c0312ccceba06/0_1040_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd351586eefc3862c331f5734c239042","title":"what happens when you try all the cbd products you can find","story":"Would the alleged magic of cannabidiol have an effect on me or is it all snake oils and placebos?Shortly before I sat down to begin writing this, I squirted a 1 milliliter dropper of full-spectrum hemp extract, also known as CBD oil, under my tongue. It contained – according to the bottle – 6.25 mg of CBD per dosage, and tasted – also per the bottle’s label – of cold-pressed oranges.I wasn’t sure what to expect, if anything. But with the mania around CBD approaching fever pitch, I was curious to know if I, too, could in some way be touched by its allegedly remarkable powers of stress reduction, relaxation, and all-around wellbeing. We live in dire times. What’s the harm in trying to get away from it all without actually having to go anywhere?I bought the oil a week ago at the 420 Store, which bills itself as “New York’s first luxury, dedicated CBD store”. Most of its wares are displayed sparingly on pristine white shelves, and run the gamut from bath salts and skin creams to flavored gummies and tinctures. All contain some amount of CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound (different from THC, the plant’s main psychoactive compound).The shop has a self-serious, high-gloss ambience, with a touch of wellness-derived spirituality thrown in, like some hybrid of Sephora and a Burning Man prayer circle. It made me want to laugh, but also made me mad, which is the same reaction I have to most attempts of the wellness industry to commodify and market the myriad stresses that accompany our attempts to exist in the modern world.The 420 Store opened its doors in June, six months after hemp was removed from the FDA’s list of controlled substances. Although there were already plenty of CBD products on the market, this had the effect of ungating a dam suddenly CBD seemed to be everywhere, from bodega counters to subway ads to shiny Soho storefronts to Walgreens. CBD had effectively become the new pumpkin spice, sprinkled on products high and low and everywhere in-between in an attempt to cash in on its alleged magic.CBD is purported to provide relief from a host of bodily ills like inflammation, pain and digestive problems to stress and anxiety. As such, the market is now crowded with CBD-infused chocolate bars, beverages, gummies, body lotions, pills, tinctures, face masks, and pain creams. The products are not limited to humans: a reportedly growing number of pet parents now turn to cannabidiol as the latest remedy to treat their pups.Dr Jordan Tishler founded and has run the Boston-based medical cannabis practice InhaleMD for six years (which in the cannabis world, makes him “one of the old guys”, he said). He’s also an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He takes a slightly dim view on the CBD gold rush. “I’m like, this is a side step this is foolishness,” he said. “People are so obsessed with talking about CBD that they’ve stopped talking about cannabis. And at the end of the day, cannabis is what helps my patients. CBD is close to useless.”Topicals, Tishler explained, wouldn’t do anything to me (“They’re another mythology– cannabinoids don’t go through your skin,” he said). Ingestible products such as vapes and oils might have an impact, but have been known to contain heavy metals like arsenic and mercury. The FDA doesn’t regulate cannabis products, and many of them aren’t subjected to third-party laboratory testing. Tishler recommended buying products only from legitimate dispensaries that require a medical marijuana card, which I didn’t have, so I went for the OTC variety.I started with the topicals: TriBeauty’s CBD Superfood Mask, Tribe Revive’s CBD-infused pain cream, TriBeauty’s CBD eye cream, and Uncle Bud’s CBD body lotion. All of them smelled nice the pain cream had a pleasant wintergreen aroma, while the face mask was redolent of pineapple (it doesn’t actually include pineapple, though it does include kale, spinach, and green tea). And all of them were, well, creamy I appreciated their ease of application and lack of discernible oiliness.Did any of them make me feel anything? No. Of course they didn’t the only thing I felt was the menthol in the Tribe Revive pain cream, which made my arm tingle like I’d slathered on Bengay. The amount I was getting from the creams was miniscule, in the ballpark of 1 to 5 mg. The doses that tend to be effective in humans, says Tishler, are 10 to 20 mg per kilogram. “The average human is about 70 kg,” he says. “That’s 700 to 1400 mg of CBD per day. Nobody can get that.”Annoyed but not surprised, I pressed on to ingestibles. I bought the Vitamin Shoppe’s Ancient Nutrition’s organic CBD hemp caplets (10 mg) and Winged’s Happiness “mood support complex”, (15 mg of CBD per soft gel, “uniquely formulated for women”). From the 420 Store, I bought Wyld’s blackberry gummies (25 mg per gummy) Grön’s Fair Trade dark chocolate bar (100 mg per $23.99 bar – yes, you read the price correctly) and Toast’s cold-pressed orange tincture (250 mg of CBD per one-ounce bottle) – the one I took before I started writing this. From TribeTokes, I tried Tribe Tincs’ full-spectrum CBD tincture (1,500 mg of CBD per one-ounce bottle).Had I taken them all at once, I would have easily exceeded the 700 mg mark, but the thought of potentially incapacitating myself with CBD was not appealing. I had a job and shit to do. So I proceeded with some vague sense of moderation.Unlike the lack of effectiveness of the topicals, the ingestibles presented a spectrum of results. On one end were capsules by Winged. One capsule’s evening primrose oil and “good mood complex”, it read, “may support balanced hormone levels as well as the brain’s ‘happy’ neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. Get your smile on girl!” Instead, I felt nothing (aside from disgust for the company’s car salesman-esque messaging) .Toast’s tincture did taste and smell just like oranges, as advertised, but was similarly uneventful. As for the Grön bar, it tasted like any other decent artisan chocolate bar, but the idea of eating the whole thing just to glean some kind of purported CBD effect was unappetizing. So I gave up, unaltered.Trying to toe the line between Tishler’s recommended effective dosage, my need to be a functioning adult, and, at this point, determined to feel … something, I took the Tribe Tinc’s prescribed 50 mg dosage. While I disagree with its claim of flavorlessness – to me, it carried a definite note of weedy funk – it did produce a noticeable feeling of general wellbeing, a sense that life had somehow become something I didn’t need to worry about very much.I felt my mind stray from thoughts of deadlines, rising sea levels, and the president’s sphincter-like visage to how beautiful my bag of frozen compost looked when I removed it from the freezer. Whether this was because I took it on the weekend or wasn’t feeling particularly anxious to begin with, I don’t know there’s also the possibility of the (very real) placebo effect. But what I can say is that, for whatever reason, 50 mg of CBD seemed to have a positive effect on me, insofar as it seemed to redirect my mind to a more sunny locale.Likewise, taking one of Wyld’s 25 mg gummies seemed to alter my outlook on the day. It helped that the gummies actually taste like blackberries and are thus delicious they also have a pleasing soft-chewy texture. Not long after taking one, I started to feel somewhat relaxed – so relaxed that I literally walked into traffic later that afternoon (thankfully, it was moving slowly, as was I).For my last adventure in CBD, I decided to go big, and also straight to the source. On a sunny Thursday afternoon, I climbed a flight of stairs to the snug but brightly lit Lower Manhattan office of Tribe Tokes. There I was greeted by Kim Byrnes, the company’s cofounder, who proceeded to guide me through a CBD dab. Byrnes, clad in midriff-bearing athleisure wear (she’s also a longtime pilates instructor) is an incredibly enthusiastic proponent of both CBD and THC – both, she told me, have helped her treat her ulcerative colitis and other ailments. She sounded almost encyclopedic as she talked about the numerous methods of CBD ingestion and their comparative merits.A dab is a highly concentrated form of CBD, containing about 10-15 mg of CBD. You inhale its vapor through a dab rig, a close cousin to the bong. The result, Byrnes said, is a “body high – it feels nice and relaxed and calm”.She put a concentrate of 7 Point Natural’s CBD Terp Sauce, a mix of CBD crystals and cannabis terpenes (organic compounds) in the rig’s nail and heated it up. I sucked the resulting vapor deep into my lungs, and, because I’m a rank amateur, scorched my esophagus. But on my second pull, I managed to get light-headed for a minute, and then felt … fine.It was only after leaving the TribeTokes office that I began to understand what Byrnes was talking about. All of the afternoon’s obstacles seemed to fall away from me, leaving me to walk a clear, gloriously smooth path through the rest of my day. Tourists walking four abreast down the sidewalk? Whatever, I thought. They’re just enjoying my city’s unparalleled beauty. A 15-minute wait for the train home? Not a problem, I thought more time to watch adorable rats frolic on the tracks.I felt beatific rather than annoyed by all of the obstacles the city placed in my path. But more than anything, I felt lucky. I am lucky that I’m at a point in my life where I’m not suffering from aches and pains or even much anxiety, aside from the usual geopolitical-climate-crisis-end-of-days variety. Had I written this story a few months ago, when I was dealing with the aftermath of a terrible relationship and wrenching shoulder and back pain, I might have been much more receptive to the claims being made by the CBD industry. But on this day, I was a contented skeptic.My head felt clear, my limbs felt loose, and the world rolled out its carpet in front of me, beckoning me to bask in the sunshine of my mind’s own invention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439f901892d115f82c0062fc89f876742715d61c/5_70_2484_1490/master/2484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf21db453e689800ded24744c3a6e896","title":"nicky morgan open minded about bbc licence fee future","story":"Culture secretary said she would consider it during appearance before select committeeNicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has said she is “open-minded” about scrapping the BBC television licence fee and replacing it with a Netflix-style subscription service.The cabinet minister said she would consider it as an option during a select committee hearing in comments that will delight Tory critics of the broadcaster.She raised the possibility in answer to a question from Julian Knight, the Conservative MP for Solihull, who asked her to consider scrapping the licence fee and suggested a subscription service as a possible policy for the party’s election manifesto.“I’m open minded and I will have decisions and listen to evidence on all sides,” she said, speaking to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.“What I haven’t seen is any evidence, either way, what a subscription-based system would do in terms of the revenue.“The licence fee last year raised £3.7bn for the BBC. They obviously have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.”Sources in her department later suggested that it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out that the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027 for the duration of the 11-year charter period.However, her comments will boost the hopes of some Tory MPs who dislike the BBC and have long been campaigning for an end to the universal £154.50-a-year licence fee. A subscription service like Netflix would mean people having to opt in to watch programmes on BBC channels and listen to its radio stations.The idea was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank, which was welcomed by Knight, who predicted: “Personally, I think the next licence fee will be the last.”In the same hearing, Morgan said she would not intervene in the BBC’s decision to abolish free TV licences for over-75s.She said she had “no plans” to review the BBC’s television licence shake-up, after the broadcaster agreed in 2015 to fund the free licences given to those aged over 75.The BBC announced this year that only low-income households in receipt of pension credits would receive the benefit, meaning around 3.7 million elderly people will have to pay £154.50 a year in future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbdbd6a7bca0a3d1deff7ef88e4583041533a4c7/247_296_5796_3477/master/5796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f388caac0eca6dba5df7af804c2e01bf","title":"ford urgent safety recall parts repair","story":"When it didn’t have the parts, it suggested the car could be driven despite needing ‘urgent action’I received a letter from the Ford Motor Company advising of a safety recall on my vehicle. It told me “urgent action” was required on the engine coolant sensor system. I immediately booked my car into the local dealer and was told that the work might take up to two days. But I was subsequently informed that Ford was unable to supply the parts to fix it. After four days without my car, there is no date in sight as to when it will be fixed. It is clear that Ford has not prepared the necessary parts for the emergency recall. I am going on holiday in a week and had already booked my car for the Dart crossing and the car park at Stansted airport before learning of the recall. I now do not have a car to get me there. You finally ended up spending 10 days without your car or a courtesy vehicle while parts were shipped in from Germany.Ford’s suggestion to me that you could take your car to the airport provided you top up the coolant level was not reassuring, given the urgency of the recall notice and the implications if the coolant pipes failed.In the US last year Ford undertook to pay for replacement engines after leaking coolant pipes caused overheating damage.Ford says that the recall letters had been sent in waves throughout 2018 and 2019 to ensure sufficient parts were available, potentially leaving drivers at risk of engine failure for up to 12 months.You were finally reunited with your car the day before your holiday and, as you drove it home a warning light signalled an engine malfunction.When you took it back to the dealer it was found that, after replacing the pipes, mechanics had forgotten to top up the coolant! The dealer eventually offered £200 in goodwill.In a way you were lucky. This month the BBC Watchdog programme discovered that 3.4 million cars that had been issued with a safety recall were still awaiting repairs, and that UK drivers are not alerted to some urgent problems that prompt a recall overseas.The UK car recall system relies on manufacturers reporting issues, but there are no standard rules on how serious the problem has to be before it triggers a recall.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Depending on your favourite story about her, Ethel Smyth is the brick-throwing suffragette conducting her fellow Holloway inmates with a toothbrush, or the bisexual society lady sketched by John Singer Sargent, or the rebellious young woman who defied her father to study composition at the Leipzig Conservatory but who dropped out because she didn’t think the teaching was up to much. Her Mass in D, premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in 1893 but almost absent from the choral society conveyor belt since, is as grand in scope as one might expect from such a woman. It’s gratifying to find it getting the kind of recording it deserves from forces who can do justice to its ambition.Smyth later said that writing the mass “sweated out” any thoughts she was harbouring of converting to Catholicism, and the atmosphere is operatic rather than devout – and so on this disc the stirring, seaswept overture to The Wreckers, her best-known opera, makes for an excellent prelude. In the mass itself, Oramo follows Smyth’s request to place the exuberant Gloria at the end, so it sounds structured for the concert hall rather than the cathedral. The opening Kyrie sets a scene full of tension, with music serious enough to be asking mercy for any amount of sin but there’s a hint of consolation towards the end of the movement, and the Credo bursts on in an eruption of joy – the most striking of several dramatic plays of light and shade. The four vocal soloists are a little far back in the mix, and there are fleeting moments when one wants more fullness of tone from the two men, but the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus are on excellent, sumptuous form, and this recording should win the mass many new fans.There are more discoveries to be had, on a smaller scale, in Her Voice, the Neave Trio’s album of distinctive and distinguished chamber works by Louise Farrenc, Amy Beach and Rebecca Clarke. But for sheer enjoyment, try the folk-classical group Kottos’s new release Songs \u0026amp Dances, in which they take pieces by composers including Bartók, Vaughan Williams and Vivaldi and reimagine them for a quartet of accordion, bouzouki, recorder and lyrical cello.

At full pelt, the insects travelled 108 times their body length per second, the researchers found.“They fly through the air with no feet on the ground from stride to stride,” even at relatively slow speeds, said Sarah Pfeffer, who studies animal behaviour at Ulm University in Germany.There is a reason Saharan silver ants, or Cataglyphis bombycina, have evolved to be fleet of foot. Unlike other desert creatures which shelter from the intense noon heat, for the ants it is a prime time to scavenge. When the desert is at its hottest, they emerge from their nests and zip about looking for food – often the carcasses of less fortunate creatures that have succumbed to the brutal temperatures.To survive, the ants have silvery hairs that reflect the sun’s rays. But even with this coating and other adaptations, the ants can barely survive the 60C (140F) heat and need impressive speed and navigational skills to find food and return to the nest before falling victim to the heat themselves.Before Pfeffer and her colleagues could clock the ants racing around the desert, they first had to find them. The scientists travelled to Douz, a town in southern Tunisia, and scoured the nearby dunes for the streaks of silver that are the ants in motion.Having traced some ants back to their nest, the researchers laid an aluminium channel along the ground and placed mealworms or shortbread crumbs at the far end. Above the track they attached a downwards-facing high-speed video camera to record the ants as they tore back and forth.Once slowed down, the footage shows the ants coordinating their movements with incredible precision, moving three legs – which work together as a tripod – at a time. Running flat out, the ants covered 85.5cm per second in 47 strides, more than 10 times Usain Bolt’s stride rate. Between each stride, each ant foot touched the ground for as little as seven milliseconds.Similar footage of another fast desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis, which is found in the Tunisian salt pans, recorded the insects hitting a top speed of 62cm per second. Details are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.While the Saharan silver ants have shorter legs than their salt pan cousins, the furious stride rate more than compensates, the scientists found. Beyond teasing out the biomechanical secrets of the ants’ incredible speed, the research reveals tricks that engineers can exploit to build smaller, faster, scampering robots, Pfeffer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee1fe445eb27ff43a0ca3c8e720a86bf3d9e3120/274_244_5657_3395/master/5657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4530b73a5d4dedb23a7bf1a3dba6851c","title":"champion jockey oisin murphy frankie dettori","story":"“It will be quite a moment,” Oisin Murphy says as he looks forward to this Saturday afternoon at Ascot when he will be crowned champion jockey. The 24-year-old from Killarney is eloquent and assured and, apart from being able to speak four languages, carries the same addiction to winning as all the great champions.Murphy has also overcome resentment in the weighing room and taken punches from older jockeys who did not like the speed of his rise after he left Ireland for England six years ago. He is now a model champion and could become the jockey whom racing will rely on most to fill the giant hole that Frankie Dettori will leave when, eventually, the little master retires.“I grew up watching Kieren Fallon being champion jockey,” Murphy continues. “And in the last few years I’ve looked up to champions like Silvestre de Sousa and Jim Crowley. I’ve got huge admiration for them and wanted to become champion. Now I’ve done it I want to do it again. Money doesn’t motivate me in any way. I just want to win many championships.”Murphy smiles on a crisp and sunlit morning in Newmarket as he compares himself to racing’s most famous champion who will turn 49 in December. “I’ve won 13 Group Ones. Frankie Dettori has won well over 200 Group Ones. I think he’s ridden 17 this year. That’s phenomenal. I’ll never get to his level. At 24, Frankie was streets above where I am now.”Dettori steadied Murphy during the young Irishman’s slump this summer – soon after he got into trouble after failing a breath test in June. “May was going supremely well.” Murphy remembers. “I had a really good week and I was excited about Royal Ascot. I had more rides there than everybody except Frankie and Ryan Moore. I thought I had some genuine chances. Then came a massive reality check.”On 16 June, Murphy’s breath test reading was well under the drink-driving limit but he still exceeded the accepted limit for drinking as a jockey and Murphy does not attempt to excuse himself.“It was my fault,” he says of a misdemeanour that cost him a day’s racing at Salisbury. “If you’re dehydrated the day before and you consume alcohol, don’t go to bed on time, don’t hydrate the next day and don’t eat anything, you’re in trouble.”Did the failed test affect his racing? “Yes. It was going round in my mind that I missed three winners that Sunday. You’re thinking: ‘If I lose the championship by three winners then it’s my fault.’ All the trainers I ride for texted me and I obviously rang Sheikh Fahad as I’m the retained jockey for Qatar Racing. Everyone was really supportive. But it was so embarrassing. Even now I’m ashamed of it.”He allowed that season low to knock him off kilter. “I went from about 12 in front to about 12 behind. I was getting on favourites but my instinct and feel had gone and they weren’t winning. So you get in that rut and you overthink it. But there was a turning point. In late July things started to pick up. Frankie won the Irish Oaks on Star Catcher. I texted him after the race and he said: ‘Thanks kiddo. Remember I want you to be champion jockey. Forget about the numbers at the moment. Start riding off instinct. I believe in you.’ So the next fortnight I did not look at the championship table. I had the strength not to do it. I was one or two in front and then I got four winners. I had that belief back.”After 166 victories so far this season Murphy is 33 clear of the runner-up, Danny Tudhope, and 69 ahead of Crowley in third place. It feels as if it is the start of a new championship reign – as well as the culmination of a long journey. When he was a boy Murphy wanted to become a champion show-jumper and, as many of the best riders in that sport were based in Germany, he worked hard and learned German. But his life changed when he finally sat on a racehorse for the first time at the age of 14.His uncle, Jim Culloty, had won the Grand National and the Gold Cup, and he was merciless in dissecting Murphy’s technique. “In Ireland we have pony and horse races – it depends on the course. We call them flappers and normally the big races are over two miles. They’re actual racehorses, ridden by children, so you develop fantastic horsemanship skills but also lots of bad habits. Like interference-wise. It becomes competitive. The falls can be bad and the tracks are tight. I had a couple of concussions. Most Irish boys will start riding racehorses aged 10. I was 14. It didn’t come naturally. I remember watching the video replays with my uncle and he made me cry because I was really bad.”Murphy points out that Fallon was much older than him when he first got on a horse. Fallon became a six-time champion jockey and, after Murphy began racing seriously in England in 2013, the veteran often put his fellow Irishman in his place. “Oh yeah,” Murphy says amid much laughter. “Numerous times. It’s a bit different now and interference rules are stricter. When I started, if a senior jockey wanted your position, he just took it.Did Murphy attempt to fight his corner? “It really used to depend on my mood and how confident I was on the day. If I had a chance, normally I could keep them off.”Would someone as feisty as, say Fallon, take it out on Murphy afterwards? “Oh no. He’s actually very good to me. Often he would encourage you. He’s a good person.”I like Fallon too but I have heard he once knocked Murphy down in the weighing room. “No,” Murphy stresses. “Kieren Fallon never punched me. He never laid a finger on me. Other jockeys did. They would get physical.”Murphy is almost amused about the fact he took a few punches from older jockeys. “I was probably a little cheeky. I suppose I still am – but nobody would punch me now. If a young lad rides badly in a race, it’s my job to discipline him. But you achieve a lot more saying something quietly, and explaining what was wrong, than losing the plot.”When he was hit by older jockeys did it increase his determination? “Of course. That’s what happens when you’re trying to prove yourself. I was handed loads of opportunities. Lads see that and there’s envy. It was easy to take because I was just riding winners all the time. But a jockey’s confidence is tempered on a daily basis. No matter how good you are, you’re going to suffer from that all the time. It’s a constant battle, believing in yourself. No jockey is that cocky, actually.”Murphy rejects the claim the weighing room is much more cut-throat on the Flat than in the less lucrative world of jump racing. “I can’t have that. You wouldn’t find a closer-knit weighing room than ours at the moment. James Doyle, Harry Bentley, Andrea Atzeni, Luke Morris, Silvestre de Sousa and I hang out very often. I get on with all the apprentices. I’m not in the jump jockey’s weighing room but they all work in the same yards and try to steal each other’s rides. As Flat jockeys we all have our own jobs.”Is Dettori the best jockey Murphy has ever raced against? “Yip. Ryan Moore’s very good but I love the way Frankie rides. He doesn’t get into traffic because his hands are so good. He can light them up from the gate and then get his hands on their neck. You often don’t appreciate that because you just see him do it automatically. But swap jockeys and those horses couldn’t be ridden as aggressively. He’s different class.”Unlike Dettori, who focuses on the big races, Murphy still wants to win multiple championships while also racking up Group One victories. Is it possible to maintain this relentless strategy for the next few years? “It is. I want to stay as champion jockey and I think I can do it. I got my licence in May 2013 and haven’t been on a holiday since. I don’t feel it because most of my horses are winning. So it’s good.”As much as Murphy is relishing Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, he suddenly winces. “I had a look at the racing in Chelmsford this evening. I could have ridden two or three of the top favourites. So that’s thrown me now. I could go and jock some young riders off those horses but I’m not doing that. So I’m waiting for Ascot.”How will he feel when he walks down the tunnel of applauding jockeys to collect his trophy? “A bit weird. It will feel good for five minutes and then I will have to try get another winner. The buzz is almost over now. It’ll be nice to lift the trophy but I’m already thinking of doing it again next year.”Oisin Murphy will be crowned champion jockey on QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday 19 October.

Moeen Ali, who is on an agreed break from Test consideration, is also rested for the white-ball leg of the tour.Patel, due to meet the England squad in Christchurch next week, is keen to pursue coaching after he calls time on his playing career and has been granted special dispensation from New Zealand and Wellington to miss the first three matches of the Plunket Shield campaign.The deal is the second to follow Silverwood’s appointment England’s new head coach last week, with Paul Collingwood having also signed permanently as an assistant coach after previously working on a series-by-series basis.Silverwood and Giles have now switched attention to the vacancy left by the former’s promotion an interim fast‑bowling coach is being sought for the New Zealand tour before the pair consider candidates for the full-time position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e1548aa56ae1103313243ddf31dc31227397e9/528_240_4227_2536/master/4227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df3d6c7e9a180a76eaefb91f1038626","title":"rubgy world cup new zealand ireland teams","story":"Green will be New Zealand’s colour on Saturday. They go into their quarter-final against an Ireland team that has won two of the past three Tests between the sides with a recently minted back ision while their opponents will be armed with 12 of the starting lineup in last November’s victory over the All Blacks in Dublin.Given that the scrum-half Conor Murray and the centre Robbie Henshaw missed that match because of injury and Iain Henderson has established himself in the second row at Devin Toner’s expense, Ireland are virtually at full strength. Bundee Aki may have been picked ahead of Garry Ringrose in the midfield but for his suspension for a high tackle against Samoa, but their head coach, Joe Schmidt, has gone for experience and players who know what success tastes like.Like Schmidt, the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, is preparing for what may be his last Test with both men standing down at the end of their side’s tournament, whenever that may be. He talked during his team announcement about not living in the past when asked about Ireland’s victories in 2016 and last year, their only two against the All Blacks in 114 years of trying, but his body language suggested his memory stretched some way beyond the start of this tournament.The forecast here is for rain on Saturday, but Hansen has picked a team to attack Ireland out wide. The wings George Bridge and Steve Reece have 12 caps between them, the centre Jack Goodhue 11 and Richie Mo’unga, who continues at outside-half with Beauden Barrett the second playmaker at full-back, 14. The experienced Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty did not even make the bench, which is where Sonny Bill Williams will sit.Ireland’s victory last November was based on their suffocating defence which prevented New Zealand from playing with width together with their ability to retain possession. Seldom in recent years have the World Cup holders looked so clueless and, although they did not know until last weekend who they would be playing in the quarter-finals, they will have been planning for this match for a long time, ready to cold-bloodedly serve their revenge.Despite being the bookmakers’ favourites, New Zealand are not widely fancied here to win the cup for a third successive team. The Irish media at Schmidt’s team announcement here at Disneyworld were fantasising about a first appearance in a semi-final at the ninth time of trying, optimism breaking through after the cloudburst prompted by the defeat to Japan.Ireland have only conceded two tries this tournament and when Hansen was asked to sum up Ireland’s strength he said: “They are tenacious. They play a pretty structured game and they know what they are good at. They do not wander too much off script and they are not a team that give you many opportunities through mistakes.”Schmidt has in the past cited the ability of the All Blacks to turn defence into attack with alacrity, highlighting the essential difference between the sides. New Zealand are reactive, waiting to exploit a disorganised defence, while Ireland have the organisation of a side that prepares in the minutest detail. Both sides are coached by New Zealanders, but their approaches are markedly different.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter“You cannot go out against New Zealand and accept that you are second fiddle,” said Schmidt. “You need belief and the accumulation of experience and success our players have had builds confidence. After beating them twice in three years, we know we are not going to be able to sneak up and surprise them. They are well aware of how we play and what they are going to do to combat that.”Schmidt was in expansive mood, as if he had heard what the weather was expected to be like come kick-off, and like Hansen he talked about the closeness of the two coaching teams: he is a New Zealander, like his forwards coach Greg Feek, who won 10 caps as a prop and once led the haka. “They are good guys to have a drink with afterwards,” said Schmidt. “We exchanged a few texts last weekend. It is hard for anyone not to respect what the All Blacks have achieved and it is awesome to be coaching against them.”As with the two head coaches, one of the respective captains will be playing his last Test. New Zealand’s Kieran Read is moving to Japan and retiring from international rugby after the tournament while Ireland’s Rory Best will end his professional career at the age of 37.“It’s all about Saturday,” said Best. “It is about which team is able to implement its gameplan the best and deal with the pressure of knockout rugby. I think we are in a good spot.” Read said that while the All Blacks were ready for the physical demands Ireland would place on them, they had also worked on the mind.“A lot of it comes down to mental application,” he said. “We have had close games against them in the last few years and the fun part is Saturday. I want the guys to be fired up, but we need to be in the right space. That means having clear minds.”Ireland teamR Kearney, K Earls, G Ringrose, R Henshaw, J Stockdale, J Sexton , C Murray, C Healy, R Best (capt), T Furlong, I Henderson, J Ryan, P O\u0027Mahony, JV Der Flier, CJ Stander.

I want a laptop where I can easily replace components such as memory and hard drives. How does one go about finding out which modern laptops are modifiable by users? ColinThe one-sentence answer is that consumer laptops often can’t be modified by users, while business laptops can. There are lots of exceptions, but it’s a reasonable rule-of-thumb.It’s not a complete answer, because you also have to know which laptops are aimed at consumers, and which at business users. This is also a somewhat fuzzy area because businesses can use laptops that are really designed for consumers – Dell’s XPS 13 and Apple’s MacBook are examples – while consumers can and do buy business machines.The corollary is something I hear a lot, though it’s more of a complaint than a question: why do the major PC suppliers sell so many different ranges of laptops? They may offer half a dozen or more laptops with similar or even identical specifications under different brand names at different prices, so it’s easy to be confused.Consumers and business buyers have different uses in mind, which means they have different buying criteria. The big PC manufacturers – mainly Dell, HP and Lenovo – therefore create different ranges to meet these different needs.Most consumers want laptops that are uncomplicated and as cheap as possible. Their desires are met by manufacturing laptops with “standard” specifications in very large volumes, sometimes millions of units per year. Most consumers don’t modify their laptops anyway, so it makes sense to solder and glue everything down. This increases reliability, and avoids some of the support calls that destroy the razor-thin profits made on these machines.It also makes them hard to repair, of course, but laptops have become almost as disposable as smartphones and tablets. Some are so cheap it’s simpler to responsibly recycle a broken laptop and buy a new one. Businesses want laptops that are sturdy, reliable and repairable, and they are willing to pay a bit more for them. As a result, business laptops are tested to provide much higher levels of use in much more variable conditions. Some are tested to meet US military specification standards because they will be used by the police and armed forces, and so on. (There are even more rugged machines designed for field service technicians, oil rigs and battlefield use.)Businesses typically need a wider range of configurations, and many of their users need more than the “standard” specification of the day. Often, they also want to be able to buy and support the same laptops for a very long time. Consumer laptops can change every few months, and the specs can vary if someone gets a bargain deal on a particular component. By contrast, businesses buying fleets of perhaps 10,000 or more machines want to be able to buy identical machines over a long period, perhaps 12-18 months, and parts for up to five years. Sometimes their IT departments repair machines by swapping in parts from broken ones, so it helps if the components are effectively the same. Standardisation reduces the cost of ownership.Business laptops sometimes have extra features such as connections for docking stations, they come with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home, and they get better support. Global businesses also want laptops that can be repaired or replaced anywhere in the world.You can, of course, buy a business laptop even if you don’t have a business. In fact, if your pattern of use is similar, it’s the best option. If it’s just for casual use, it’s overkill.Companies that sell a lot of PCs – both HP and Lenovo shift about 40m a year – can afford to support product ranges that target different sets of buyers. It’s really no different from, say, car manufacturers, where the product line can stretch from a Ford Ka+ to a Transit Minibus, with sportier options such as the Mustang and the Ford GT. PC’s can stretch from mini versions to giant server farms (blade computers), with sportier options such as games PCs.So, if you want a laptop that can be repaired and upgraded, you’re more likely to find it in the business ranges. Examples include Dell’s Latitude and Prestige ranges, HP ZBooks, ProBooks and EliteBooks, and Lenovo ThinkPads, which originated with IBM in 1992. However, even business laptops are going with the trend towards thinner and lighter machines that are less flexible and harder to upgrade or repair.If you really want a laptop that is relatively easy to upgrade or repair, buy the most configurable one you can find. That will usually be a ThinkPad or similar business laptop, or a machine from one of the suppliers that builds to order in the UK, such as Chillblast and PC Specialist.Lenovo typically offers some ThinkPads pre-configured to meet popular demand, which can be shipped the next day, and some that let you select exactly the configuration you want. This usually includes four or more choices of processor and storage, and in some cases, the choice of four different screens. It won’t ship the next day, but you will get the spec you want.When it comes to other parts, download the laptop’s repair manual, which is usually available as a pdf file. This will tell you which parts are FRUs (field replaceable units). If an FRU goes wrong, the manufacturer (or a third-party supplier) will ship you the part so that you can change it yourself. Other parts need expert repairers.Installing an FRU can be fiddly, and sometimes needs special tools or new cables or whatever. The next step is therefore to search for a YouTube video where someone shows how they did the upgrade in question. Many of these videos are badly made, but that doesn’t matter. You only need to see which bits need to be unscrewed and how easily they fit back together.The iFixit website is well known for disassembling devices and giving them a score for repairability, which is great if they’ve covered your potential purchase. They mainly teardown high-profile machines, so they probably haven’t. However, iFixit also has thousands of repair guides written by external contributors, and an answers forum where you can ask for advice. The company also sell tools and repair kits, with iFixit Europe shipping to EU countries from its offices in Stuttgart. It’s a business, but it promotes the Right to Repair as good business.Have you got a question?

Soon followed the ban on immigrants from select majority-Muslim countries, and the statue – closely associated with Ellis Island, traditionally the first port of entry for many immigrants to the US – took on a heightened political visibility: America in theory versus America in practice. Protesters have shut down the statue and hung an enormous “Refugees Welcome” banner from its base, and the statue’s likeness has been invoked in countless protest costumes and imagery. An August 2017 press briefing by the Trump adviser Stephen Miller on the White House’s proposal to cut American immigration in half, prioritizing English-speaking immigrants with higher education, devolved into a confrontation with the CNN reporter Jim Acosta over the origins and meaning of The New Colossus, the Emma Lazarus poem accompanying the statue. (Contrary to Miller’s assertion, shown in the film, the poem – “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” – was written in 1883 to help raise money for the statue’s pedestal on Liberty Island, where it was installed in 1886).“What we’ve seen in the last three years is not America with its beacon hand of worldwide welcome,” Bailey said. The statue and the poem represent the same intention, he said: “The belief that the wretched refuse is made up of iniduals, and that the potential of each and every inidual is as great as the most powerful man in the United States.”No film on the Statue of Liberty in the Trump era could avoid politics, but the directors maintained that they didn’t intend to wade too far into the Trump administration’s political morass. “We didn’t set out to make a political film – politics are so loud and noisy and it’s hard to cut through,” said Barbato. “And so in some ways, that’s why we wanted to make a kind of gentle, inviting film.”Liberty: Mother of Exiles accounts for the statue’s renewed political potency – the film-makers interview one of the protesters behind the banner, for example – while also opening a door to the statue’s surprising past. They travel to France to visit with descendants of the statue’s parents, the French abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye, who conceived of the statue as a gift to the post-civil war US, and the sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi. The sculptor modeled Lady Liberty on another statue he made at the base of the Suez Canal in Egypt, itself based on sketches of an Egyptian Muslim woman. “The possibility that the Statue of Liberty might be based on a Muslim woman – that to me is kind of surprising and somehow beautifully poetic,” said Barbato.Also poetic is the statue’s oft-forgotten legacy of protest: when the colossal Lady Liberty was unveiled in 1886, women were still 34 years away from the right to vote, and barred from the ceremony a boat full of suffragists took to New York Harbor demanding recognition. Barbato and Bailey follow this history through to the statue’s global legacy today, capturing slivers of the statue across the world – a factory in China where workers hand-paint liberty figurines, the official liberty souvenir warehouse in Brooklyn, staffed by immigrants from communist Europe. They tail a school trip to the statue from Ellis Prep, a school for recently arrived immigrants, and revisit the damage of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Von Furstenberg, who immigrated from Belgium in the 1970s, inherited an interest in the state from her mother, a Holocaust survivor. “My mother, who was a prisoner, had written me a note saying: ‘God saved me so I could give you life. By giving you life, you gave me my life back – you are my torch of freedom,’’’ von Furstenberg said. “The most surprising thing is that she belongs to everyone,” she said of the filming process. “Everyone takes ownership. She’s like the sun – she warms everybody.”Barbato and Bailey said they held to that vision of commonality in their filming, making the film’s ultimate subject the vitality of this democratic symbolism. “Taking moment in the midst of the turmoil we’re all immersed in right now to think about the Statue of Liberty, to think about what it represents, this beacon of light and hope – that is important,” said Barbato. “It’s important for us to remember what the Statue of Liberty represents: this idea that we can be great by opening our arms to others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae43ec314809088f1a264a41a5ecdcf286380a55/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de936dc98567794b10787a69a583871","title":"british family deported after saying they accidentally crossed us border","story":"Family of seven were detained for nearly two weeks after crossing into Washington state, saying they were trying to avoid an animal in the roadLawyers for a British family who made an unauthorized crossing from Canada into the United States say the family have been deported after nearly two weeks in federal custody.Bridget Cambria says US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told her all seven members of the family, including an infant and toddler twins, were headed back to England.

She and her husband, who owns a minibus are gradually buying their own home. “I never dreamed we would be able to buy a house,” she says.Such changes are evident everywhere across Bolivia, the work of a government that has invested profits from a commodity boom into infrastructure and social programs.But as the October 20th national elections approach, enthusiasm for this government is tempered by ambivalence. President Evo Morales, is seeking an unprecedented fourth term after 13 years in power, and in a country with long periods of authoritarian rule, the possibility of another re-election makes many nervous.“It’s true that Evo’s been in power too long,” said hotel worker Juan Rivero in Santa Cruz. “But at the same time, this government has done a lot for us.”Until recent disastrous wildfires, it seemed likely that Morales’ re-election was inevitable. But the slow government response to the fires which devastated more than 4m hectares (9.9m acres) of forest and arable land provoked large demonstrations in the cities of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and La Paz in early October. Protesters also expressed anger over Morales’s efforts to remain in office, despite a previous pledge to leave at the end of his third term as stipulated by Bolivia’s 2009 constitution. That commitment came immediately after he narrowly lost a February 2016 referendum his government called on whether he could stand again.A year and a half later, the country’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal – chosen by a legislative assembly dominated by Morales’ party – ruled that denying his candidacy was an infringement of his human rights.“If Evo wins, that’s the end of democracy in Bolivia,” said telecommunications clerk Gabriel Villegas, 34, who joined the Cochabamba demonstrations.Morales was modern Latin America’s first indigenous resident, a charismatic leader who rose to power from humble origins.“Democracy has two faces in Bolivia,” explains political scientist Fernando Mayorga. “Undoubtedly, there has been a concentration of power in the government’s party, but representative capacity and citizen participation have also expanded.”The narrowing gap between Morales and Mess indicates that a runoff is a strong possibility.Much depends on the most unpredictable voting segment: urban youth. Half the population is under 25, and they are more urban, educated, and middle class than their parents’ generation. Most of them have never known any government except one led by Evo.Key to Morales’ ongoing support are the pragmatic economic policies that have made Bolivia the regional leader in economic growth, despite the collapse of the commodity boom in 2014. From 2006 to 2018, GDP per capita grew from $1,000 to over $3,600, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.But how long the economic good times will continue to roll is unclear however.Government investment has grown three-fold thanks to a huge infusion of funds after Bolivia signed its most favorable contracts ever with foreign hydrocarbons multinationals in 2006. This outlay fueled an economic boom. Brand-new construction and cars, bustling markets and conspicuous consumption have flourished like never before.Conditional cash transfers, adopted widely throughout Latin America, have delivered a small stipend to the elderly, pregnant women and children who remained in school, contributing to cutting of overall poverty in half.“It’s not enough to live on,” said an elderly Cochabamba man, “but my wife gets it too and it covers our food costs. That’s a big help.”The funding for these programs stems from expanding mining, hydrocarbons exploration, soy production and cattle ranching – often financed by Chinese state capital.As a consequence, deforestation in eastern Bolivia has doubled since 2015, driven largely by growing cattle raising and soy production.Over its 13 years in power, Morales’ government has moved steadily towards the center with little programmatic differences between it and the opposition. Pro-Morales election billboards promise “a secure future” foregrounding stability rather than the profound change he originally pledged.Juanita Flores, the vegetable-seller from La Paz voted for Evo in past elections, but this time she’s not sure who she’ll choose. “I worry that his government is becoming more corrupt – and that he’s been in power too long,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e4b14d6e05446380579c91e265b716c286c340/0_382_5759_3457/master/5759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d8ed62e5c218a41a82406ecf89e1d9c","title":"could you be an adoptive parent","story":"What does it take to raise a child who has been adopted? We asked adoptive parents to share their advice“You don’t have to be a superhero,” says Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, the leading voice of adoptive families.Armstrong Brown believes that many of the characteristics adoptive parents require are the same as those all parents need. “Warmth, openness and a willingness to accept the unknown are key,” she says. “Adopters need to be emotionally mature, have resilience and problem-solving skills and the ability to prioritise family relationships. And a good sense of humour is essential.”Adopted children’s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Many have suffered abuse or neglect, all have been separated from their birth families and most have spent time in the care system. They need love, understanding and patience to help them overcome their difficulties and go on to lead confident, happy lives.Although it can be challenging, being an adoptive parent is also hugely rewarding and adopters provide some of the UK’s most vulnerable children with the stable homes they so desperately need.Heather and her husband, Dan, adopted Miles 15 months ago when he was just over a year old. Heather considers empathy to be the most important quality in an adoptive parent. “That is probably the biggest one,” she says. “Really understanding where children are coming from.“I think it’s important being able to admit to them if you don’t get something right,” Heather continues. “Adopted children can mistrust adults even if they don’t know where that comes from. Some have never had an adult meet their basic needs.”Dan and Heather were an “adoption first” couple, meaning that they had not experienced infertility, but went straight for adoption to start their family.“At the time, I was working with children who were in care, and for some of the children their plan was adoption. It didn’t feel right to us as a couple to have a baby when we knew so many children were waiting for families,” says Heather.The fact that she was already working in nurseries and children’s centres meant that there was no mystique for her around adoption. Dan had his reservations at first but once he went to a group for prospective adopters, those feelings disappeared.“He realised they were just children, there was nothing to be frightened of. They just needed a stable, loving home,” Heather says.They also knew they had to work together as a couple, supporting each other, being flexible and communicating about any challenges. “The challenges that adoptive children bring are the same as for all children, but the approach has to be different,” she says. “Miles sometimes struggles with separation so it’s about building up trust.”Tanya Killick is a project worker at Adopteens, an online community for adopted young people aged 11 to 18 living in Yorkshire and the Humber region. She believes adopters with teenagers should be open to exploring their children’s pasts. “It’s about flexibility around the teenagers’ emotional needs,” she says. “An understanding of where they have come from is crucial in helping them form a strong sense of their own identity.”Education poses many challenges to adopted children and their families. While GCSEs, A-levels, and going to college can be stressful for many young people, those who are adopted can find these life stages even more difficult. “They need a lot more support in school,” says Killick. “Adoption is not just a point in time, it is a part of you forever.”Claire is a single adoptive parent from north-east England who has two daughters, now aged five-and-a-half and three. She was in her early 30s when she first thought about adopting. “I felt ready to have kids and wasn’t in a relationship at the time. One of my parents was adopted, so it was something that I grew up with. It just seemed like the right way to do it.”When she began to research adoption, she realised many of the children in the looked-after system had been exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Claire made the conscious decision to openly accept that and look for sources of support after she had adopted.

If Northern Ireland decides to stay in by way of a simple majority vote, then Stormont would vote again on staying in or leaving the new arrangements four years later.If a vote on opting in is carried in a cross community vote, then another vote would not be taken for eight years.If Stormont decides to opt out, there would be a two year cooling off period to find an alternative way of avoiding a hard border. In a situation where Stormont is not functioning, the new arrangement would remain in place.In its statement, the DUP said “the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will have no say on whether Northern Ireland should enter these arrangements”.It said the UK government “has departed from the principle that these arrangements must be subject to the consent of both unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland”.“These arrangements would be subject to a rolling review but again the principles of the Belfast Agreement on consent have been abandoned in favour of majority rule on this single issue alone.“These arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland. This drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement.”Cautious statementArlene Foster’s party also objected to the new customs arrangements.“These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union,” the statement said. “Our main route of trade on an east -west basis will be subject to rules of the European Union Customs Union, notwithstanding that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK Customs territory.“On VAT Northern Ireland will again be bound into arrangements that the rest of the United Kingdom will not. There is a real danger that over time Northern Ireland will start to erge across VAT and customs and without broad support from the democratic representatives of the people of Northern Ireland.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald issued a cautious statement, welcoming the fact that agreement had been reached.“There is no such thing as a good Brexit. Brexit is being foisted on the north of Ireland against the democratic wishes of the people,” she said, adding that the new deal “is complex and wide-ranging and all aspects need to be considered in their entirety”.“As a party, Sinn Féin has worked to defend Irish interests from the worst impacts of Brexit. It was Sinn Féin who first made the case for a ‘designated special status for the north within the EU’ and it was Sinn Féin who insisted on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and no hard border on the island of Ireland as bottom lines. We have also insisted that no veto can be given to Unionism.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party will “study the proposal carefully but our fundamental principle remains that we need to avoid a hardened border on this island”.“If the deal does that we will support. I would urge Arlene Foster and the DUP to remember what’s important. We can’t go backwards.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party has “major questions”.“It is a worse deal for Northern Ireland than the original backstop deal. Any deal short of remaining in the EU is a bad deal for Northern Ireland. This is an erosion of the conditions in the backstop.”But she said “no deal will be even more catastrophic than a bad deal”.“We started out with the promise of unicorns and now we are trading in donkeys. At what point do we admit that what people were sold in 2016 is not being delivered?”‘Disastrous deal’Ulster Unionist Party MLA Steve Aiken told Radio Ulster there are “really significant issues” and asked how the consent mechanisms are going to be managed.“What is on the table at the moment is not good for Northern Ireland. It is not good for the union. We would probably in all circumstances be better off remaining.“The DUP put a border down the Irish Sea and I cannot understand how Arlene Foster, two borders Foster, decided that it was a good idea to put a regulatory border down the Irish sea. I said at the time . . . once you put it there we are not going back from that and in every direction we were going to head to it was going to make the situation worse and we have got it.”Jim Allister of the Traditional Unionist Voice called it a “disastrous deal for Northern Ireland’s position as an integral part of the United Kingdom and for our economy, particularly as the rest of the UK can move on to thrive outside the EU, but not Northern Ireland”.“The inescapable reality is that a permanent regulatory and customs border cutting us off from GB puts us in a waiting room for Irish unity with the door locked from the outside.“Subject to EU Single Market and Customs Union rules, over which we have no control, and crippled by tariffs on GB trade, we are removed into the economic orbit of the Republic with the purpose of ’ever closer union’ ensuring the Union slowly bleeds to death.“While GB can erge and embrace the full opportunities of Brexit, Northern Ireland is left behind in the clutches of EURepublic in a state of vassalage. The scale of the betrayal is shocking.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has supported the new Brexit agreement, saying that he hopes it passes in the House of Commons. Video: EU CouncilSo what the hell has happened now with Brexit?EU and UK negotiators have agreed a final deal in Brussels that would allow the UK to leave the EU – possibly by the October 31st deadline, if ratified – more than three years after the UK voted to leave the EU. The deal would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, a condition set by both sides in December 2017.Wait, was there not a Brexit deal agreed before?Yes, but the so-called backstop to avoid a hard border in the original Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the House of Commons three times, ultimately forcing British prime minister Theresa May out of office. This left it to her successor Boris Johnson to try another route.What did he propose?He suggested a “two borders” plan where Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the Republic on EU single-market rules covering the movement of goods, including – most importantly for the island economy – food. This would create a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The EU liked this but rejected his idea to take Northern Ireland out of the EU customs union with the rest of the UK as it would create a second border, a customs border, in Ireland. It did not like the plan to permit Northern Ireland to vote every four years to opt into this because it would have given Northern Ireland’s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party a veto.What has been agreed in this new deal announced today?The UK has accepted that there cannot be a customs border on the island of Ireland so it has come up with a new plan: Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs union after Brexit but the UK has accepted that the North will be subject to EU customs rules and the oversight of EU authorities, including the European Court of Justice (something previously rejected by Brexiteers). This, along with the Irish Sea regulatory border for goods, would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. In other words, regulatory and customs checks and controls would take place at ports on the Irish Sea on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.Is this not the same as the original Northern Ireland-only backstop proposed and rejected last year?Kind of. The new deal achieves the same objectives as that proposal but by different and far more complex means. The EU has shifted its position on this original backstop by agreeing to permit Northern Ireland to remain legally in the UK customs union but operationally and practically in the EU customs union.What?! How is this possible?It’s complicated. Under the deal, the UK would collect tariffs for the EU on goods heading into Northern Ireland. Businesses and traders in Northern Ireland would be permitted to claim refunds on the difference on tariffs if the goods remain in the North or are re-exported back into the UK. If the UK agreed trade deals with other countries after leaving the EU, Northern Ireland businesses would be able to offset the tariff differences in their claimed refunds to benefit from those future trade deals. This was important to Johnson so that the whole of the UK, including the North, could profit from future trade agreements, one of the objectives of Brexit for the Leave camp.How have they solved the consent issue on Northern Ireland having a say on these arrangements?The UK has agreed to drop what the EU argued would hand a veto to the DUP. It is proposed that the Stormont Assembly, Northern Ireland’s parliament, be “provided the opportunity for democratic consent” to the arrangements – rather than a vote to opt in under Johnson’s original proposal – of new arrangements by a simple majority of the assembly. The new arrangements would come into effect for four years from the end of the transition period on December 31st, 2020. In other words, the first vote to opt out ofstay in these arrangements by a simple majority would take place four years after this date. The UK must provide the opportunity for a first vote of the assembly within two months of the end of the initial period, December 31st, 2024, so the first vote would have to take place by October 31st, 2024.\u0026nbspWhat happens if the Northern Ireland Assembly votes to opt out ofstay in these arrangements?There would be a two-year cooling off period when the EU and UK through a joint committee, set up under the Brexit deal, would have to find another way of meeting the conditions of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the treaty underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process, and avoiding a hard border being set up on the island of Ireland. If Stormont decided to vote on the basis of a cross-community majority – which the DUP would like as it gives the unionist community a say on the arrangements – and the vote did not pass, another opt-outstay-in vote could not take place for another eight years.\u0026nbspWhat constitutes a cross-majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly?Cross-community support means a majority of members of the assembly who are present and voting, including a majority of the unionist and nationalists who are present and voting in the assembly. It also means a weighted majority of 60 per cent of the members of the assembly, present and voting, including at least 40 per cent from each of the unionist and nationalist communities.How would this work, given that Stormont has not sat since January 2017?Again, it’s complicated. If Stormont does not sit or collapses during the decision-making around whether to opt-out, then the arrangements set out in the Brexit deal would continue to apply, so this might serve as an incentive for Northern Ireland’s politicians to agree to restore the power-sharing assembly.Were there other sticking points that have been smoothed over?Yes, particularly on the issue of VAT. This needed to be solved because by not aligning north and south on Vat it could create another border on the island of Ireland and lead to all sorts of complications around smuggling and the protection of the integrity of the EU single market, given that the Border will be a new economic frontier after Brexit. The UK has agreed EU law will apply on Vat and excise in Northern Ireland and that the UK will be responsible for collecting VAT and excise duties. The UK may apply VAT exemptions and reduced rates applicable in Ireland to supplies of goods moving across the island by way of derogations.Is there any other significant change in today’s announcement out of Brussels?In one major shift, Johnson has agreed to retain the “robust” commitment made by Theresa May to a level playing field in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change and relevant tax matters. He has also committed to the EU and UK agreeing to a free-trade agreement that would have no tariffs. In other words, Johnson has agreed to align the UK closely to the EU on a number of different fronts after Brexit. It is a big departure for Johnson and a shift away from his “Singapore on Thames” plan that was designed to undercut the EU significantly to make the UK more competitive. Crucially, this commitment is contained in a side document known as the “political declaration”, a kind of road map setting how the EU and UK might agree a future trading relationship. However, notably, this document is not legally binding.So does this deal change matters and will the UK actually exit the EU?That is the million-dollar question. We have been here before. This deal still has to be ratified by the House of Commons and that will come down to parliamentary arithmetic and whether Johnson has enough votes to get it over the line. The DUP, on which Johnson relies for support, has said that they do not support the proposed deal, so – without the backing of the House of Commons – we could be back to square one: no deal.What would happen then?It is hard to say. Legally, Johnson is obliged to seek an extension but that would run counter to his pledge to “get Brexit done” by October 31st. There could be an extension and a UK general election around this deal and it is anyone’s guess what could happen next given the uncertainty Brexit has caused in British politics.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPATo take stock: Boris Johnson has managed to renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the deal previously done by his predecessor Theresa May.The backstop, so key to the earlier deal and so hated by the Boris Johnson regime and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), is gone.Instead, the new deal contains a number of provisions in relation to Northern Ireland. The EU’s chief negotiator Michael Barnier outlined four main aspects:(1) Northern Ireland will remain aligned to “a limited range” of single market regulations on goods. That will require checks of goods in the Irish Sea (2) The North will remain in the UK customs area, but the UK will apply the EU’s customs code in the North. That will require customs checks in the Irish sea on goods except those not at risk of entering the EU. However, it will also mean that the North benefits from future UK trade deals (3) On Vat, arrangements have been made to maintain the integrity of the single market Vat rules, but they will satisfy the “legitimate wishes” of the UK (4) There will be provision to ensure “long term democratic support” for these arrangements in the North. Four years after their entry into force, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will decide by simple majority to continue them or not, Barnier saidThis replaces the original backstop, and is not a transitional arrangement. This is the end state agreement on the North. “What really matters is the people,” Barnier said. “What really matters is peace.”What’s next?EU leaders will assess the text and decide whether to accept it, And it will form the basis for their discussions on Thursday afternoon and beyond. However, for the agreement to be formally accepted, it must first be ratified by the European Parliament, and then accepted by the Council of EU leaders. Both seems likely, though may require another summit.All eyes will be on Westminster after the DUP said it couldn’t support the new deal. Remember the DUP has been supporting the Tory’s minority government in key votes heretofore, but they are deeply unhappy now.Johnson has signed up to something that he said he would never – Northern Ireland will be treated significantly differently from the rest of the United Kingdom, and there will be a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. From the DUP’s point of view, these are clearly red lines they will not cross.From Dublin’s point of view – they have conceded on consent, via the Stormont provision, and on time-limit – the North could in theory get out of this arrangement. But how likely is that? For foreseeable future, there will no hardening at all of the Border in Ireland.And from the EU’s point of view, the single market is protected, the future trade agreement will have the level playing field commitments, and the three objectives of the withdrawal agreement – people, money, Ireland – are achieved.So it’s over to Westminster . . .Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK company blamed its “disappointing” performance on the challenges of expanding both in the US and the EU simultaneously.“With the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities of planning and trading across our expanded warehouse footprint,” Asos said in a statement, adding that it lost focus on some of its core tasks. \u0026nbspCaroline Gulliver, a retail analyst at Jefferies, made a similar assessment.“The complications of trying to do both projects at the same time meant they took their eye off the ball with regards to being best in class for products and fashion and customer experience in the UK and globally,” she said.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ms Gulliver contrasted the performance of Asos with rival Boohoo, which reported a more than 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profit in the six months ending in August.“Boohoo is very, very focused on having a good product, very focused on what the customer wants to wear, supplying it at a really competitive price,” she said.Asos acknowledged shoppers’ growing appetite for bargains, noting\u0026nbspthat the UK market has been “more promotionally intense” over the last year –\u0026nbspsomething that, it suggested, may affect future profits as well.“We will also watch consumer confidence carefully, particularly in the context of Brexit,” the retailer added.There are already signs consumers are becoming more cautious. September data from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG\u0026nbspmarked\u0026nbspthe slowest growth in online sales on record, while total sales fell 1.3 per cent from a year earlier.More specific data from Kantar showed\u0026nbspthat online sales of clothing and footwear dipped 0.2 per cent in the 24 weeks to 25 August compared with the same period last year – the first drop since the consultancy\u0026nbspfirm started collecting the data a decade ago.“The online market isn’t immune to the challenges seen in the overall clothing market,” said Glen Tooke, a consumer specialist at Kantar.“We can link the performance of the market to shaky consumer confidence. It’s increasingly difficult for retailers to get consumers to part with their cash.”Despite the weak results from Asos, its shares soared by a quarter on Wednesday, with investors encouraged by the steps the retailer is taking to address its long-running problems.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations.

Companies across the UK and around the world will be paying close attention to what happens next – and whether the deal agreed can secure parliamentary support.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“For business, this deal may be the end of the beginning – but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.” \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSterling set to erase gains if parliament does not pass this deal\u0026nbspHan Tan, market analyst at FXTM:\u0026nbspIf this next attempt to get the Brexit deal passed by UK lawmakers fails yet again on Saturday, the Pound is sure to unwind recent gains. \u0026nbspHowever, a request for yet another Brexit extension, if granted, may mitigate Sterling’s fall at around the 1.22 mark against the US Dollar.Sebastien Clements, currency analyst at OFX:\u0026nbsp“It has been a dream start to the day for Boris Johnson, as the announcement that he has agreed a new Brexit agreement with European leaders has seen GBPUSD marching towards the landmark 1.30 barrier for the first time in over 5 months. \u0026nbspHaving been anchored solely by Brexit sentiment for many months, the pound’s position is now extremely choppy as the market struggles to find equilibrium amongst the chaos. \u0026nbspJohnson is now tasked with gaining the Democratic Unionist Party’s approval but if successful, we could see Sterling freed from its chains, and shooting up to smash through the 1.32 handle against the US dollar by the end of next week.”Marc Ostwald, global strategist and chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, says: “This takes no deal off the table.”\u0026nbspBut he notes\u0026nbspthat the pound had already strengthened substantially in the past week on hopes of a Brexit deal, limiting today’s further rise.\u0026nbspDoubts over whether the deal that has just been agreed will be approved by UK parliament are also keeping a lid on the pound.\u0026nbsp“What we really need is some more clarity on how the parliamentary arithmetic is going to work out, so it’s going to stay choppy for the time being,” he said.Pound jumps after Brexit deal agreed\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.9\u0026nbspper cent so far against the dollar to $1.29, after the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the twentieth century could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Centre for Cities’ chief executive Andrew Carter.In another change from official statistics, the researchers exclude from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they write.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, having identified the root causes of our operational issues, we have made substantial progress over the last few months in resolving them. Whilst there remains lots of work to be done to get the business back on track, we are now in a more positive position to start the new financial year.Asda workers opposed to new contract will hand in petition(Press Association) Asda workers will hand in a 23,000 strong petition to the company on Wednesday opposing a controversial new contract.The signatures will be delivered to Asda\u0027s head office in Leeds in a shopping trolley as part of a campaign by the GMB union.The union says Asda workers have been told to sign new contracts, called contract six, which it claims will see them lose paid breaks and forced to work bank holidays, or be sacked next month.Gary Carter, GMB national officer said: Tens of thousands of members of the public are backing our Asda workers in their fight against these draconian contracts.Contract six is shocking, the changes are forcing our members to choose between looking after their families, or being able to support them.

However, the pound later gave up the gains after Boris Johnson\u0027s DUP allies quashed his hopes of progress by declaring they will oppose the plan.\u0026nbspElsewhere, WHSmith agreed a $400m deal to buy US travel retailer Marshall and RBS boosted its Brexit contingency fund to £8.2bn.WHSmith snaps up US retailerDomino\u0027s UK to quit four overseas markets amid falling salesMPs urge Barclays not to axe Post Office cash withdrawals\u0026nbspMore than 100 MPs have urged Barclays to reverse its decision to end over-the-counter cash withdrawals for customers from Post Office branches from next year.\u0026nbspIn a letter to Barclays chief executive Jes Staley, the cross-party group call for the bank to help end the cash crisis facing their constituents.\u0026nbspThe MPs fear the bank\u0027s decision, which was announced last week, will hit the most vulnerable communities the hardest.\u0026nbspPressure has been mounting on Barclays since it emerged that it will stop allowing its customers to make cash withdrawals from Post Officebranches from January 8 2020.\u0026nbspAround 15 million cash withdrawals were made by Barclays customers through the Post Office last year.\u0026nbspPress AssociationSupermarkets cut fuel prices\u0026nbspSupermarkets are cutting fuel prices amid claims that retailers are failing to pass on reduced wholesale costs.\u0026nbspAsda said it will reduce the cost of diesel by 3p per litre and petrol by 2p per litre on Thursday.\u0026nbspThat means drivers using an Asda filling station will pay no more than 121.7p per litre for petrol and 125.7p per litre for diesel.\u0026nbspSainsbury\u0027s followed soon after on Thursday morning, confirming it was making the same reductions in price to both diesel and petrol across all 314 of its forecourts from Saturday.\u0026nbspAsda senior fuel buyer Dave Tyrer said: With wholesale costs falling and half-term just around the corner, we\u0027re pleased to be able lower the cost of fuel and pass these savings on to our customers.Greene King gets green light for takeover by Hong Kong firm\u0026nbspThe European Commission has given the go-ahead for a takeover of Greene King by\u0026nbspHong Kong\u0027s richest man Li Ka-Shing.CK Asset, will buy Greene King in a deal valuing the\u0026nbspbrewer of Old Speckled Hen\u0026nbspat £4.6bn.Business leaders welcome Brexit deal\u0026nbspJonathan Geldart, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said:\u0026nbsp“Business leaders will feel guarded relief at the breakthrough in Brexit talks.\u0026nbsp“Business, particularly in Northern Ireland, will want to examine the detail more fully before coming to a firm view, but they will be pleased that UK and EU leaders have made steps toward common ground.\u0026nbsp“As MPs study the draft deal, they must keep firmly in mind the damage a disorderly exit could cause businesses large and small. A further extension offers no guarantees of avoiding this outcome, but if a passable deal is in touching distance then politicians on all sides should be pragmatic about giving us the time to get there.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“If the immediate choice is between leaving the EU in an orderly versus a disorderly manner, politicians must be mindful of the longer-term consequences their actions may bring to bear.”\u0026nbspSo we\u0027re back where we started the day:\u0026nbspThe pound is at €1.1569 having opened at €1.1574.\u0026nbspAgainst the dollar sterling\u0027s faring better, up 0.4 per cent to £1.287.Business groups are reacting to news of the Brexit deal agreement.\u0026nbspAdam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Business communities will recognise the huge efforts by UK and EU negotiators to reach an agreement. Understandably, many businesses will reserve judgment until they see the detail. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Businesses need a chance to analyse precisely what the terms of this agreement would mean for all aspects of their operations. This is particularly true for firms in and trading with Northern Ireland. As companies carefully consider the real-world implications, politicians must do the same.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Let’s not forget, we’ve been here before. There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future. Companies across the UK and around the world will be paying close attention to what happens next – and whether the deal agreed can secure parliamentary support.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“For business, this deal may be the end of the beginning – but it is far from the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.” \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSterling set to erase gains if parliament does not pass this deal\u0026nbspHan Tan, market analyst at FXTM:\u0026nbspIf this next attempt to get the Brexit deal passed by UK lawmakers fails yet again on Saturday, the Pound is sure to unwind recent gains. \u0026nbspHowever, a request for yet another Brexit extension, if granted, may mitigate Sterling’s fall at around the 1.22 mark against the US Dollar.Sebastien Clements, currency analyst at OFX:\u0026nbsp“It has been a dream start to the day for Boris Johnson, as the announcement that he has agreed a new Brexit agreement with European leaders has seen GBPUSD marching towards the landmark 1.30 barrier for the first time in over 5 months. \u0026nbspHaving been anchored solely by Brexit sentiment for many months, the pound’s position is now extremely choppy as the market struggles to find equilibrium amongst the chaos. \u0026nbspJohnson is now tasked with gaining the Democratic Unionist Party’s approval but if successful, we could see Sterling freed from its chains, and shooting up to smash through the 1.32 handle against the US dollar by the end of next week.”Marc Ostwald, global strategist and chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, says: “This takes no deal off the table.”\u0026nbspBut he notes\u0026nbspthat the pound had already strengthened substantially in the past week on hopes of a Brexit deal, limiting today’s further rise.\u0026nbspDoubts over whether the deal that has just been agreed will be approved by UK parliament are also keeping a lid on the pound.\u0026nbsp“What we really need is some more clarity on how the parliamentary arithmetic is going to work out, so it’s going to stay choppy for the time being,” he said.Pound jumps after Brexit deal agreed\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.9\u0026nbspper cent so far against the dollar to $1.29, after the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also be worn by the first ever woman to walk on the Moon, who will head there as part of the Artemis mission.Nasa unveiled two prototypes, one white model designed for exploring outside of the spacecraft on spacewalks, and a second orange suit for high-risk activity on the inside, such as launch and returning to Earth.Amy Ross, a spacesuit engineer, said the new Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) for outside use has been made more flexible than before, making it easier for astronauts to move and bend.It is so flexible that it allows users to put their arms overhead, something astronauts during the Apollo programme were not able to do.\u0026nbspZippers are bad and cables are bad so we have no zippers or cables on this suit, she explained at a demonstration held in Washington DC.There will be fewer seams and new materials that keep the dust out.We found evidence of life on Mars in the 1970s, former Nasa scientistIt also features new technology to better manage pressure and the gloves have been improved to allow greater dexterity.You\u0027ll remember, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they bunny hopped on the surface of the moon, well now we\u0027re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past, said Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.The Orion suit used for launch and entry is made from fire resistant material and features a lighter and stronger helmet, with improvements to reduce noise.Nasa is aiming to put the the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024 and maintain a presence with an ISS-like gateway orbiting around it, in hopes of eventually moving further into space to Mars.Kenneth Bowersox, acting associate administrator for human exploration, recently cast some doubt on the target date for the Artemis missions to the moon, saying he would not bet anything on it.Funding and technical challenges still need to come together in order to meet the White House-set deadline, the former space shuttle and space station commander told a congressional subcommittee last month.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You weren’t moved, and whatever, but f*** you actually. F*** you all the way to the bank, actually.’”Created with Sketch.18 of the greatest gigs ever – according to our critics Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy.

(Elisa Bray)Taylor pointed out that Bohemian Rhapsody was still a successful film despite negative coverage. “Bad reviews usually mean that it’s going to be really successful,” he said.“I think people know a lot more than film critics, and the word of mouth via social media is so much more powerful than review from a guy who probably watches 40 movies a week, and has probably lost the essence of the joy of a movie.”\u0026nbspIn March, Taylor’s fellow Queen member and lead guitarist Brian May called out\u0026nbspthe “vindictive sickness” of those who criticised\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the twentieth century could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Centre for Cities’ chief executive Andrew Carter.In another change from official statistics, the researchers exclude from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they write.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t know if I’d run around toting it as a major political issue.”Mr Bothwell said you would have to go back more than 100 years to find an American president intervening in a Canadian federal election.He said the former US\u0026nbsppresident Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, visited Toronto in 1917 when Canada was having an election about conscription and spoke in favour of it. But Mr Bothwell said he didn’t know how explicit he was.Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, called Mr Obama’s endorsement rare and said it possibly has not happened before but he does not think it will move the polls.“In fact, some people may feel this is an unwarranted foreign intrusion in Canada’s election,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Syrian government is hostile to foreign\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspand many remain at risk of arrest.International aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had\u0026nbspto leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.The UN said this has disrupted the “supply change” of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.“Due to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,” Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\u0026nbspBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: “We will never declare a ceasefire.”Back in Syria, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspa rebel spokesman confirmed that the “operation is ongoing in\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain.” From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front,\u0026nbsptowards hospitals.A briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain\u0026nbsphad been “cleared out of terrorists” along with 1,217 sq km of territory.Aid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence,\u0026nbspwould only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC)\u0026nbspcalled the sudden withdrawal\u0026nbspa “disaster” saying the KRC’s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.“Coordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So there is not an argument for delay. It has to be done now.Johnson himself said that there was no case for delay and urged common sense to prevail ahead of Saturdays vote in Parliament.Jeremy Corbyn has branded the sell-out deal as worse than Theresa Mays and will ide the country.A No Deal departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship or any transition period.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Mr Johnson had insisted Britain would leave the EU on October  do or die - and was prepared to lave with no deal.He said he would rather be dead in a ditch than ask the EU for another Brexit extension.But a proposed law blocking a No Deal Brexit was backed by MPs on September  and was passed in the Lords on September .It will become law within days once it gets the formality of royal assent.In a bid to scupper the legislation, Mr Johnson is calling for a General Election - a move that has so far been resisted by Labour.The parties have been mulling whether to agree to a mid-October election, which can only be triggeredtwo-thirds of MPs agree.Mr Johnson says an election is the only way to break the Brexit impasse.But opponents dont want to agree unless they can ensure the PM cant take Britain out of the EU on October  without a orce agreement, as he has threatened to do.Mr Johnson said at the launch of his campaign that he was not aiming for a No Deal outcome for Brexit but the threat of no deal was a vital negotiation tool.He insisted the UK must do better than the deal served up by EU bosses.He would effectively be daring opposition politicians to back him, and hoping that no other potential governments emerged which could command a majority in the Commons - running the risk of a caretaker government taking power.If a new government cannot be formed within  days, Parliament would be dissolved and an early general election triggered."},{"url":null,"title":"brits on universal credit could have work allowance raised again new dwp minister reveals","story":"Thérèse Coffey, who took over from Amber Rudd as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said that a benefits boost might be on the cards.The news would be a huge win for The Suns Make Universal Credit campaign, where we have been demanding Brits get to keep more of their own cash.She told MPs on the DWP committee this morning: I think it’s important that we need to see what the outcomes are that we want.So consideration about things like increasing the work allowance on Universal Credit before the taper kicks in - trying to do what we can about that element as well.That sort of analysis is ongoing.Last year the Chancellor announced a £ hike to the personal allowance, allowing Brits on Universal Credit to keep an extra £ a year.But she appeared to back away from making any changes to the five-week wait for cash on the six-in-one benefits system, saying that Brits applying for an advance was working well.However, the new DWP minister refused to say whether the benefits freeze would definitely end in April .It was widely expected that ministers would ditch the freeze on working age benefits from next year.The freeze was only meant to be in place for four years, and wasnt expected to be renewed.Ms Coffeys predecessor Amber Rudd had said she was making the case to the Chancellor for finally giving Brits a hike to their cash.The new DWP boss said she could not give a definitive outcome on it yet.Im in discussions with Treasury about this, but until I get the analysis which is due before the end of the month, then I won’t be in a position to say exactly what we’ll do on every single product line, she said today.She said the Government was looking carefully about what it could do with benefits.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

The couple, both , immediately decided to plough millions into their community.Richard, of Coningsby, Lincs, said: “It’s great to know we’ve helped hundreds of people that we’ll never even meet.”  The couple bought a minibus for the community lunch club where Angela volunteered.They paid for a new entrance and cloakroom for a local playgroup, and bought land adjoining the ­village hall and had it resurfaced so it could be used as a car park. The couple also paid £, for three local school pupils to visit an astronaut camp in the US. After buying a bigger home, they decided to hold summer fetes in their grounds.They also bought themselves a £million summer house which contains a ­theatre and library. An electrician who worked on the building told Richard he knew an expert who had done light shows for the ­Disneyland theme park in the US.Richard said: “We thought it sounded fantastic – and decided it was a way to bring Disney to the village.  Now we have a Christmas light show every year, with a giant tree, moving ­pictures in LED lights and synchronised music.  We provide food and put the show on for five nights.  Dferent charities run raffle tickets for each night.”Richard witnessed his daughter Paula, , survive being hit by a lorry in  while riding her motorbike, and now the couple offer every local person under  the chance to take a £ advanced driving test for free.Before winning the lottery, Richard took out a loan to buy £million of commercial property – but he then had to put all his energy into fighting prostate cancer, which put his ­business into jeopardy.He said: “That memory meant we wanted to help others.

Six months later, we continued our treatment. It was tough. I suffered miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy which needed emergency ­surgery.“One cycle alone cost us £, and there’s no way we could have afforded it without our Lottery win.  Darcey and Lexi were the best investment we ever made.”AFTER hitting the Lotto jackpot in June , Lesley Blackman renovated an old watermill.  Lesley, , now lives in her dream property on a -acre estate in Clton upon Teme, Worcs, with her -year-old fiancé Matt McCarthy.She said: “The one thing I don’t need to buy with my ­winnings is a hedge strimmer.  I don’t need it, because I’ve the perfect answer to keeping the bank beside our old mill clear of wild brambles.“That’s the job of our three pygmy goats – Milo and his best friends Freddie and Rose. We had always dreamed of having animals, and the Lottery allowed us to move from a two-bedroom cottage in Hertfordshire into the home of our dreams – which is called, appropriately, Hope Mill.“The goats aren’t alone, because we also have Ella the horse, three dogs, two cats, three sheep and a dozen ­chickens.

There would be a big awareness campaign, posters in schools and a fortune spent on preventing those deaths.But that is the figure for the number of school-aged children who die from suicide each year.In  there were . That’s more than four a week. It’s absolutely horrying.This week The Health Foundation charity spoke out to demand schools focus more on teaching kids to be happy rather than just passing exams.There should be a greater focus on the arts, it insisted, because too big a focus on academic success is harming children’s mental health.Schools need to do all they can to tackle mental health problems, and giving pupils the chance to take part in art, drama and music is one way that could really help.Many headteachers are far too focused on academic ­success but actually one of their most important jobs is to build young people into the adults they will become.I know first-hand how important the arts are. My brother, Sam, died by suicide on January , . I was in my bedroom when I heard my mum’s scream.I ran in and went into autopilot, using my first aid ­training to try to resuscitate Sam. Tragically, he couldn’t be saved.He had been diagnosed with clinical depression in September  but told very few people as he felt he would be treated ­dferently and would be laughed at.Sam was hugely interested in art and music, and I know he found a lot of comfort from them. It’s about expressing your emotions in a dferent way.Too often, schools are “exam factories”, and the stress that goes with achieving academic success can be tough.If you have somewhere to paint or draw, or pick up an instrument and do something enjoyable without any pressure, it can hugely benefit a person’s wellbeing. It’s a form of therapy.I do appreciate that these subjects may be the first to be cut when school budgets are tight. After all, they are not core subjects. But it’s vital that we look at education as more than just maths, science and English GCSEs.Just this week, Andrew Lloyd Webber said cutting school arts and music budgets is “the stupidest thing that could have ever happened”.He talked about a struggling school in North London which has been transformed, simply by giving each pupil a violin and music lessons.It has gone from being in special measures to having its first pupil land a scholarship to Oxford.I’m not at all surprised by this. The real benefit, though, is allowing pupils to find a ­passion and something they enjoy, just for the sake of it.School can play a large part in a person’s mental health.It is where children spend most of their time and where they develop into adulthood.But following my brother’s death, I was shocked to learn that teachers are not given any mandatory instruction during their teacher training on how to spot and tackle mental health problems.So I started a petition, and that has now reached nearly , signatures.Thanks to The Sun, I was introduced to Boris Johnson at the paper’s Who Cares Wins health awards, then last week, on World Mental Health Day, the Prime Minister personally received my petition in ­Downing Street.The PM wants to see a change in how we approach mental health. No one is born stigmatising people on the grounds of race or gender or because they have dficulties with their mental health.If we can learn to stigmatise, then we can learn to be accepting. We can give children the tools to be able to talk about their mental health, right from a young age, and that will equip them for the rest of their lives.As well as providing a happy environment, teachers should be taught how to spot when someone is struggling and ­dferentiate from what is ­normal, such as exam nerves.Then they need to know how to approach that pupil and where to direct them to get help.Teachers have a hugely dficult job. They are underpaid and overworked.But they have a duty of care, and most teachers I have ­spoken to have been hugely supportive of this idea as one measure in the fight against mental health problems. Mental health awareness training has also been found to improve the wellbeing of staff, as well as students.This is important because looking after the health of our teachers is vital.A friend told me that when the pupils at Sam’s school were told about his death, it was like a bomb going off.Multiply that by all the number of ­people affected by suicide in the UK and you are looking at a problem of epic proportions.But just like putting our seatbelts on, there are ­measures we can adopt to reduce the damage. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Insects including ticks may also be responsible.The virus can survive after the animal has died, it can live on in processed meat for up to a few months and in frozen meat for up several years.Currently the disease cannot be passed onto humans, although there are concerns about future mutations potentially affecting mankind.It struck China too, where  stonepigs were being bred to combat demand shortages for the meat.China alone consumes half of the worlds pork supplies.The disease, which cannot currently be passed onto humans, spreads between pigs and wild boars.There is currently no vaccine and no cure, so experts warn that preventing an outbreak is of paramount importance.Infected pigs initially go off their food, before not wanting to move and then have fever-like symptoms, one experts says.They then bleed throughout the body and inside their organs.Up to  per cent of pigs with the virus die by the end of their second week with the infection.The virus can live on in meat or cold cuts for weeks and when frozen it can survive up to several years, thereport.Animal feed or feed additives can also carry the infection.He said: “If it was me, I would ban the importation of soy products from African-swine-fever-infected states.”Experts believe farmers who use organic soy feeds for their pigs or hogs could particularly be at risk.Generally they fear the increased dangersthe disease continues to spread.But take a look at what this virus is doing around the globe today.

Her pal was seriously injured.Mrs Foster, a graduate of Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School and Queens University Belfast, has three children with husband Brian.Theresa May seemed on the brink of agreeing a deal with Brussels on the first stage of Brexit negotiations, allowing talks to move to trade and the future relationship.One sticking point was the frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland post-Brexit, with all sides keen to avoid theof a hard border.A leaked draft appeared to show the UK had vowed to ensure continued regulatory alignment with the EU so as not to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.The Dublin government claimed it as a victory, while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh leader Carwyn Jones said it meant other parts of the UK could stay in the single market.While Mrs May was meeting EU Commission chief Jean Claude-Juncker, the DUP made a statement that kiboshed what had seemed a done deal.Mrs Foster said Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK and she would not accept anything .The DUP had threatened to pull out of the confidence and supply dealTheresa May caved into demands from Ireland and the EU.Mrs Foster has previously accused the Irish government of hijacking Brexit negotiations to promote a united Ireland.On  November, as Theresa May prepared to address her Cabinet with her agreed Brexit deal, Mrs Foster warned she wont accept a Brexit deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UK.She rejected suggestions Northern Ireland could remain in the single market and customs union in a special arrangment to keep the border open.Ireland’s PM, Leo Varadkar, warned he would veto any progress in Brexit talks unless the UK came up with proposals to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now MPs will hold a showdown vote on Saturday to decide whether to approve it. The Prime Minister today said the deal was excellent and means the UK leaves whole and entire on October  as  EU leaders prepared to back it. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker added he was happy about the deal - evenhe was sad about Brexit . Yet Boris Johnson is looking down the barrel of a historic Commons defeat on Saturday afternoon after the DUP and Labour both refused to back the new pact. So what does the Withdrawal Agreement actually say and what are the main sticking points  Hereaposs what you need to know.  The deal is based on a new Brexit plan Boris Johnson sent the EU two weeks ago to replace Theresa Mayaposs -page Withdrawal Agreement. Todayaposs -page draft would keep a transition period which continues EU rules in Britain and payments to Brussels, up to  December . But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic from  January . In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.   What are the main points  The deal is incredibly complicated but any opposition will boil down to a few main points. Here are the initial details you need to know about the Brexit deal. Customs  Northern Ireland will stay in the UK customs territory - putting goods north of the -mile border under dferent customs rules to the Republic of Ireland. A new set of UK tarfs will be paid on goods imported to the UK from the EU. But no customs duties will be paid on goods crossing the Irish Sea, from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and vice versa. That meansthe UK strikes a trade deal, say with the US, US goods can be imported into Northern Ireland just as they are onto the British mainland. But thereaposs a vital exception - EU customs rules will apply to goods entering Northern Ireland that are deemed at risk of moving into the EU at a later date. A set of rules will be drawn up by a joint committee of EU and UK officials before December  to decide how a product is deemed at risk. Factors will include the nature and value of the goods, the nature of movement and the final destination. This will apply to goods whether theyaposre in their original form or not. Sosugar is imported to Belfast, put in a soft drink, then exported to the EU, EU rules apply. No EU tarfs would be paid on personal goods carried by travellers across the Irish border - or on exempted goods for immediate consumption. These would include the hauls from some fishing boats. There will be no customs checks on the island of Ireland - they will be done in ports. Single market rules  Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU single market rules - to avoid checks on goods crossing the -mile Irish border. These are: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. This means Northern Ireland will have some dferent rules to Britain. And there will be single market checks and controls on the relevant goods when they pass between Northern Irelandand mainland Britain . The EU says there will be border inspection posts to make sure the sanitary and phyto-sanitary controls are carried out correctly. Politicians in Northern Ireland will get a veto on this system - but itaposs controversial. Read more below...  The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue in Northern Ireland. The first four-year period begins on  January , so the first vote by Stormont will be in late  - in time for it to come into effect on  January . If Stormont backs EU rules by a simplemajority, the system will continue for four years before another vote. If Stormont backs EU rules by % or more - with a aposdouble lockapos of % of unionists and % of nationalists - it will continue for eight years before another vote. If Stormont rejects EU rules by a simple majority, they will lapse after two years. This sets up a massive showdown with the DUP, because it means EU rules could rule over Northern Ireland despite one side - e.g. unionists - opposing them. Many of the other details are the same as in the original -page Withdrawal Agreement that Theresa May agreed in November . The previously agreed settlement on citizensapos rights after Brexit and Britainaposs orce bill stay as they were. That also goes for a transition period of  months until the end of , which can be extended by one year or two years. In the long term, both sides would aim for an ambitious free-trade agreement after Brexit with no tarfs and unlimited quotas. It comes together with a statement that sides will uphold high standards on environment, climate, workersapos rights and other rules. There are some other less prominent aspects below. EU courts No sources were keen to insist that Britain is out of the European court. But Britain does not necessarily include Northern Ireland - and the document suggests there will still be some European court involvement for the UK. The exact nature of such involvement is unclear but it says: The UK may participate in the proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU in the same way as a member state. Continued access to EU programmes Britain and the EU will work together to see that the UK can continue to stay part of popular EU programmes like the Erasmus student exchange and Euratomaposs research programme. But Britainaposs membership of those schemes will be subject to conditions set by the EU and subject to fair and appropriate financial contribution - meaning Britain will stay pay into certain EU programmes. Free trade and regulation Both parties have agreed to strike a free trade deal which will combine deep regulatory and customs co-operation. In practice, this means that while Britain and the EU will be technically free to set their own rules, both parties recognise that in key areas - including the regulation of medicines, agricultural products and technical definitions - they will likely strike a deal to effectively mirror one anotheraposs regulations. On key areas such as financial services and fishing, the document says the EU and UK will try and strike deals by July . But British fisherman who have long argued that the EU is strangling their industry will find the Political Declaration light on detail - with the document saying that Britain and the EU will establish a new agreement on...access to waters and quote shares. The EU and UK will both attempt to recognise on anotheraposs financial services regulations as equivalent - but expect fierce negotiations as both Germany and France see profits to be made in companies relocating after Brexit. Government procurement In a blow to many people who believed Brexit would be a chance for the UK to end the practice of EU companies bidding to run UK public services, the Political Declaration declares that any future agreement should provide for mutual opportunities in one another public procurement markets. Level playing field As part of the Political Declaration, the EU and UK have agreed to a level of cooperation on regulations, workers rights and market rules which might cheer Labour MPs looking for an opportunity to support the bill. But promises that any arrangement will prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages will come as bad news to Tories who believe Britainaposs economic success after Brexit comes from aggressively cutting regulation to undercut the EU and attract global business. What happens now   On Thursday and Friday all  EU leaders meet for a crunch summit in Brussels. Brexit and the deal are top of the agenda. Despite recommendations from the top EU chief Donald Tusk to back the deal, it is subject to the approval of the governments of the  member states at the summit. If passed, it then comes to a vote in Parliament on Saturday ahead of an pm deadline - at the same time as a massive march in London for a second referendum. MPs will either vote on whether to back a dealor to back no deal . Will EU leaders back the deal   Itaposs likely but could be dficult and tortured. For some, the big concern will be approving a deal which is maybe doomed once it has to be voted on by MPs. So they will be keeping a close on the statements of opposition parties - particularly the DUP, who this morning say they still have concerns about the deal. For some EU leaders, like Franceaposs Emmanuel Macron, they may try and force a tougher set of demands on Mr Johnson - but it is likely the deal will survive the negotiations. Will MPs back the deal   MPs will likely vote on the deal in a special sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first since the Falklands War. The government will likely bring the new Withdrawal Agreement and the political declaration that accompanies it before MPs. But Boris Johnson has a majority of minus  - and thataposs with the DUP. As it stands, even the DUP are likely to vote against as their concerns are not addressed. With them would probably go a relatively small band of Tory Brexiteers. Jeremy Corbyn signalled Labour would vote the deal down, so Mr Johnson can only count on a few backbenchers to make up the numbers. With all that opposition the path to winning in the Commons is very unclear.  Boris Johnson needs to get a deal approved by MPs by pm on Saturday  October. Otherwise, a law called the Benn Act says he must write to the EU in Brussels requesting a three-month delay to Brexit. The government has promised it will obey the law and write that letter. Yet Boris Johnson is also expected to tell EU leaders he doesnapost want a delay and has insisted the UK will leave on October  anyway - deal or no deal.

Bride Lyndsey Holgate arranged for Hull cross-dresser Regina Sparkles to burst into the wedding - donning a dress and clutching a bouquet - while Yvonne Fairaposs aposIt Should Have Been Meapos played in the background. The sensational stunt, which has since gone viral, shows  guests looking around in shock as she lipsyncs the lyrics while dancing her way down the aisle and making eyes at groom Rob.Regina then goes on to playfully hit him over the head with her flowers before exiting the room, reports Hull Live.  The stunt was all Mrs Holgateaposs idea and she contacted Regina with the plan to set up her husband on their big day on Saturday, October , at  Hull Kingston Rovers ground Craven Park. Rob is usually the joker, so me and my cousin, who was also the maid of honour, decided to do a prank back on him at the wedding, said Mrs Holgate, , of  Kingswood.I saw something similar to what we set up with Regina about a year ago and it inspired me to do the same.I saw the story  in the Hull Daily Mail  about Regina and decided to hire her for the stunt at the confirmation ceremony. We had both got married in Vegas in September but were having a second aposweddingapos as such in front of our loved ones in Hull.As soon as Regina walked in to the room, Rob shouted to my brother and then everyone turned around and started filming.    Me and my cousin and obviously Regina were the only ones that knew about it, so it came as a shock. Happily, Mr Holgate saw the funny side of the prank and the act also kept the guests well entertained. Rob went really red, but he was laughing, Lyndsey added. Itaposs normally him doing the pranks on others, especially when heaposs had a drink as then heaposs always winding people up, so it was funny to see him on the receiving end of it. Iaposm not a traditional person and didnapost want a head table or anything like that, so through the stunt we brought fun to a serious occasion. The video went around all the guests that had joined us in the evening that hadnapost seen what happened and they thought it was hilarious. I even think the video has gone viral now as well.    It was definitely money well spent for the experience and Regina was so professional - I would highly recommend her. The experience of teasing the groom was something that Regina Sparkles also relished. She performs as a vivacious, outgoing and bubbly character throughout Yorkshire and pursued drag as a career in  after securing a business mentor from The Princeaposs Trust. Since then, Regina has worked full time in Hull, Leeds and Manchester and regularly attends LGBT+ events in Yorkshire to help spread the message that apositaposs OK to be youapos.Regina travelled to Market Weighton to buy her dress for the wedding stunt and live streamed the gag on her Facebook page.

Trainee teacher Meleri Williams was boarding a flight from Buenos Aires when she spoke to staff as many people with severe allergies do. But instead of not giving out nuts on board, staff from airline Aerolineas Argentinas ordered -year-old Meleri to leave the aircraft before take-off. The Cardf University student - who was due to start volunteering at a primary school , miles away - was left shocked by the ban and forced to make the journey by taking a -hour bus ride. She said: My allergy is very severe and could lead to anaphylactic shock where my airways could close up and I could potentially die. I do carry an Epipen but did not want to put myself in a position where there was a high risk and I could suffer from an allergic reaction midflight.    I explained that I could develop an anaphylactic shockI was in an enclosed environment where nuts are consumed, but they didnapost seem to understand. The only food they had for their passengers was packets of dried fruit and nuts. They said that it would affect a greater number of peoplenuts wouldnapost be served. There was a lot of fuss, I was very upset by the end I must say and then having to just walk away was awful. It was very distressing trying to explain everything. Meleri, fom Hendy, Carmarthenshire, was due to fly on the two and a half hour flight costing £ to Esquel in Patagonia. Meleri complained to the airline - telling Aerolineas that the treatment she received was totally unacceptable. She added: We did not receive any sort of apology, which was also very upsetting and on what was our first visit to Argentina, creating a very poor first impression of the country.    Thankfully when we did eventually arrive at Esquel, we did receive a tremendous welcome there and also in Trevelin where we were staying. Everyone we met expressed great sympathy at my experience with the flight and, I have to say, disgust at the way I was treated and embarrassment that an Argentinian airline had acted in this way.apos Meleri also urged the airline to revise company policy on serving nuts on flights while there are allergy sufferers on board. The trainee teacher says she has never had problems with other airlines who had treated her allergy concerns attentively and helpfully. She said: Everything had been very easy until this incident. We flew from Gatwick to Buenos Aires with Norwegian Airlines and they were very attentive and helpful. Meleri claims she is yet to receive any response from the airline to her complaint.

Gill Britt, now , was just a teenager when she came to lodge with the Westaposs and their family at the now notorious  Cromwell Street in Gloucester in . She moved there when she was just  as a rebellious punk rocker but has finally revealed she saw first hand the vile abuse meted out to the tragic West children. Gill admitted she was shocked by Roseaposs rough treatment of the children but never felt like she witnessed anything she could report until one day when -year-old Anne Marie West knocked on her door.    She said: “Anne Marie must have been about  and none of the children tended to be allowed in that part of the lodgers house. “I remember Anne Marie, a little tap on my bedsit door and she came in quite distressed. “Where these bruises were on Anne, she pulled down her blouse from the top where the lining of where her bra would be. “She had very pale skin as I recall, very pale. She had black bruises all below her bra line, on her chest, on her breasts.  “I did take it in my stride because I was very naive but I do remember how horric those bruises were. Oh put yourself away Anne. “It didn’t comprehend in my head just how bad this was. I remember her lting her school skirt up and these horrible black bruises were inside her thighs. “Straight away she made it quite clear that people were doing this to her. “In hindsight, at , I would never got my head round it but as I’ve grown up and had children and had le experience. “I know that I know that those injuries were inflicted in a very abusive way.” Anne Marie, who was sexually and physically abused by her vile parents from the age of eight, would eventually escape the house a few years later still unaware Fred had murdered her mum Rena and her two sisters.    She would eventually go on to bravely testy against them in court when their evil deeds were finally exposed. Gillaposs interview was released as part of the ongoing podcast Unheard: The Fred  Rose West Tapes by author and journalist Howard Sounes. In the interview she gives a fascinating insight into daily le inside Cromwell Street where she rented a room on the first floor of the house. She says she often played her records loud, insulating herself from the Wests, who occupied rooms above and below but that she could not help but hear the sinister goings on at times. She explained: “Mum and dad would shout from time to time but when I heard the names that shewould shout at the children like aposeffing bi****apos I would think woah she is a bit angry isnapost she   “My mum would never address me at my worst using any of these words so I would think OK we wonapost be going down to do washing today with Rose in that kind of mood. “So there was a lot of he shouting, a lot of effing and baposing going on and calling the children effing b***** and so on.” Askedshe saw the Wests physically abusing the children she answered: “You would hear it, it was pretty obvious, you would hear her shouting out or she would be chasing them in some way it sounded like that. “You could hear her rowing with them and you hear crying or them shouting aposowwapos or aposget off” and this kind of thing “We never heard Fredaposs raised voice, sometimes you would look at Fred when you heard Roseaposs and his eyes would go up into his head and mine would go up into my head and you would just walk away so he was quite aware that she was shouting and moaning, swearing and using obscene language.” Anne Marie West eventually escaped after marrying boyfriend Chris Davis in  but he also revealed how he witnessed the twisted goings on in the house first hand. He described a house gripped by fear which was also used as a brothel with paying punters turning up night and day to have sex with Rose.  He described how the upstairs rooms in the house were for Fred and Rose and the children but that there was also Roseaposs aposspecial bedroomapos where she took her punters. He said: “It had a four poster bed with netting, bloody spotlights in the corner of each post. “The doorbell would go, she would answer, disappear for god knows how long, and then come back out.” Chris also revealed how he was desperate to tell the police about the sordid events at the house but Anne Marie would never let him. He said: “She told me in confidence but she asked me not tell anyone about what was going on, she said this is between me and you and thataposs it.” “We went through this conversation God knows how many bloody times. “If I has persuaded Anne andshe had decided to do something about it maybe there would be a few more people alive butyou had would they have had enough evidence  But it did go through her mind. “I do remember we did have an argument concerning her parents and one day I said I had had enough I am going to f***ing do something and she said aposfor Christaposs sake donapost Chris because they will kill you and they will kill meapos.” Another man with knowledge of the terrible home le endured by the West children was John Fitzgerald, who led Gloucestershire County Councilaposs inquiry into the Westaposs dealings with social services.

Currently, seven millionaires are made in an average week across all National Lottery games. So to mark it’s birthday next month The Daily Mirror has got the lotto balls rolling and caught up with five people whose lives were transformed forever and asked them the question everybody wants to know – what did they spend their cash on     Adam,  and Amy Pryor, , of Maidstone, Kent won £million on the Euromillions in August  Amy, , said: We won the Lottery after a tough year. Our daughter Charlotte was born seven weeks early, with a cleft palate and while doctors were running tests, more issues emerged. Charlotte was diagnosed with a chromosome  abnormality, and was totally deaf in one ear and partially deaf in another. “The first eight months of her le were spent with repeated hospital visits, and as Amy’s maternity pay was due to end, the cost of getting to hospital in London, train and parking fares added to our worry. I was working six days a week and an extra  hours a month because money was so tight. I played the National Lottery online, so my first thought when I realised I’d won was ‘We won’t have to worry about paying the mortgage.’ “My next thought was that Amy didn’t have to worry about ing to work.  “The money meant we could swap our two-bed terraced house for a four-bed detached home, which is just  yards from the special school that Charlotte will attend. “Before, we had put a little tent and a few sensory lights in the cupboard under the stairs for Charlotte. “But after the win we could spend £, building a special sensory room in the spare bedroom. Charlotte loves this room, and she’s started to reach out for the lights. “She loves the tubes with bubbles and fish and we can see her making huge progress. “Better still, it’s a space which makes her so happy – she laughs and chuckles and doesn’t stop. “She’s a gorgeous little three-year-old girl who loves her cuddles and her music – George Ezra in particular. ”We don’t know exactly what the future holds for her, but we know it’s far brighter than before. “And when Charlotte’s old enough to stand up and look in the mirror in her sensory room, she’ll see a little girl who’s truly loved.”  Lesley,  and Fred Higgins, , of Dundee, Scotland, won £million on EuroMillions last July Lesley, , said: “Once the shock of our win had settled – and it took ages to stop watching the pennies – we decided to help out projects that would last, and span generations. “I was a member of an amateur dramatic group, and knew that another member, Chris Duke, was crowdfunding to raise the £, he needed to pay an illustrator for a children’s book he’d written, helping youngsters to deal with emotions. “It was about a little girl who woke with blue hair, and whose hair changed colour to match her feelings – blue for depression, red for anger, green for envy. “Chris himself had suffered post-natal depression and designed his book to help young people talk about their feelings.  “Back in our day, you’d feel blue but be expected to snap out of it. “We spent around £, helping to get the book published and holding one of the first ever copies in my hand sent tingles up my spine. “In fact, to read the inscription naming us and thanking us brought a tear to my eye. “One young woman who read the book said she wished she’d had it as a teenager, as it would have helped her cope with mood swings. “She was so impressed she planned to keep her copy until she had children herself, so she could read it to them. “We’ve also funded harps for a local harp group. But we’ve still got our old Volvo car.”  Ruth Doyle,  and husband Peter, , of Lyneham Wiltshire won £ million on Euromillions in June  Ruth, , said: “We’ve travelled to amazing places like Japan, the Males, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but our most important trip came two years after our win, when we drove a van to Romania to rescue  dogs who had been abandoned or left to die. “We were only able to go on our mission because we retired after the win. “I was an accountant, and Peter a consultant decorator trainer. “When we got to Romania and reached the charity’s shelter, Happys, we helped walk and socialise the dogs, and although their stories were heartbreaking, they were the lucky ones – there were abandoned and dead dogs wherever we drove. “We drove the dogs back to the UK through day and night, and we kept going through Red Bull and coffee. “When we arrived back, they went to new homes. We foster dogs ourselves for  Dog At A Time Rescue.Org, and our own two rescue dogs have also benefited from our win.  “We were able to spend £, on a new hip for Bailey, our rescue collie. “He’s nearly ten, and it’s given him a new lease of le. He and our other rescue, Lily, are like children to us. “We’ve rescued  dogs in total, and  of them have been helped through our Lottery win. “We were able to extend the house and create a large bedroom – with plenty of room for us and the dogs to sleep. “Once a year, I fly my siblings to our home in Spain so we can all be together. Winning has been a force for good.”  Neil Jones, , from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, won £. million on Lotto in . Neil said: “Nothing beats the feeling when a game all comes together in one go. “You break the balls, you are knocking them all in and as all your practice pays off, your opponent isn’t getting a chance. “The Lottery win enabled me to go back to my love of playing pool, and when I was chosen for the county team – and then had a trial for England in , I was so happy. “The day of my trial, I was thinking of my dad, as I always do when I play. “He passed away a year before my trial, and I can hear him now, saying ‘How’s it going, son ’ “He was always so proud, and it would have made him so happy to know that I was that close to playing for my country. “I have a pool room with memorabilia and a table of trophies, and I play six days out of eight. “The Lottery has enabled me to have the time to practice and compete at this level, and to get better and better.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside one uks most haunted","story":"NewsInside one of UKs most haunted pubs - with a creepy doll left in cellar foreverSpooky things happen in the Ye Olde Salutation Inn in NottinghamShareCommentsByLynette PinchessLorraine King:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video what-spooky-nottingham-pub-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news inside-one-uks-most-haunted-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

If there isnapost one strange things happen at the Ye Olde Salutation Inn in Nottingham. Rosie, a five-year-old flower seller, is one the resident ghosts inside the pub built over a system of caves which dates back to the th century.Local legend says she died after she was accidentally struck by a carriage in the courtyard at her tender young age, Nottinghamshire Live reports.After the accident, Rosie was carried down to the caves to keep her cool and comfortable until the doctor arrived but, tragically, she died before he could get there.    Soon afterwards, customers at the pub started to complain about being scratched. They all had four small scratch marks, as though they had been scratched by a child. This continued over a two-week period until the landlord of the pub took a doll down to the cave and left it there for Rosie.  The scratching stopped and since then, customers and staff have continued to take dolls and teddy bears down to the cave as presents for Rosie. Publican Jason Weston has had a number of ghostly encounters over the years. He said: “One former landlord didn’t believe in ghosts and took all the dolls and teddies out of the cave. All his beer went off overnight. Since then nobody, myself included, has dared to risk it again.”  Alongside Rosie there are tales of three former landlords, all called John, who died in the pub and are said to haunt it. One is said to have hung himself upstairs, one accidentally poisoned himself and his family when he prepared a meal after handling rat poison , and one fell down the cellar steps and broke his neck. Of the latter, Jason said: “John is fastidious about the cleanliness of the cellar. If it’s not absolutely spotless he slams doors and throws things. My first encounter with him was when I first moved to the pub.  The cellar needed a really good clean, so I’d spent about  hours down there sorting it out. I popped upstairs briefly and when I ed there was a really old half pint glass of beer in the middle of the floor.  I’m absolutely % sure that nobody  had been down there! “I get on pretty well with John now. I’ve even forgotten to close the cellar door on my way back up into the pub before now and jokingly shouted back ‘close the door for me John’ and it has slammed shut.” Other sightings at the pub include a pirate who is said to have fallen into the well and drowned when he was hiding in one of the caves, and a highwayman who can sometimes be seen drinking at the ground floor bar.  There are even stories of a legion of Roman soldiers who have been seen emerging from the wall, marching through the cellar and disappearing into the wall on the opposite side.Jason said: “Nottingham has always been famous for being haunted and  Ye Olde Salutation Inn  has plenty of stories for people to hear.We have visits from paranormal investigators and ghost hunters because of the amount of haunted tales associated with the pub.We’re always extremely busy around Halloween as customers hope to catch a glimpse of one of the ghosts.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man sue buckingham palace claiming","story":"NewsMan to sue Buckingham Palace claiming hes rightful heir to the throneFrancois Graftieaux, , claims his father was the product of one of the greatest royal sex scandals of living memoryShareCommentsByJonathan Coles:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video man-sue-buckingham-palace-claiming-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news man-sue-buckingham-palace-claiming-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Francois Graftieaux, , who has twice requested a DNA sample from the Queen without success, says his family were cut from the Royal bloodline in the early s following the alleged illicit tryst. He claims his father, Pierre-Edouard, was born out of an affair between the-then Prince of Wales and his granny Marie-Leonie Graftieaux - a French seamstress. But Francois alleges that Pierre-Edouard never found his way to the throne after the king abdicated, due to pressure from the Royal Family and the British Government.    This meant his family lost land, titles and wealth - and now heaposs looking for his gran to be included in the history books. Under English law, the Royal Family cannot be prosecuted under criminal law nor sued through the civil courts. But Francois believes a civil action can be brought against Buckingham Palace itself, which serves as the monarchaposs administrative headquarters. The retiree, who bears a striking resemblance to Edward, his claimed late grandfather, said that he has absolutely no interest in compensation.    He is instead looking for closure and for the history books to be rewritten as necessary to reflect his familyaposs place in the sovereigntyaposs lineage - as he has no children of his own. He said: In the s, the true line of succession was unlawfully concealed to block the Graftieauxs from their place in history. Whilst my father and I would have had no direct claim to the throne on account of Edwardaposs abdication, which also precluded his descendants from becoming King, the Graftieauxs would have become nobility at the very least. As the last of my family of Graftieauxs, I will take whatever action is possible and necessary to protect our legacy and to shed light on one of the greatest Royal sex scandals in living memory.    He has requested a DNA sample from the Queen on two previous occasions without success, in  and .  This week, Francois, who now lives in Portugal, wrote to Buckingham Palace for a third time to ask for help. He now says that,this latest plea is ignored, he may be forced to take legal action to force an investigation, possibly under the broad remit of the Human Rights Act.    He said: I am not asking the Palace for money, title or power but merely to ascertain the identity of my grandfather and the circumstances surrounding my fatheraposs birth. If the Palace again refuses to cooperate, which I strongly suspect it will, then I am happy to seek legal advice and let what amounts to the largest Royal sex scandal in history play out in public through the courts. Francoisapos own research began shortly after the death of Pierre-Edouard in . The soldier had never revealed the identity of Francoisapos grandfather to him, other than that he was someone famous who had not been allowed to marry your grandmother.    After a casual remark by a former girlfriend that Francois strongly resembled the Duke of Windsor, the title Edward took on his abdication, he began searching the family archives to find the missing piece in his ancestry. Francois believes the pair met at the Luna Park in Paris and continued a clandestine relationship for two years whenever Edward could escape from his wartime duties. But when Marie-Leonie fell pregnant in  Edward ended the relationship and allegedly bought her silence. This money that helped her to become one of Franceaposs leading fashion designers almost overnight - transforming her from penniless to plush.

Rumours circulating suggest that a group of teenagers plan to meet up and scrap each other at the Michaelmas Fair in Newbury, Berkshire. Police say they are taking these threats seriously and officers are continuing to investigate the credibility of these rumours. Some schools have warned parents there could be kne violence at the fair after hearing of the rumoured organised fights. Police have authorised a Section  order - which temporarily allows officers greater powers to stop and search people for items connected with violence. Cautionary letters have been sent to parents at several local schools - although the whereabouts of the original claim is unknown.    One letter states: “Dear parents and carers I am writing to you in order to share information I have recently received from another school, whose parents are concerned about some of the things they have been told by their children about the [Michaelmas] fair taking place in Newbury between October  and . “Although the majority of teenagers going to the fair do so to have fun, it seems that some young people are planning to have what they call a ‘stab night’, when students from around West Berkshire plan to confront other groups of students in order to initiate fights. “I have no reason to believe that any students from [our school] are intending to take part in this extremely concerning event, and indeed have no certain evidence that the event is actually going to happen in reality. “However, I wanted to make you aware in order to inform your decisions about whether or not to allow your children to visit the fair.”    Supt Nick John, of West Berkshire Police, said: “Following engagement with local schools, partners and parents, we are aware of the rumours circulating regarding fights at the Michaelmas Fair. “We are taking these threats seriously and officers are continuing to make a number of enquiries into the credibility of these rumours. “As a large local event, a policing presence was always planned for the Michaelmas Fair. “The local community should be reassured rather than alarmed by the police presence.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/barry-smith.jpg ","title":"dundee legend barry smith appointed assistant manager to jim weir at forfar","story":"Barry Smith has been appointed assistant manager at Forfar after boss Jim Weir decided to make changes to his coaching staff.The former Dundee, Aldershot, East Fe, Raith Rovers and Brechin City manager will bring a wealth of coaching and management experience to his new role and takes up the post with immediate effect.Following discussions, Gary Irvine has agreed to concentrate on his playing role at the League One club and long-serving Barry Sellars will be stepping aside from his coaching role and leaving Station Park.Sellars joined the club in a playing capacity under Ian McPhee nearly  years ago and, apart from a four-year spell back with home-town club Arbroath and one season up at Peterhead, he has served the Loons well in both a playing and coaching capacity since and has been a popular figure around the club.Weir has been hit by a further injury blow with midfielder Murray MacKintosh joining Dale Hilson and Andy Jackson on the sidelines after the ankle injury he picked up at Dumbarton in the Loons’ last outing failed to respond to treatment.MacKintosh has been ruled out for several weeks, while striker Hilson is to go for a scan on the leg injury he suffered against Falkirk a month ago and fellow-frontman Jackson is still recovering from a severe concussion.“Unfortunately, injuries appear to be a feature of this season so far,” Weir said.“Murray’s one is the latest and it will be a few weeks until I have a full squad available.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9c514cede9f2.53093169-752x564.jpg ","title":"ex michelin employees among those who are attending dundee foodbanks","story":"Former Michelin workers are among thousands across the city turning to foodbanks just to feed their families.As part of Challenge Poverty Week, the Tele visited the Dundee Foodbank in Stobswell to meet volunteers behind the scenes as well as those struggling to make ends meet who depend on the service.And one man, who declined to be named, admitted he had been forced to turn to the Trussell Trust for help after being made redundant from the tyre factory. vw, px\"  He said: “I lost my job at Michelin and I ended up desperate.“It was just awful and I can hardly describe the feeling after being in work for so many years to be let go and not find anything at my age.“I heard about the foodbank at Stobswell and walked in here and, really, it was a godsend.”The Michelin factory in Dundee is due to close in , with the loss of  jobs.

He captained Scotland Under-s this week to a - win over Germany to book a Euro Championship elite qualying spot.Aberdeen have secured just one victory from the last five games and exited the League Cup quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out loss away to Hearts.Sitting fourth in the table they are already nine points behind leaders Rangers after eight games.Askedhe was confident he has built a squad to bring progression, McInnes said: “Yes, I am. We put a squad together in the summer that we felt can meet the demands.“We spent £,on doing that. However, I have been more or less without Bryson, who was there to replace Graeme Shinniewho was a key player.“I thought we lacked experience and leadership on the pitch at Ibrox. Having Bryson back will help matters.“Ojo we are going to be without until January which is disappointing as I brought him in to be an important player for us.“He was clearly going to be that for me.“Against Rangers I had eight players out and five of them would probably have started.“That is half the outfield starting team.“That makes things a lot more dficult.

Parking wardens will be able to issue penalty charge notices to motorists breaching the rules.A spokesman for Scotland’s Royal Blind organisation also backed the plans but raised concerns about how it would be enforced.He said: “We know it creates a dangerous environment because people who are visually impaired either have to squeeze past or risk colliding with parked vehicles.“But we do have concerns about the blanket -minute exemption for delivery vehicles and how easy it will be to enforce.”A representative for Transport Scotland said: “The Bill is currently going through the final stages of the parliamentary process and is not yet in force.“The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on October   and the new parking regulations will come into force around a year later.“The regulations will provide powers to local authorities to enforce the parking prohibitions.“These powers enable parking attendants to issue penalty charge notices to motorists breaching parking controls in specic areas.“The parking prohibitions are aimed at promoting, supporting and advancing the rights of pedestrians, to ensure our pavements and roads are accessible for all.“The Parking Standards Group, which includes representatives from local authorities, disability organisations and businesses, will continue to meet to discuss the new parking regulations.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5d9c2a43a44b37.91776522-848x564.jpg ","title":"north east health hub a model for country says nicola sturgeon","story":"A north-east health hub will offer an “example” to other parts of the country, the First Minister has claimed on a visit to the north-east.Nicola Sturgeon officially opened the Inverurie Health and Care Hub yesterday, telling NHS Grampian staff gathered for the occasion that the facility was “ground-breaking”.She added: “In all parts of the country the real focus is on making sure health and social care services are properly and effectively integrated and that means staff working together in more joined up ways than the past.“There’s no doubt it makes a huge dferencethere are fit-for-purpose, state-of-the-art facilities where dferent services and treatments are provided under one roof.“So both in terms of the scale of this hub and also the dferent services that are provided here, it definitely offers an example and a model for other parts of the country. It is exactly in line with our vision of improving primary care by allowing GPs to focus their skills where they add most value and allowing patients to be seen at the right time by the right person.”The new, £. million facility, which includes a dental surgery and community maternity unit, will accommodate an estimated , patients in its  consulting rooms within five years, doubling that of the previous GP practice.Ms Sturgeon met Jonny and Yolanda Smith from Newmachar and their eight-month-old baby boy, Cruz – the first baby born at the facility’s new maternity unit.Yolanda, , said it was “nervewracking” to meet the leader of the country with her son.She said: “It’s really nice to be asked back. It was a bit nervewracking when you have no idea how he’s going to react but it went well.”The mum-of-two, who also has a daughter, Aaliyah, said her experience of the new unit had been “amazing”, adding she recommends it to anyone who has the chance to use it.She said: “It was such a nice experience and so relaxed.“Everything was straight- forward as well.”The First Minister also met little Lucy Sophia McDonald, who was born on Sunday night.Parents Miriam Gordon, , and Ross McDonald, , who live in Stoneywood, said they were told by the midwe yesterday morning that they might have a special visitor.Miriam also said she had an “amazing” experience at the new unit.She said: “I had a completely natural birth and didn’t have gas and air or anything. Everything was perfect.”Meanwhile, the First Minister also viewed construction progress at the £m Inverurie Community Campus, due to open in April .After touring the facilities, Ms Sturgeon said: “The new Inverurie Community Campus will be a massive boost for the town, giving young people state-of-the art, world-class facilities in which to learn.”Once complete, the campus will be home to Inverurie Academy and St Andrew’s School, extensive community sports and leisure facilities such as a six-lane swimming pool, multi-use games area and two all-weather pitches."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe do not profess to be experts, but the costs involved in renewing  miles of power transmission lines, along with pylons and substation # plus the removal of what was there before # must be astronomical.What would be the problem for SSEN Transmission to look at burying the line passing across the Tarbert isthmus, or even laying a shortof subsea cable under the upper reaches of West Loch Tarbert  It may have been costed based on the published design, but the money involved, relative to the whole project, would surely be negligible.The company states no #formal objections# were received and that it will #do all it can# to minimise the visual impact.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

refused to extend Article  once again, after the Prime Minister called on Parliament to ldquocome together and get Brexit done.But Mr Johnsonrsquos battle to get the agreement approved by MPs intensied on Thursday when the DUP ruled out backing the deal.----Following days of intense negotiations, the PM announced that he had struck a ldquogreat new deal shortly before heading to the key summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday.But it must still be passed by Parliament, which has so far proved hostile to both Brexit and Mr Johnson.His key ally, the Democratic Unionist Party emphatically ruled out voting for the new deal, citing a series of objections over the integrity of the Union, the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Irelandrsquos economy.Mr Juncker, after holding a face-to-face discussion with the PM, told reporters the deal ldquohas to be approved by Parliament.ldquoAnyway there will be no prolongation, he added, on the October  deadline.ldquoWe have concluded a deal and so there is not an argument for further delay ndash it has to be done now.--vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson with Arlene Foster --However, whether any requested extension is granted is not down to Mr Juncker ndash it requires the consent of the  remaining members of the European Council.Mr Johnson appeared to be directly appealing to Arlene Fosterrsquos party at an earlier press conference alongside Mr Juncker, saying the deal allowed the UK to leave the bloc ldquowhole and entire.He said the ldquofair and ldquoreasonable agreement would protect the Irish peace process and allow the whole of the UK to take part in new free trade deals.ldquoI hope very much now, speaking of elected representatives, that my fellow MPs in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done, to get this excellent deal over the line and deliver Brexit without any more delay, he added.The DUP, which has been in close and regular talks with the PM, had criticised his effort for undermining the integrity of the union and being bad for Northern Irelandrsquos economy.## ldquoThe Democratic Unionist Party will be unable to support these proposals in Parliament. pic zcisdSLkPymdash DUPOctober , The deal also ldquodrives a coach and horses through the Good Friday peace agreement over the issue of consent, a strongly-worded statement from the party said.ldquoFollowing confirmation from the Prime Minister that he believes he has secured a lsquogreat new dealrsquo with the European Union the Democratic Unionist Party will be unable to support these proposals in Parliament, it continued.MPs are expected to hold a meaningful debate on the deal on Saturday after MPs on Thursday approved a motion to hold the first weekend sitting of Parliament in  years.If Parliament does not vote for the agreement on Saturday, the PM faces an almighty clash over whether he will request a further Brexit delay from Brussels as he is compelled to under the Benn Act.October #EUCOis now underway. First up an exchange of views with @EP_President. pic dHRMmMCCqmdash Preben AamannOctober , The stance of the DUP is particularly important because the party wields influence over some hardline Tory Brexiteers and Mr Johnson is far short of a majority in Parliament.Announcing his achievement, the PM tweeted: ldquoWersquove got a great new deal that takes back control, now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.He insisted the deal allows the UK to leave the bloc ldquoin two weeks, just in the nick of time to satisfy his ldquodo or die commitment to leaving by the current October  deadline.Mr Johnson said that the ldquoanti-democratic backstop contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland had been abolished.It proved a major sticking point for his predecessor Theresa May whose deal failed to pass the Commons three times.----ldquoThe people of Northern Ireland will be in charge of the laws that they live by, and, unlike the backstop, will have the right to end the special arrangementthey so choose, the PM added.But the DUP dug in over the prospect of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, as well as the issues of consent regarding the suspended Stormont Assembly.Another issue in the PMrsquos proposals was whether EU VAT rates would apply in Northern Ireland.Mr Johnson needs to get a deal approved before the weekendhe is to avoid a major clash over asking for an extension to the current deadline.The Benn Act passed by no-deal opponents compels him to ask Brussels for a delay to the end of January, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out taking this course of action.####### First Minister @NicolaSturgeonhas released a statement commenting on Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit deal. pic FjeFvQgCmdash The SNPOctober , Mr Juncker said that the next phase of negotiations, on the UKrsquos future relations with the bloc, would begin ldquoimmediately after MPs approve the deal.But this appears to be an uphill challenge, but the EUrsquos no-delay threat could force some to back what would now appear to be the final offer.Jeremy Corbyn was quick to dismiss the PMrsquos agreement, criticising it for creating a customs border in the Irish sea.ldquoAs it stands we cannot support this deal, the Labour leader told reporters in Brussels, adding that it did not seem to have the backing of ldquomany of his allies on his own backbenches.Mr Corbyn criticised ldquospeculation when asked about reports that his party could support the dealit comes with a second referendum.Nicola Sturgeon also ruled out her MPs in the SNP backing the deal, insisting it will mean Scotland alone is ldquotreated unfairly when the UK leaves the European Union.The PMrsquos spokesman said Mr Johnson plans to hold a meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration on Saturday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Juncker rules out further Brexit delay after PM secures fresh deal"},{"url":null,"title":"reports-modern-slavery-nearly-50-figures-say","story":"The number of modern slavery crimes reported to police shot up by almost % in the last year, according to a report.There were , offences recorded by police in England and Wales in the year to March , up by % from , in the previous  months, the UKrsquos annual report on modern slavery said.The latest estimate of the scale of modern slavery in the UK was made by the Home Office in , suggesting there were between , and , potential victims of modern slavery in the previous year, the document published on Thursday said.It said there are now over , active investigations involving modern slavery across the UK.There was also a % rise in the number of potential victims identied and referred for support under the National Referral Mechanism , up to , from the previous year.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant.

It would be a cruel but perhaps not unexpected ironyLabour enabled a devastating hard Brexit to be foisted upon our poorest people.There is, as yet, no deal to put to parliament.

The UK Supreme Court had earlier ruled that secession was illegal, and that by supporting it, the Scottish Government, which has been disbanded, had committed a crime equivalent to a declaration of war against the UKThe European Union has refused to comment on the imprisonment of the Scottish nationalists. A Brussels official said it was ldquoan internal matter for the United Kingdom...Incredible  Fantasy  Of course. We donrsquot behave like that in Britain ndash at least we hope not. But thatrsquos exactly what has happened in Spain. For the first time since the death of the fascist dictator General Franco, elected politicians have been seized, tried and imprisoned, with draconian sentences, for the crime of democracy. For organising a peaceful referendum in .:Protests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatistsThe democratically-elected Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, is in Belgium fighting attempts by the Madrid state to extradite him. Nine Catalan politicians and independence activists have been sentenced in Madrid to between nine and  years for the archaic crimes of sedition and disobedience. The government of Catalonia, elected in a free and fair election, has been suppressed.The Catalan independence movement, like its counterpart in Scotland, has been entirely peaceful and democratic. Yet it has been subjected to some of the worst police violence seen in Europe for decades. Approaching , demonstrators were injured during the suppression of voting in . Another  independistas were injured on Monday.The European Union appears to have washed its hands of Catalonia. Brussels regards it as an internal matter. The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid. Liberal newspapers like theshow their ambivalence by reporting the fate of Catalan political prisoners as ldquoa warning to Scottish nationalists.Seriously  A warning of what, precisely  They are surely not suggesting that an unlawful Scottish referendum could result in anything remotely similar.:Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumWhat should be deeply worrying to the UK Left is that the imprisonment of the Catalan independistas has been condoned by the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament. When the chips are down, the UK Supreme Court will always see the integrity of the United Kingdom as its first priority.:Letters: The EU needs to help Spain and Catalonia find peaceThe same goes for Brussels. Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law. And it has made the case for Catalan independence unanswerable."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A chance to make history but the Booker judges blew it","story":"I doubt the Booker organisers are so ecstatic. Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-spent-shetland-byelection-eu-referendum","story":"The partyrsquos Northern Isles campaign, which included three visits by Nicola Sturgeon, cost just under the pound, legal spending limit.In the  referendum, the SNP spent around pound, opposing Brexit, or  per cent of the legal limit.The Liberal Democrats, who successfully held the Holyrood seat in Augustrsquos byelection, said it showed the SNPrsquos ldquocynicism on the EU.Orkney  Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael said: ldquoThey back the EU with words, but the truth is that they see Brexit as a golden opportunity to push independence.The byelection was triggered by former ScottishLibDem leader Tavish Scott resigned after  years as an MSP to work for Scottish Rugby.Despite Shetland being the safest seat in the country, the SNP threw money and manpower into the fight in the hope of a surprise upset.Ms Sturgeon, who had never been to the constituency outside an election, made three trips, with most of the Scottish cabinet visiting at one point.Official candidate spending s show the SNP spent pound, on its unsuccessful bid to get their candidate Tom Willis elected.:Shetland by-election: Lib Dems hold off SNPThe Scottish LibDems spent pound, on their winning campaign for Beatrice Wishart.Despite being seen as a two-horse race, the Tories spent pound, to get  votesLabour spent pound, Ukip pound and the Scottish Greens pound.The SNP recorded its best result in Shetland in the byelection on a .% swing.However, Ms Wishart polled  votes to Mr Willsrsquos , a majority of .In the  Holyrood election, Mr Scott had won by  votes.The SNP spent more than twice the amount per vote than the LibDems.The Nationalist campaign worked out at pound. per vote, while the LibDemsrsquo was pound..The biggest financial losers among the parties were the Scottish Tories, who spent a staggering pound. on each vote.Labour spent pound. per vote, Ukip pound. and the Greens pound..However the worst rate ofbelonged to independent Peter Tait, who spent pound on winning  votes, or pound. per vote.Independent Ryan Thomson, who came third, spent just pound, or six pence per vote.There were  candidates and turnout was .%.Ms Wishartrsquos campaign focused on local issues, notably poor ferry services.The SNPrsquos campaign concentrated on Brexit, with Ms Sturgeon arguing a win for the SNP would send a message to Boris Johnson that Scotland didnrsquot want to leave the EU.However, the SNP found itself on the back foot over services and started promising lower ferry fares by the end of the campaign.In the EU referendum, the SNP spent pound,, of which pound, went on leaflets and pound, on advertising.

Do something, anything, but make ldquoit stop, it being the pain, the boredom, or in this case, Brexit.There has been a certain hysteria in Westminster this week, fuelled by the knowledge that one way or another Brexit is approaching the end game.Wholly understandable given the isions the process has caused and the way it has brought politics to a standstill. But there is delusion at work here, too. Regardless of what happens in the coming days, Brexit is not going to be over any time soon. We are just at the start of a process that might still be playing out  years from now. There, hasnt that cheered you up Brexit has set some obvious, and not so obvious, precedents and the response to these will determine much of what comes after. Take, for example, what it has done to the way politics is conducted.: EU must condemn treatment of CatalansAmber Rudd, former Work and Pensions Secretary, said this week she detected a ldquowhf of sexism in the way Theresa Mays plan was ditched for Boris Johnsons. May was collegiate and consensual, he was macho and sacked people. Taking Ms Ruddrsquos theory further, Boris Johnsonrsquos rise in the polls could be seen as validating his behaviour, setting a ldquomight is right tone for the future.There is something to such notions, but not much. The modern age of the strongman in politics started three years ago with Donald Trump. Boris Johnson is just yet another version.A greater dficulty in accepting Ms Ruddrsquos theory of sexism at work concerns Mrs May herself. Though one could feel sympathy on a purely human level for the pressure she was placed under, her uselessness had nothing to do with her sex. She was a classic case of the wrong person being in a wretchedly demanding job at the worst time.When the history of Brexit comes to be written, there are plenty of women who could be said to have played crucial roles, sexism be damned. Among them are German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Joanna Cherry of the SNP , and Lady Hale, president of the Supreme Court, whose ruling on parliamentary sovereignty will still be quoted generations from now.: Risks of no deal Brexit set outIn any case, Mr Johnsonrsquos chest-beating, deadline waving, and itchy trigger finger has worked against him. He lost his majority and the ticking clock, the very thing Brexiteers told him to deploy in negotiations, has instead been turned in his direction.It is not Emmanuel Macron who said he would rather be ldquodead in a ditch than countenance another extension to a deadline. Michel Barnier has not committed to achieving Brexit by October  ldquocome what may.EvenMr Johnson does scrape a deal in Brussels his problems could be just beginning. Any agreement must be turned into law, and bills can be amended. Now  MPs short of a majority, the Government will be vulnerable at every twist and turn to amendments being proposed and voted on.Maddy Thimont Jack, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government think tank, told the Today programme yesterday that similar pieces of long, complex, EU-related legislation, the Lisbon Treaty and the Maastricht Treaty, had  votes and  votes on them respectively. Plenty of opportunities for ambushes, then.A more immediate concern to those who wish to see a clean exit from the EU is that MPs will support the deal but onlythere is a confirmatory referendum tied to it. Again, this has the potential to lay traps for the future, not least for the SNP and supporters of an indyref in general. There has always been a fundamental flaw with the SNPrsquos support for a second vote on EU membership.If a vote on Brexit can be overturned in just three years, what is to stop the same happening with a vote for Scottish independence Certainly, you could argue that voters in  did not have all the information to hand to make an informed choice, or were straight out lied to, but the same arguments could be deployed in time against a vote for independence.We know work is being done on another blueprint for independence, but times and circumstances change, and I do not recall the claims in the last door-stopper of a White Paper having a long shelf le. All of these caveats would also apply to a vote against independence. Unless, of course, the winning side had to reach a certain percentage, but that, as in , would be controversial.: Nicola Sturgeon addresses conferenceIf it does nothing , the Johnson plan has confirmed that a border is a border, and that they matter. Hard or soft, still a border. In the sea, monitored by technology, checks carried out in remote centres, still a border. Nicola Sturgeon, in acknowledging recently that there could be a hard border between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK, is to be commended for her clarity and honesty. But the First Minister is mistakenshe thinks raising the matter this early on will allow voters to at least become accustomed to the possibility. The very notion of a border is problematic now, and will only become more soit looks like happening.As it might. Brexit has confirmed what was already known about the EU: that it is a formidable opponent when it believes its interests and architecture are being threatened. Much of the EUrsquos approach to Brexit has been about setting an example, pour encourager les autres. Having expended so much time, energy, and money on Brexit, the EU will be in no mood to compromise with any other nation wanting out, or, in the case of a post-Brexit independent Scotland, in. Special treatment would be highly unlikely.Which brings us back to where we came in, with Brexit fatigue.

As someone who had previously attended protests at NATO summits, I was naturally disappointed in the result. Though I do remember the quality of contributions on the conference floor, and I donrsquot believe that the decision made is irreversible. Indeed, while the issue has been off the radar in recent years, it is now vital that it reopens.One contribution in that Perth debate did stick with me. Alyn Smith said that it would be odd for an independent Scotland not to join NATO. That sent a wider signal to the conference. It was an lsquoadults in the roomrsquo type comment. This SNP would be for assimilation into the world system, as a lsquosensiblersquo alternative to challenging the sane, and measured, status quo.Long gone were the days where the SNP would produce leaflets outlining why becoming a member of NATO would be counter-productive to achieving peace and disarmament. Odd, fringe, perhaps romantic in its approach to geopolitics and lacking in pragmatism. That, anyway, is what those who pushed the argument for the SNP to become a pro-NATO organisation, posited.Yet, increasingly, the lsquoadultsrsquo have to come to terms with the reality of a failing world system. The lsquorules-basedrsquo global order was already irrevocably broken when the US invaded Iraq. Since then it has sunk into a deeper morass. And recent events in Northern Syria, with the Turkish invasion and bombing of the Kurds, have shown the bankruptcy of NATO.:Route revealed for Glasgows biggest ever march in support of independenceIt is time to re-open the debate on Scotland and NATO, and SNP members could do worse than seeking to overturn the reversal of their long-held anti-NATO policy led by Angus Robertson seven years ago.Turkey is a member of NATO. As you read this, they are attempting to bomb the Kurds into submission. The Kurds played a critical role in defeating ISIS forces in the region. Approximately -, ISIS militants are held in Kurdish-run prisons.We know Turkey would have preferred the Kurds were defeated, as their long history of oppressing the Kurdish people shows. Trumprsquos betrayal of the Kurds also came alongside a totally  narrative on the defeat of ISIS, which he takes American credit for. In truth, it would not have been possible without Kurdish resistance on the ground.There have been calls for sanctions on Turkey. And there are widespread calls for Turkey to be expelled from NATO. But this is not as simple as it may sound. NATO is not a moral arbiter of global affairs, it is a military alliance, based on competition and war. And it is undemocratic and unaccountable to the populations from which the nations which compose it come from.It is said that the present Turkish aggression is counter to the aims of NATO. In many ways this is true. But since NATO is a block of countries who are interested in the extension of American and European military power in the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey plays a vital strategic role. Which makes the situation complex for NATO.Even after Turkey started bombing Kurds in northern Syria, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stopped short of outright condemnation.Stefano Stefanini, Italyrsquos former permanent representative to NATO, said that the alliance was ldquopowerless in trying to manage Turkeyrsquos action in Syria, without US backing.Yet you will hear some people naively arguing that, should Scotland be a member of NATO, we might somehow add our weight to pull NATO in a more progressive direction. That, however, is a total misunderstanding of what NATO is.Primarily, it is an instrument of US power. It grants the US signicant rights in our own country, including the right to base its military operations here, and that includes nuclear weapons.And letrsquos look specically at Turkey in this context. Turkey is the second largest military in NATO, with the US in first place. It plays a vital strategic role for NATO in opening access to the Middle East via the #ncirlik airbase. Not only that, the base holds approximately  US nuclear bombs. These bombs have been a long-term problem for US strategists and are a hangover from the Cold War. But they remain, and illustrate the problem NATO has with containing Turkey.Because while the relationship is strained, Turkey still provides many strategic options for the West. Little wonder that official spokespeople for NATO are guarded in their criticisms of Erdogan.Indeed, NATO is under stress from Trump too. He is touring around NATO countries demanding more money is poured into the alliance. To repeat, NATO is not a collective security shield as it is often projected, but a combative, military alliance based on building the power and influence of American interests.These then, are the reasons why supporters of Scottish independence must consider the present SNP position on NATO. If we are serious about self-determination, can we really join a nuclear club who seem impotent in the face of the oppression of the Kurds :Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumIf we are serious about democracy, can we sign up to a military alliance who will demand increasing pots of money Are we prepared to send Scottish men and women to fight in future conflicts over which we have no oversight, as the global state system teeters on the brink of another financial crisis and as proxy wars turn into regional and international conflicts Surely, the answer is no.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmDeerness Distillery is celebrating winning a prestigious award at the Great British Food Awards.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-. Of the ship#s  crew members — many of whom were very young men —  were lost.For more coverage of the events taking place around the anniversary of the sinking of the ship, see this Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It can reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, type  diabetes and cancer by up to  per cent. And it can reduce your risk of dying early by as much as  per cent. This form of treatment is free and pretty much anyone can do it.“This is no snake oil,” says the NHS website. “Whatever your age, there’s strong scientic evidence that [it] can help you lead a healthier and happier le.” You may have already guessed what it is, but now there is even further support for the idea that exercise has a hugely beneficial effect on human health.: Edinburgh citizens part of project to implement ‘exercise prescription’ for cancer patients: Exercise is not just for the obese - Sir Harry BurnsA global  of experts, after reviewing evidence of its benefits for people with cancer, called for the systematic use of an “exercise prescription” to help patients cope with the side-effects of treatment and improve survival rates.Edinburgh cancer patient Gary MacDougall spoke how exercise had helped him “mentally to take a break from the worry” and that during his first six chemotherapy sessions he had actually become “stronger and fitter”.Age no barrierHuman beings are designed to be physically active. Modern lestyles, which mean many people can remain seated for much of the day, whether they are in the car or on the bus to work, typing at a computer in an office or watching television at home, are unnatural in the extreme.But as well as creating a largely sedentary world, we also seem to have convinced ourselves that exercise is something people only do when they are young. This is simply not true. One of the most transformative steps that could be taken would be to turn Scotland into a ‘sporting nation’, one in which everyone has a sport throughout their le.This could be something as simple as walking. Anyone can go for a walk, but perhaps walking clubs would help us do it on a more regular basis. It could be something a bit more exciting, like walking football, for example, or a bit more strenuous like badminton, hillwalking, rugby or long-distance running. In addition to its effects on health, exercise also appears to have a positive effect on our mood and mental well-being. Setting up a host of new sports clubs would take a considerable amount of organising but wouldn’t necessarily need to cost an inordinate amount of money.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England. I would be an idiotI didn#t think we will not suffer first but most of the problems stem from weak MPs and woeful spending.Perhaps the turning point was Thatcher and the Poll Tax. The capture of the Conservative and Unionist Party, one nation and pragmatic until then, by monetarist, neo-liberal ideologues is now all but complete. They just don’t make Tories like they used to.

By Alistair Carmichael‘s lack of understanding on why this piece of legislation has been put forward. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in Europe, and in fact the world,that doesn’t require some form of identication when an election is taking place. However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud. None of the above measures have prevented honest citizens from exercising their democratic rights.The UK remains a country with low levels of voter fraud and the majority of the recent alleged voter fraud in the Midlands related to postal and proxy votes which voter ID at the ballot box will do nothing to solve.Carmichael an obstacle to democracy , says Anderson.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous ‘dark ads’, dodgy donations and disinformation.

Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38568793.ece/13a07/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Traffic1.jpg","title":"5000 northern ireland drivers miss mots in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Checks and procedures on such goods will take place at ports and airports in Northern Ireland and not on the border. The UK authorities will therefore assume responsibility for applying the EU rules in Northern Ireland.Custom dutiesNorthern Ireland will remain a part of the UKs customs territory, so it will be included in any future trade deals struck by the Government after Brexit. However, the region will also remain an entry point into the EUs customs zone. UK authorities will apply UK tarfs to products entering Northern Ireland as long as they are not destined for onward transportation across the border. For goods at risk of entering the single market, the UK will collect EU tarfs on behalf of the bloc.VATEU rules on Value Added Tax and excise duties will apply in Northern Ireland, with the UK responsible for their collection. However, revenues derived will be retained by the UK. The UK will also be able to apply VAT exemptions and reduced rates in Northern Ireland that are applied in Ireland.ConsentStormont Assembly members will vote whether to continue to apply the arrangements after an initial four-year period following them coming into effect at the start of .Signicantly, that vote will be conducted on a simple majority head count at Stormont and will not require the support of a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists under the contentious \"petition of concern\" mechanism. This means the DUP will not have the chance to exercise a veto.If the vote is carried, the arrangements will be extended for another four years.However,it transpires that a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists do ultimately vote in favour of the move, then the extension period will be for eight years.If members vote to come out of the EU arrangements there would be a two-year cooling off period before that happened."},{"url":null,"title":"historic georgian home in co tyrone goes on the market","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s for sure.”“But, that, that being said, my reason for setting this down, one for historical accuracy, two which is a major major thing with me is that Gerry had lied about being in the IRA, I don’t mind him doing that becausehe said he was in the IRA they would probably say ‘were you involved in shooting x, y or z’, you know.“I felt he could have said ‘I wouldn’t answer that to the police and I’ll not answer it to you … but what I couldn’t sort of grasp and which annoyed me was he sent an idiot to my house to ask about the woman from the flats.”Mr McIntyre: “Jean McConville ”Z: “Jean McConville.

Like anything happened when I was OC I will stand over, but I expect others to do the same.”Mr McIntyre: “Did you think that Gerry was really setting you up, shting the blame on to you for this ”Z: “No I don’t, I don’t think he was shting, don’t know what he was doing, I don’t know exactly – he could have been doing that. “But to find out that that clown actually believed him was a bit of a shock to me.They were recommending her disappearance, at the end of the day you could have had a situation where someone in GHQ said no.

And burying them.“The only one I ever would have agreed to was Seamy Wright because of the Hick family connection. “Again at the end of the day it wasn’t down to me. I gave my opinion. “My opinion would always be the same ‘no don’t’. “If you are going to shoot him, leave him out because you defeat the entire purpose by hiding the bodies and it was a well known case that a body had to be dug up in the Tyrone region and left in the chapel after they had buried him or her whichever.

Well the thing is this, she was passed back to GHQ.”Mr McIntyre: “Right.”Z: “Right.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

And three times as many local children had operations to remove rotten teeth compared to England.At the same time, no extra money was allocated to child public health initiatives despite an additional £.m coming to Northern Ireland from the sugar levy in the last financial year, the BDA said.Meanwhile, the organisation has also warned that dentists are struggling to treat residents of care homes across Northern Ireland and said health officials must respond to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.Caroline Lappin, chair of the BDA Council in NI, said: \"Dental disease is almost entirely preventable, yet every day dentists continue to see unacceptably high numbers of often very young children present to have multiple teeth extracted under general anaesthetic. \"The sugar epidemic is fuelling ill health, and we need to take action now here in Northern Ireland.\"She added: \"At the other end of the age spectrum, we are seeing an explosion of increasingly complex oral health needs from a rapidly growing elderly population that is also retaining some of their natural teeth into old age.\"Currently, resources are insufficient to meet the level of need which is predicted to multiply in the coming years.\"In light of the signicant challenges we face, the case for a renewed focus and vision for oral health is undeniable.\"The BDA is hosting an Oral Health Matters summit today at Stormont where it will make the case for \"nothing short of a dental revolution in care homes, where oral health is no longer considered an optional extra\".It is also calling for a new oral health strategy to replace the outdated current strategy, which has been in place for  years."},{"url":null,"title":"three network offline with northern ireland users urged to turn phones off and on again","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

First up an exchange of views with @EP_President. pic dHRMmMCCq— Preben AamannOctober , The stance of the DUP is particularly important because the party wields influence over some hardline Tory Brexiteers and Mr Johnson is far short of a majority in Parliament.Announcing his achievement, the PM tweeted: “We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control, now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.”He insisted the deal allows the UK to leave the bloc “in two weeks”, just in the nick of time to satisfy his “do or die” commitment to leaving by the current October  deadline.Mr Johnson said that the “anti-democratic” backstop contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland had been abolished.It proved a major sticking point for his predecessor Theresa May whose deal failed to pass the Commons three times.“The people of Northern Ireland will be in charge of the laws that they live by, and, unlike the backstop, will have the right to end the special arrangementthey so choose,” the PM added.But the DUP dug in over the prospect of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, as well as the issues of consent regarding the suspended Stormont Assembly.Another issue in the PM’s proposals was whether EU VAT rates would apply in Northern Ireland.Mr Johnson needs to get a deal approved before the weekendhe is to avoid a major clash over asking for an extension to the current deadline.The Benn Act passed by no-deal opponents compels him to ask Brussels for a delay to the end of January, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out taking this course of action.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 First Minister @NicolaSturgeon has released a statement commenting on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. pic FjeFvQgC— The SNPOctober , Mr Juncker said that the next phase of negotiations, on the UK’s future relations with the bloc, would begin “immediately” after MPs approve the deal.But this appears to be an uphill challenge, but the EU’s no-delay threat could force some to back what would now appear to be the final offer.Jeremy Corbyn was quick to dismiss the PM’s agreement, criticising it for creating a customs border in the Irish sea.“As it stands we cannot support this deal,” the Labour leader told reporters in Brussels, adding that it did not seem to have the backing of “many of his allies on his own backbenches”.Mr Corbyn criticised “speculation” when asked about reports that his party could support the dealit comes with a second referendum.Nicola Sturgeon also ruled out her MPs in the SNP backing the deal, insisting it will mean Scotland alone is “treated unfairly” when the UK leaves the European Union.The PM’s spokesman said Mr Johnson plans to hold a meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"what has happened with brexit and how did we get here","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division .The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope.The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills.Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC.A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven.It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago.At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC.Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people.HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage.“It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure.Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery.An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially.This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels.Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Excavated Enclosure at Ballynagalliagh in Derry."},{"url":null,"title":"derry chamber president welcomes brexit deal","story":"Todays Brexit deal has been welcomed by the president of Derrys Chamber of Commerce said: Brian McGrathsaid: “The Chamber has always been clear that a deal is needed to retain confidence, safeguard our future and help grow our economy.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh “As a border region, businesses in the North West have been acutely concerned about a no deal scenario or any deal that would impede cross-border trade.  “We are pleased to finally be moving forward but we are also cautiously optimistic as we know this deal still has to be ratied at Westminster.

people were shot dead when members of the Armys Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in Derry in .An ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, is accused of two murders and five attempted murders in relation to shootings on that day.At the August  parade police officers flanked the band to “prevent a breach of the peace” and later stopped their bus, taking the names of several members.In a statement to the Derry News at the weekend, the Police Ombudsman confirmed that numerous complaints and concerns were raised about the policing operation afterwards but, as they weren’t about inidual officers, the matter was referred to the PSNI for review.A spokesperson for the Police Ombudsman said it received a \"total of  complaints about police actions in relation to the Clyde Valley Flute band, as well as almost  expressions of concern by people who had not been present during the incident.“As the complaints related to the nature of the policing operation, rather than allegations of misconduct by inidual police officers, they were not matters which could be investigated by this Office. We have, however, referred these issues to the PSNI for their consideration.”At a meeting of the Policing Board on September  PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said a “total understanding of the facts” had to be gathered and the policing operation on the day would be reviewed.The PSNI declined to comment on the state of the review, its purpose and what it will do dferentlya similar incident occurs in future, simply saying: “The investigation is ongoing.”Relationsgoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFollowing the controversial incident good relations were said to be “damaged” in the city and there was disharmony between parade brokers.Negotiators, Garvan ODoherty and Donncha MacNiallais of the Bogside Residents’ Group said the Parachute Regiment insignia with the letter F breached an agreement reached ahead of the parade but the Apprentice Boys of Derry were adamant that no such arrangement was in place.The DUP described the policing operation as “heavy handed” and “over the top”. Its representatives and those from the UUP met PSNI officials to question the police response.While Sinn Féin said it was a “deliberate attempt to stir up tension and to hurt the families of the Bloody Sunday victims” and called on parade organisers and the PSNI to explain why the band wasn’t immediately removed.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, and others, said the Clyde Valley Flute Band should not be allowed to march in Derry again and he believed that future parades must be built upon “respect” for the local community.The Apprentice Boys of Derry said it had no prior knowledge of the bands unorm, or the incident, until the conclusion of the main parade and eventually recognised the potential upset caused by the emblem.At the end of August, the Bloody Sunday Trust and the Apprentice Boys held a meeting that was described as \"cordial and constructive\" aimed at “restoring relationships in the city”."},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10341167.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers.

The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered. This will no doubt maximise the benefit of the proposed regeneration of this site for all of Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Funeral.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former Down GAA star Eamonn Burns  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former Down GAA player and manager Eamonn Burns who died suddenly last week.Hundreds of mourners turned out last Saturday to pay their final respects to the GAA star who was revered by everyone who knew him.A teacher at Shimna Integrated College where he was held in high esteem, Mr Burnshelped Down win two All Ireland titles in  and  and managed the team for three years before stepping down last summer.The father-of-two mdash who died following a heart attack mdash was buried at St Patrickrsquos Cemetery in Bryansford following a service of Requiem Mass in the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption in Newcastle.Local GAA teams lined the route as Mr Burnsrsquo remains were taken from his brother Colmrsquos house for Requiem Mass, while Shimna students formed a guard of honour at the church.Among the many tributes to Mr Burns was one from GAA president John Horan who said he had left ldquoa great legacy in the game.He added: ldquoOn and off the field Eamonn was a great ambassador for our association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Mr Horan said that it was with great sadness that he learnt of Mr Burnsrsquo passing and that it was only a few weeks ago at the jubilee dinner on All-Ireland football final day that he had the pleasure of meeting Eamonn and his colleagues as they saluted the th anniversary of the great lsquo Down team.He continued: ldquoThe special bond between the group was very evident and Eamonn was a big part of that. Not content with being a part of an iconic Down team, Eamonn was a man who was committed to giving back.ldquoHis club in Bryansford benefited and in more recent times he was prepared to put himself forward to take charge of the county team for three years and pass on his knowledge to a new generation of Down players.ldquoOn and off the field he was a great ambassador for our Association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Tributes have also been paid by former Down GAA legend Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty who referred to the late Eamonn Burns as ldquoa true legend because of the person he was.Doherty said: ldquoWhat very, very few people know is that in the build-up to one of the All-Ireland finals mdash I wonrsquot say which one mdash Eamonn was quietly nursing an injury. But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him. He just cared about the county. Itrsquos hard to believe that we will never see him again.Bryansford GAC mdash the Down manrsquos home club mdash which flew its flags at half mast following his passing mdash described Eamonn as ldquoa true legend of both club and county while Down GAA described him as ldquotrue son of Down.They said: ldquoEamonn has been taken from us too soon, we will miss you Eamonn but we will smile in the memory of the days that you gave us.Last Sunday, Eamonn Burnsrsquo sons Cathal and Thomas led the Down  team onto pitch in memory of father ahead of senior football final between Warrenpoint and Kilcoo at Pairc Esler, Newry.

The acts included opera with performers on horseback.ldquoThe horses were retired race horses which had been re-trained to perform in this show. There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council.

We talked about a lot of the issues regarding who has complained and itrsquos a very small group of people.ldquoAs compared to the picture painted for them by neighbours, [the council] were surprised at what we were doing and how compliant wersquore already being.ldquoWersquore hopeful of a positive outcome but we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen.ldquoWe have had thousands of messages of support from emails and twitter messages. Mostly itrsquos people seeing itrsquos such a positive thing wersquore doing.Marcus Goldsworthy, head of planning and regeneration at Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoA planning application has been submitted for the temporary use of a former residential annex as a school.ldquoThe application remains under consideration and planning officers have met with the applicant and her agents to discuss the further information that is required to support the application, and allow it to be fully considered. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop.

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We are deeply sorry to anyone who has been affected by these unacceptable behaviours.mdash The BMAOctober , The report said: ldquoThis is because of an lsquoold boyrsquos clubrsquo culture for some that lingers on without proper challenge, which treats women as of less importance and ability.She said some women were not viewed as ldquoreal doctors because they work part-time, while conversations ldquofocus on asking them about their children, and how their husbands are coping with their absence, rather than asking them about their achievements, their career aspirations and their views on policy.The report went on: ldquoFemale staff with university degrees are told to make the tea, or asked whether they want to come and work as a doctorrsquos secretary or P.A some have been told, lsquoyou have a lot to prove because yoursquore a womanrsquo.Ms Romney also found women having their concerns belittled or ignored, while others were shouted at, sexually harassed,bullied, or excluded from committees on which they sat.An ldquoexcessive consumption of alcohol at conferences also lead to incidents of sexual harassment.ldquoThis includes being touched inappropriately, lewd and inappropriate sexual remarks directed to, or made about women, invitations or even instructions to accompany a male doctor to his hotel room, staring at a womanrsquos breasts, inappropriate comments about a womanrsquos appearance, and being kissed or hugged, the report said.It added: ldquoWomen are consistently made to feel that they are of less importance, and are less capable, than a man for example, what they say does not carry the same weight.Some women also reported meetings taking place in their absence without their knowledge.In one meeting, a female member of staff was given responsibility for a piece of work ldquobut at the meeting discussing it, the male doctors presentall addressed themselves to her male colleague.The report said women are outnumbered on committees ndash for example, on the GPs committee men outnumber women by two to one, even though% of GPs are women.Ms Romney recommended that quotas or minimum numbers are introduced for women on committees ndash a move she said she expected would beldquovery unpopular.The report also said there ldquohas been a failure of leadership for too long throughout the BMA in calling out bad behaviour, including sex discrimination, sexual harassment, rudeness and bullying of all kinds.Ms Romneyrsquos review was announced in April after two senior female GPs accused colleagues of sexism in an article for GP online.Katie Bramall-Stainer and Zoe Norris reported instances of belittling, having theirthighs and buttocks fondled, being propositioned and having senior male colleagues trying to guess bra sizes.Ms Norris told GP Online on Thursday she and colleagues felt ldquovindicated and enormously relieved by Ms Romneyrsquos report.ldquoThe last few months have been extremely dficult ndash we have been subjected to abuse and accusations about our motivations in speaking out, she said.ldquoWe have been treated shockingly.But she said she believed there is ldquonow an opportunity for real change to happen within the BMA.BMA chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, pledged to implement the recommendations, adding: ldquoI am truly appalled to learn that members and staff have been subjected to sexism and sexual harassment and the behaviours described in this report. These behaviours have no place within the BMA.ldquoI am deeply sorry to those who have been affected and I thank all those iniduals who came forward to contribute to the review ndash I recognise their strength and courage in speaking out.Dr Helena McKeown, a chief officer at the BMA and representative body chairwoman, said: ldquoI am of an age where sexism has pervaded so many parts of my personal and working le for too long.ldquoItrsquos not just within the BMA, but that doesnrsquot mean we accept it we donrsquot, and we wonrsquot.BMA chief executive, Tom Grinyer, said he would introduce an externalof safe working and internal staff listening champions for all involved in the BMA.ldquoI arrived in July determined to tackle these cultural issues and this report gives us clear recommendations to do that, he added.In line with Ms Romneyrsquos recommendations, the BMA has launched an independent and external -hour support line, and an independent complaints investigation process carried out by an external firm.Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS Englandrsquos medical director of primary care and a south-east London GP, said: ldquoThe findings of the independent investigation into the claims of sexism and sexual harassment within the BMA are appalling.ldquoThis sort of behaviour is unacceptable in any walk of le, and people who treat women in this way have no place in our profession and no place in our leadership..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Women harassed and undermined as part of BMA  uold boy us club u  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is a choice I am determined to ensure is given to the people of Scotland.Wersquove got a great new deal that takes back control mdash now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControlmdash Boris JohnsonOctober , Announcing the deal on Twitter, Mr Johnson said: ldquoWe will leave the EUrsquos Customs Union as one United Kingdom and be able to strike trade deals all around the world.ldquoThis new deal ensures that we #TakeBackControl of our laws, borders, money and trade without disruption  establishes a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly cooperation.ldquoThis is a deal which allows us to get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeksrsquo time, so we can then focus on the peoplersquos priorities and bring the country back together again.ldquoThis new deal takes back control.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Also, many of the immigrant families are moving where due the uncertainty of their status on the outcome of Brexit.”However Mr Buckley said: ”It is very sad to see that unfortunately Richmount Playgroup has had to close its doors. I would like to pay tribute to the staff and community leaders who had the vision to open up the playgroup.“Having liaised and worked directly with the the Playgroup committee, parents and the education authority to try and save the playgroup it became clear that under the current low numbers it was going to be hard to sustain.“The committee took the decision to inform parents that the playgroup would be closing. I understand this has been dficult for parents and staff involved.“I must stress despite what is being reported, at no time was it indicated by the committee, parents or indeed the Education Authority that this decision was Brexit related.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
