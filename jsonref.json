For City, that’s enough to be hot favourites for yet another Premier League title. For Sporting, it’s not enough, as they find themselves six points behind Porto, who are unbeaten. But it does show how resilient they have become under Rúben Amorim. When the world seems to shine like you’ve had too much wine, that’s Amorim. After inheriting a shambles two years ago, this rookie manager, still only 37, has led Sporting to a league title, two league-cup triumphs and this, the second Champions League knockout tie in their history. He may prefer to draw a veil over the first: back in 2008-09 Sporting managed to lose 12-1 on aggregate to Bayern Munich, setting a record for the heaviest knockout defeat in the tournament that stands to this day. Another drubbing is all too possible here. According to Nate Silver’s prediction machine, City have a 70pc chance of a win tonight, making this the second most lop-sided tie of the round behind Chelsea-Lille. If that sounds like a recipe for complacency, four of City’s best players will bring an extra motivation: Ederson, Rúben Dias, Joao Cancelo and Bernardo Silva are all alumni of Benfica, Sporting’s deadly rivals.  Still, as Pep Guardiola pointed out in his press conference, Sporting were good enough at the group stage to edge out Borussia Dortmund. And, as he didn’t go on to say, they’ve seen off City over two legs before – in their only previous meeting, a Europa League quarter-final ten years ago. So you’d have to say the home side have a Sporting chance. That win, by the way, came on away goals, the funny old tie-breaker that has now been binned. No more of those Monaco nightmares for Pep no more of those intriguing calculations for the rest of us.

We announced billions in funding allocations to put people to work in good-paying jobs, cleaning up rivers in Ohio, chemical plants in Florida and dozens of other sites, bolstering the energy grid with stronger transmission lines and towers and modernizing bridges.”  Biden continued: “This is only the beginning: hundreds of billions in new investments are on their way. Now it’s time for the counties to get ready.” Senator Joe Manchin, a Virginia Democrat, urged senators to oppose Califf’s appointment earlier this week, saying he bears “a great deal of responsibility” for many of the US opioid overdose deaths in the years since Califf’s first stint as FDA commissioner under the Obama administration.  The Associated Press reports that at that time, Califf “added new warning labels to opioids and commissioned outside recommendations on how to tighten regulation of the drugs. But he was replaced by President Donald Trump before implementing any major changes.” Califf has promised to launch a review of opioids as one of his first actions in his new role.The 50-46 vote means Dr Robert Califf, a cardiologist, will helm the agency, which regulates billion-dollar industries including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as well as most foods on sale in the US.  Califf previously held the job for 11 months in the final years of Obama administration after securing overwhelming support in the senate - a contrast to Tuesday’s tight result.

This will be the first time a gunmaker is held responsible for a mass shooting in the US, and comes one day after the four-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, when Joe Biden called for such accountability to take place.  “Congress must do much more – beginning with requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers,” Biden said.  Details of the settlement are still unclear, but in July, Remington offered $33m, which was substantially less than what the victims’ families were seeking. In a February court filing, their attorneys estimated the wrongful death claims likely totalled in excess of $225m, rising above $1bn with punitive damages.Punchbowl News is reporting that the senate is currently stuck on two unrelated government funding snafus. One of the two snafus stems from Marsha Blackburn, the Republican senator from Tennessee, who is holding out on a three-week stopgap funding bill because she believes that the Biden administration is trying to set aside money to hand out crack pipes. Though the White House has denied this, Blackburn is allegedly waiting on the Biden administration to formally respond to her concerns before she allows the bill to go through. The last tussle comes from several Republican senators, led by Mike Lee of Utah, who are demanding a vote on the amendment to ban the federal government from funding a vaccine mandate for federal workers, contractors and the military.  However, Punchbowl News noted that these last-minute disputes have become standard for the senate ahead of funding talks, and will likely be resolved - there likely won’t be a shutdown. ’s Dominic Rushe has more details here:  As it has been in recent weeks, much of the focus in Washington has been on Ukraine, and the imminent threat of a Russian invasion.

Photograph: iStockIt is the largest study abroad programme of its type in the world. In fact, it has been so successful that the term “Erasmus” is now the internationally understood shorthand for those who study abroad no matter what the funding background.Since it was established 35 years ago, millions of students across Europe have left the comfort zone of their home institution to spend study or traineeship visits in another European country, among them tens of thousands of students from Ireland.For the first time in the history of the Erasmus programme, the Irish Government is to dip into the national purse to provide financial support for students seeking to study and work abroad. A surge in demand has left the Erasmus+ national agency at the Higher Education Authority (HEA) seriously short of funds.A co-fund of €7 million is being made available by Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris in two tranches – €3.5 million in 2022 and €3.5 million in 2023 – to help bridge the shortfall. The Government also anticipates that freeing up more places in Ireland will enable the sector to admit more fellow Europeans who would normally have gone to the United Kingdom.This welcome intervention has been made necessary by a massive 66 per cent increase in demand for places on the programme under the 2021-22 call. The HEA’s Erasmus+ national agency, which manages the higher education element of the programme received applications for more than 8,700 study and work abroad periods from the participating higher education institutions compared to 5,500 for the 2020-21 year.But a huge problem resulted when the European Commission was not in a position to provide the promised additional funding at the start of the latest iteration of the programme, which covers the period 2021-27.The national agency has had its budget for the 2021-22 academic year slashed by €3 million (a 25 per cent cut) down to €9 million compared to €12 million for 2020-21. This dip will be recovered from 2023 when EU funds will rise appreciably.Without the Government funds, the agency would only be able to support about 3,200 student mobilities and 250 staff visits. Thanks to the additional €3.5 million, another 1,500 iniduals can be assisted in 2022 and a similar number in 2023.The commitment does not extend beyond 2023. By then, the Government expects the extra funds from the European Commission will kick in. Applications always exceed actual realised mobilities with the highest outward-bound number to date being recorded in 2019 at 3,995. A realisation of 4,700 mobilities by summer 2022 will be a national record.The challenge is mainly felt by the eight Irish University Association universities plus Munster Technological University who account for some 87 per cent of total outbound numbers.Those with the largest growth are University of Limerick (+364), NUI Galway (+326), Trinity College Dublin (+264), University College Dublin (+261), Dublin City University (+170) and TU Dublin (+100).Driving the numbersComing off the back of a very travel unfriendly Covid landscape, the rise in demand is somewhat surprising. A significant feature driving the numbers is the fact that 1,500 mobilities are for students who must spend mandatory spells of one or two semesters of their degree programmes abroad.Other reasons posited are the greater flexibilities offered under the new programme, which, subject to certain conditions, permit study abroad periods of as short as five to 30 days compared to the traditional minimum two months studywork stays.Another very positive development has been the decision by the European Commission to provide mandatory supplementary social inclusion support of €250 per month.The net result of this is that a Susi (Student Universal Support Ireland) student will be able to receive roughly €550 for a study visit (up from €480) and €670 for a traineeshipwork placement (compared to €500 per month, maximum). The Erasmus+ national agency voluntarily introduced top-up social inclusion support in 2014 and was heading for a 20 per cent participation rate from Susi recipients before the pandemic struck.The Covid-19 pandemic has badly disrupted the student “experience” over the last two years. Remote learning and close campuses took their toll. With savings from the pandemic unemployment payment in the bank, students may have a bit more disposable income in their pockets to recover some of that lost learning by embarking on a studywork period in another EUEEA country."},{"url":null,"title":"local and regional road funding for 2022 up 4 to nearly 600m","story":"Flooding on Droichead Charraig a Logáin which erodes the surface. Overall funding to repair roads countrywide will increase to €597 million following the Government announcement of a 4 per cent increase in regional and local road funding for 2022 Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said overall funding would be higher as the exchequer grants are intended to “supplement local authorities’ own expenditure on regional and local road projects”. He said the grants do not represent the total investment in regional and local roads for this year.But additional cash to remedy problems on routes across the State has failed to resolve problems in many localities. And one such area is Ros Muc in the Connemara Gaeltacht.“The roads in the area have no cycle lanes, no walkways, not even a white line. There is a road in Ros Muc past the football field and passing Pádraig Pearse’s cottage which is only a cluster of potholes. We have the worst regional and local roads in Ireland,” said Co Galway resident Mánus Ó Conaire of Iorras Aithneach. “A 4 per cent increase is not going to change that, unfortunately.” Mr Ó Conaire is a veteran campaigner for better roads in the Connemara region. He represents Bóithre Chonamara (Connemara Roads group) in discussions with Galway County Council engineers and believes inflation is likely to absorb the increase. “Senior management in the council have always told us they would like to do the work, but they don’t have the money,” he said.Agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil muid glórach faoina droichid. Bígí cúramach amuigh ansin inniu a chlann 🌁☔🌂☁️ https:t.covzeRTSSxNV— Bóithre ChonamaraConnemara Roads (@BoithreR) He noted four bridges in the area which, like many roads in Connemara, were not wide enough to qualify for designation of regional road status. “Some of those bridges have cracks in them,” he said. Mr Ó Conaire said he heard there is money in Co Galway’s allocation to restore several of the bridges, but queried the meaning of restore. Bóithre Chonamara’s social media is populated with videos and images of damaged roads and bridges as well as interviews with locals. Footage includes routes that have been spray painted to alert users to subsidence hazards and potholes. Road safetyThe funding will allow about 3,100km of roads to be maintained and 2,550km to be strengthened.Minister for State at the Department of Transport Hildegarde Naughton, a Galway West TD, said the grant represented “a 28 percent increase in funding for local roads since 2019.” The Minister said the resource will help Galway city and county councils ensure improved connectivity, but will also enable them invest in road safety across the county. Ms Naughton referred specifically to the county’s allocation on Galway Bay FM: “We’ll be looking at investing in bridge rehabilitation across Galway, including at Leitir Mór, the Salmon Weir Bridge and the bridge on Millstreet.“And we’ll be looking to tackle roads affected by flooding, which is a safety concern. We’ll be looking at places like the Dyke Road and Merchants Road.” The full allocation of funding by local authority is available hereStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"planning regulator knocks back dublin build to rent curbs","story":"City planner John O’Hara last month said the policy changes were an attempt to return a ‘ersity’ of housing types to Dublin City. Photograph: iStockThe planning regulator is to block attempts by Dublin City Council to introduce a number of tight controls on the development of build-to-rent (BTR) apartment blocks in the city.Deputy regulator Anne Marie O’Connor has told the council not to go ahead with measures to stop developers from building blocks with no homes for sale, and to omit from the city development plan restrictions on numbers of studio and one-bed apartments included in a scheme.The draft development plan would require BTR schemes of more than 100 homes to have at least 40 per cent of properties available for sale. BTR schemes of fewer than 100 homes would generally not be permitted, as they would not have a “critical mass” to support good communal facilities.The plan also restricts studio and one-bed apartments to a maximum of 30 per cent of a development, a provision which would apply in particular to areas such as north inner city and Liberties, which already have a high proportion of smaller apartments.City planner John O’Hara last month said the policy changes were an attempt to return a “ersity” of housing types to the city. “Build-to-rent has only emerged in the last three years, but it has largely displaced build-to sell altogether,” he said.Ms O’Connor said while it appeared the policies were “a response to the City Council’s observed trend of nearly all recent planning applications for apartment development being BTR schemes,” they were in breach of national policies and ministerial guidelines.Specifying 40 per cent of apartments had to be available for sale would mean those units would have to comply with higher standards than build to rent schemes. Similarly, she said there was “no national or regional policy basis, or any other evidence provided, to support the view that a scheme of less than 100 units cannot provide meaningful communal facilities and services”.In relation to the curbs on the numbers of smaller apartments she said this would also conflict with Ministerial guidelines on BTR schemes which stated there should be “no restrictions on dwelling mix”.She told the council it was required to omit or amend the policies which were inconsistent with the ministerial guidelines. However she said the regulator “understands and acknowledges the context for the proposal of these policies by the planning authority in terms of failing to secure a reasonable mix of housing in an area or the potential of an undue concentration of BTR developments that may be presenting in particular parts of its area”.The council’s proposed policy that applications for BTR would be accompanied by an assessment of other permitted BTR developments within 3km to demonstrate there would not be an over-concentration of one housing tenure was “a reasonable requirement” she said and provided a “strong policy basis that would empower the City Council” to address the over-concentration issue.Overall she said the regulator “endorses the majority of the housing policies” in the city plan.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"moscow ready to engage in talks with the us and nato over missile deployments putin","story":"Some troops in Russia\u0027s military districts adjacent to Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills, Russia\u0027s defence ministry has said.

(Photo by Mikhail Klimentyev  Sputnik  AFP) (Photo by MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEVSputnikAFP via Getty Images)Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready for talks with the US and Nato on limits for missile deployments and military transparency.Speaking after talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Mr Putin said the US and Nato had rejected his demand to keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of Nato, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders and roll back alliance forces from eastern Europe. They agreed to discuss a range of security measures that Russia had previously proposed.Mr Putin said Moscow is ready to engage in talks on limits on the deployment of intermediate range missiles in Europe, transparency of drills and other confidence-building measures, but emphasised the need for the West to heed Russia’s main demands.The statement came after the Russian Defence Ministry announced a partial pullback of troops following military drills, adding to hopes that the Kremlin may not be planning to invade Ukraine imminently.The Russian military gave no details on where the troops were pulling back from, or how many.Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine. Earlier Russia’s defence ministry was quoted as saying that some troops in Russia’s military districts adjacent to Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills. Russia’s Interfax news agency cited the ministry as saying that while large-scale drills across the country continued, some units of the southern and western military districts have completed their exercises and started returning to base.EncircledRussia has amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, prompting fears of an invasion, especially as Moscow’s February 10th-20th joint drills with Belarus mean that Ukraine is almost encircled by the Russian military.Although Moscow has denied ever planning to attack Ukraine, it has demanded legally binding guarantees from the United States and Nato that Kyiv will not be allowed to join the military bloc. Washington and Brussels have so far refused to make such pledges.Nato’s chief on Tuesday welcomed signals that Russia may be looking for a diplomatic solution amid a military build-up on Ukraine’s border but urged Moscow to demonstrate its will to act.“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue. This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side”, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters ahead of a two-day meeting of the alliance’s defence ministers in Brussels.“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack. But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution”, Mr Stoltenberg said, calling the current situation the “most serious security crisis we have faced in Europe for decades”.France has not yet verified whether Russia is pulling back some troops from Ukraine’s border but if the information is correct, this would be a “positive sign”, France’s government spokesman Gabriel Attal told journalists on Tuesday.German chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Moscow on Tuesday to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin in a high stakes mission to avert war.It comes as Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday called on the country’s people to fly flags and sing the national anthem in unison on February 16th, a date that some Western media say Russian could invade.Ukrainian government officials stressed that Zelenskiy was not predicting an attack on Wednesday, but responding skeptically to the foreign media reports.“They tell us February 16th will be the day of the attack. We will make it a day of unity,” Mr Zelenskiy said in a video address to the nation.“They are trying to frighten us by yet again naming a date for the start of military action,” Mr Zelenskiy said. “On that day, we will hang our national flags, wear yellow and blue banners, and show the whole world our unity.”Mr Zelenskiy has long said that, while he believes Russia is threatening to attack his country, the likelihood of an imminent invasion has been overstated by Western allies, responding to Moscow’s efforts to intimidate Ukraine and sow panic.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Mr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, told Reuters the president was responding in part “with irony” to media reports of the potential date of the invasion.Russian parliamentRussia’s lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to ask President Vladimir Putin to recognise two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent, the house speaker said.The move by the State Duma, if approved, could further inflame a wider standoff over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine that has fuelled Western fears that Moscow could attack. Russia denies any invasion plans and has accused the West of hysteria.Recognition of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics could kill off the Minsk peace process in east Ukraine, where a conflict between government forces and Moscow-backed separatists has killed 15,000 people.“Kyiv is not observing the Minsk agreements. Our citizens and compatriots who live in Donbass need our help and support,” Vyacheslav Volodin, the State Duma speaker, wrote on social media.Mr Volodin, a member of the pro-Putin ruling United Russia party, said the appeal would be sent to the Kremlin immediately. It was not clear how long the Kremlin would take to review it.Moscow casts the conflict in east Ukraine as a civil war, but Ukraine and the West say Russia helps the separatists with its own ground forces, something Moscow denies.Russia has issued more than 700,000 passports to residents of eastern Ukraine since separatists seized territory there in 2014 shortly after Russia annexed Crimea, souring relations with Kyiv and the West.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the substance of the appeal, saying that no decision had been taken on it. But he added that the pro-Russian separatist region known as Donbass was a matter of great concern for Russians.He said that Russia had repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to the Minsk peace process and that it still wanted it to be implemented.Four-way east Ukraine peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany were held last week but ended without a breakthrough.After the talks, Ukraine said it would not yield to pressure from Moscow to negotiate directly with the separatists, while Russia accused Kyiv of putting forward absurd proposals. – Additional reporting ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden right covid along","story":"To understand Sweden, you need to understand a word that’s hard to explain, let alone translate: lagom. It means, in effect, “perfect-simple”: not too much, not too little. People who are lagom don’t stand out or make a fuss: they blend right in – and this is seen as a virtue. Essays are written about why lagom sums up a certain Swedish mindset – that it’s bad to stand out, to consider yourself better or be an outlier. That’s why it’s so strange that, during the lockdowns, Sweden became the world’s defiant outlier.Swedes saw it the other way around. They were keeping calm and carrying on: lockdown was an extreme, draconian, untested experiment. Lock up everyone, keep children out of school, suspend civil liberties, send police after people walking their dogs – and call this “caution”? Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, never spoke about a Swedish “experiment”. He said all along he could not recommend a public health intervention that had never been proven.Tegnell also made another point: that he didn’t claim to be right. It would take years, he’d argue, to see who had jumped the right way. His calculation was that, on a whole-society basis, the collateral damage of lockdowns would outweigh what good they do. But you’d only know if this was so after a few years. You’d have to look at cancer diagnosis, hospital waiting lists, educational damage and, yes, count the Covid dead. Almost two years on, we can look at the early indications.The problem with lockdowns is that no one looks at whole-society pictures. Professor Neil Ferguson’s team from Imperial College London admitted this, once, as a breezy aside. “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression,” they wrote in a supposed assessment of lockdown, “which will be high.” But just how high? And were they a price worth paying?As Sweden abolishes all domestic Covid restrictions, it emerges with one of Europe’s lower Covid death tolls: the rate is 1,614 per million people, just over half the amount of Britain (2,335). Given that our death tolls were comparable at first (both among the worst anywhere), it’s hard to argue that there’s some demographic force which meant Covid was never going to spread in Sweden. Nor is it possible to argue that Sweden was some hedonistic party-nation: its people were incredibly cautious. But unlike Brits, they had a government that trusted them.There were some Swedish diktats: a “rule of eight” was set up for a while. Bars, restaurants and cafes were all socially distanced and, at one point, had to close by 8.30pm. For a few weeks, Swedes even had vaccine passports. But that was about it: the rest was guidance, and it was followed.What no statistic can convey is just how careful Swedes were something that struck me whenever I’d visit. It was perfectly legal to meet up in bars and for a fika in a coffee shop, but most didn’t. A friend of mine had a rule that she’d only ever meet friends outside – even in the Stockholm winter (she did this so much that she got frostbite). In summer last year, studies showed Swedes working from home more than in any other European country.This kept Covid low, while the lack of rules allowed for people to use their judgement while minimising economic and social damage. Sweden’s GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 2020, while Britain’s collapsed by 9.4 per cent. Both have bounded back, but Sweden’s economy is this year expected to be five per cent larger than before the pandemic, versus two per cent for Germany. The UK will be about one per cent, one of the lowest figures in Europe. The cost of the various Covid measures is best summed up by the debt mountain: an extra £8,400 per head in Britain, and £3,000 in Sweden.Swedish schools kept going throughout, with no face masks. Sixth-formers and undergraduates switched to home learning, but the rest of Swedish children went to school as normal. That’s not to say there weren’t absences as the virus spread: it was common to see a third, at times even half of the class absent due to sniffles or suspected Covid. But there were no full-scale closures and, aside from some suspicions about minor grade inflation (the average maths grade sneaked up to 10.1, from 9.3), there is no talk in Sweden about educational devastation.In Britain, there is calamity and cover-up. By doling out more A grades than ever before – and telling universities to make more space – young people could be shovelled through the system with lost ground never recognised or quite made up.Grade inflation was staggering: the number of A-level students marked at A or A* jumped to 45 per cent, up from 26 per cent pre-pandemic, but no one doubts that these students learned far less. By some measures, educational inequality has been set back 10 years. But some problems are too big to admit.Academics suggest the effect of lost education is permanent: less education inevitably means lower salaries and slower career progression. The Institute for Fiscal Studies talks about £40,000 of lost lifetime earnings per pupil in Britain, £350 billion in all. Swedish studies estimate that Covid’s impact (on absenteeism and home-learning) could mean an £800 million overall hit – far smaller than the impact on Britain’s lost school days.The impact on hospital waiting lists is also very different. Fear of a virus keeps people away – at the peak of the first wave, attendance at Swedish A\u0026ampE was 31 per cent lower than normal in Britain, it collapsed by 57 per cent. Routine operations were down by 20 per cent in Sweden and 34 per cent in England, so waiting lists grew in both countries. As they did pretty much world over.But no country, anywhere, has had a waiting list grow as big as Britain’s: from 4.4 million pre-pandemic, it will keep getting worse for two years and peak at about 9.2 million, according to NHS modelling – that’s equivalent to one in five adults. A top-down health service is more easily disrupted if it’s ordered to transform into a Covid service (and people are told to “protect the NHS” by not using it). Sweden’s waiting lists, 130,000 pre-pandemic, hit 170,000 last October. Even adjusting for population, it’s nowhere near the size of Britain’s problem.Sweden will not declare victory. No one was properly prepared for Covid, and The country’s failure to protect care home residents is still seen as a national scandal. Sweden also took a bigger hit than its neighbours: Denmark, which did lock down, has more to shout about when it comes to combining a lower Covid hit with minimal economic disruption. But, as Tegnell would say, it’s still too early to say – with any finality – who got it right and who didn’t.More from NewsBanning gendered terms such as Sir and Miss ‘completely unnecessary’ says Department for EducationRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs absurd attempt prove belongs us exposes vanity","story":"Somebody in the BBC hierarchy must have thought this was a great idea. And quite a lot of people inside the organisation must have agreed – given the innumerable committee meetings that it would have passed through to gain approval.Having seen the overwhelming triumph of the campaign to protect the NHS by presenting it as a national institution that belongs to all of us, the Corporation has now launched an embarrassingly desperate public relations onslaught with precisely the same theme.It is, believe it or not, “your BBC” – even when it righteously screens out what it regards as your unacceptable views, or imposes its particular version of social virtue on the nation, or refuses to apologise for what you may see as an offensive anti-Semitic slur.The clumsily worded slogan – “The BBC is something that belongs to all of us” (something? what exactly?) – is apparently to become a ubiquitous refrain in its endless self-promotion, but if you want the full length version, you can view a video on iPlayer entitled This is our BBC.This opus is obviously designed to be hilarious, proffering the subtext “we don’t really take ourselves too seriously” when, in fact, what it reveals is that the BBC sees itself as a sacrosanct mainstay of British identity.Whatever you may have been tempted to conclude, it insists, we are not an out-of-touch, self-regarding purveyor of our own particular worldview which regards much public opinion as beneath contempt.Listen to what we are saying now about how we view ourselves and, above all, be aware that we cannot carry out this mission without your participation.That somebody – indeed, lots of people – within the organisation felt that this absurd exercise was appropriate tells you something about the state of mind at Broadcasting House.The Corporation has reacted to the threat to its future and its antiquated funding model in precisely the wrong way. Instead of listening with a semblance of respect to the criticisms made of its attitude and judgment, it has become more arrogant and aggressive.In its news and current affairs programming, it has become more insular and enclosed. What passes for discussion on the news consists of a BBC presenter interviewing a BBC correspondent who repeats a pre-scripted version of what the presenter has just provided.Instead of opening itself up to genuine arguments or to alternative opinions that are enlivening public discourse in the real world, it shuts down any possibility of disagreement. The result is predictable, anodyne and anti-democratic.In much of what should be apolitical programming – entertainment and lifestyle genres – it inserts themes and directives which clearly have a political intent and treats any public resistance to this as a form of heresy.Who do they think they are fooling?

They were her most prized possessions.“He was a lovely man who was proud that he joined up with the war effort. He was brilliant.”Gregory was born in 1913 in Hartlepool, County Durham, and worked as a plasterer before joining the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1938.He had a number of brushes with death, including over Dunkirk in May 1940, when a Luftwaffe bullet entered the aircraft only to be stopped by his luckily placed cigarette case.Later, he was shot down over Liverpool by friendly fire while intercepting a bombing raid. He bailed out at 16,000ft, landing on the roof of Lime Street Station, where passengers “roughed him up” having mistaken him for a German.In May 1944, he had to ditch his Mosquito 70 miles off the Norfolk coast after being hit by a German Messerschmitt Bf 109.Despite those many close calls, Gregory survived the war and only retired from the RAF in 1964. He died aged 87 in 2001.He flew more than 100 operational sorties and shot down 23 German aircraft during the war.Speaking of the medals, antique expert Mark Smith said: “They are some of the highest gallantry awards the country can give you and he has so many. They are spectacular.“He was one of the people who saved the country in 1940 without any shadow of a doubt, and this group is worth £100,000.“It doesn’t matter about their value, it’s about what it means to the country.”It’s unknown if the family plans to sell them.More from NewsRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown debate skewed sceptical scientists shunned social media","story":"Anti-lockdown scientists were viewed as having ‘fringe’ ideas because those calling for draconian restrictions had more followers on social media, a study has shown.Professor John Ioannidis, of Stanford University, an expert in data science and the reliability of research, studied the expertise of authors who signed the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) compared with signatories of the John Snow Memorandum.The GBD called for vulnerable people to be shielded while allowing immunity to build up in the rest of the public to avoid huge costs to society, education and public health.In contrast, the John Snow Memorandum (JSM) argued that such a policy of herd immunity was unethical.Prof Ioannidis said he wanted to examine the prevailing narrative that the Great Barrington Declaration was a minority view among experts, and found that Twitter firepower had helped shape the conversation.In an article published in BMJ Open Research, he found that both letters were authored by very influential experts, but that the John Snow Memorandum authors had a far greater reach on social media, which made it appear that their view had more support.By November 2021, just four key signatories of the GBD had more than 50,000 Twitter followers, compared with 13 of the key authors of the JSM.Prof Ioannidis concluded: “Both the Great Barrington Declaration and John Snow Memorandum include many stellar scientists, but JSM has far more powerful social media presence and this may have shaped the impression that it is the dominant narrative.“GBD is clearly not a fringe minority report compared with JSM, as many social media and media allude.“If knowledgeable scientists can have a strong social media presence, massively communicating accurate information to followers, the effect may be highly beneficial.“Conversely, if scientists themselves are affected by the same problems (misinformation, animosity, loss of decorum and disinhibition, among others) when they communicate in social media, the consequences may be negative.”Prof Ioannidis also said signatories of the JSM had contributed to the vilification of authors of the GBD through their tweets and op-eds.Angus Dalgleish, professor of oncology at St George\u0027s, University of London, who was one of the GBD signatories, said: “I am not at all surprised at this.“Of course it is a problem that should not be.

If further resources are needed to keep our country safe, it is essential that they are provided as a matter of urgency.”The new details on the security service’s stretched resources formed part of previously secret evidence that was heard behind closed doors last year on the grounds of national security. On Tuesday, a gist of the secret evidence was made public.The inquiry has previously heard how MI5 was passed two pieces of intelligence in the months leading up to the bombing that were initially assessed as being “non-nefarious”, but later transpired to be “highly relevant” to the planned attack.This gist revealed that one of the MI5 agents responsible for assessing the intelligence admitted that it could have been understood at the time to “indicate activity of pressing national security concern”.The inquiry also heard that Abedi had talked about killing people “in a public space” for years but nobody took it seriously. A prison officer, known only as PO1 for legal reasons, told the inquiry that he spoke with Abedi’s friend and convicted terrorist Abdalraouf Abdallah – known as Abs – in December last year in his cell. During the five-minute conversation, PO1 sat on Abdallah’s bed as he told him that the terror atrocity was done by “one of his boys” and that Abedi had talked to friends and family for years about harming others but everyone thought “he would never go through with it”.In a police statement made after the conversation, PO1 said: “Abs said for years the lad had said about killing people in a public space but all this lad’s friends and family had shrugged it off as just bravado, it had been said that often.”Abdallah was jailed in 2016 for helping four men from Manchester travel to Syria where three of them fought for the so-called Islamic State.Abedi twice visited him in jail, the second time just months before the arena bombing, and the pair used a smuggled mobile phone to exchange thousands of messages, including discussing “martyrdom”.Abdallah, a paraplegic who was injured fighting against Gaddafi forces in the 2011 Libya uprising, has denied any involvement or knowledge of the arena attack.The public inquiry has now adjourned until a later date after the final day of evidence on Tuesday.More from NewsRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed hrt may prevent dying covid","story":"Hormone replacement therapy may protect older women from dying of Covid, a study suggests.Swedish and Finnish researchers at the University of Umea and the U1niversity of Helsinki, studied the records of 14,685 women aged between 50 and 80 who contracted coronavirus between February and September 2020.They found that women taking HRT were 54 per cent less likely to have died from their infection than those who were not using oestrogen supplementation.They also discovered that breast cancer sufferers who were taking drugs to help control their disease by suppressing oestrogen had more than double the risk of death.Around one in 10 women (10.1 per cent) on oestrogen suppressing drugs died during the study period compared with about one in 50 (2.1 per cent) of women on HRT and one in 20 (4.6 per cent) for the control group.The link with oestrogen may also explain why fewer women have died during the pandemic than men, the researchers said, suggesting the hormone has a protective effect.In a paper published in BMJ open, the authors conclude: “This study shows an association between oestrogen levels and Covid-19 death.“Consequently, drugs increasing oestrogen levels may have a role in therapeutic efforts to alleviate Covid-19 severity in postmenopausal women and could be studied in randomised control trials.”Even after accounting for potentially influential factors, such as age, annual disposable income, educational attainment and existing health conditions, the odds of dying from Covid-19 remained significantly lower (53 per cent) for women on HRT.However, British experts urged women to be cautious before turning to HRT to protect them from Covid-19.Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The findings are apparently dramatic. However, it must be remembered that there is a long history of observational studies, especially in relation to hormone therapy, making dramatic claims of benefits that have not been confirmed in randomised trials.“There are short-term benefits of hormone therapy but women should not, based on this or other observational studies, be advised to take hormone therapy for a supposed benefit on death from Covid-19.”Researchers also found that age was significantly associated with the risk of dying from the virus, with each extra year associated with 15 per cent greater odds, while every additional coexisting condition increased the odds of death by 13 per cent.Those with the lowest household incomes were nearly three times as likely to die as those with the highest.More from NewsRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian withdrawal may sign vladimir putin thinks has already","story":"Vladimir Putin wrongfooted the world again on Tuesday with the surprise announcement Russia is withdrawing some of its troops from around Ukraine.The question facing the West now is whether the move is a sign the crisis is abating — or just another tactical manouvre on the part of the Kremlin.On the face of it, the announcement appears to fit the view that the presence of the troops has always been a bluff on Mr Putin’s part.“February 15, 2022, will go down in history as the day when Western war propaganda failed,” a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman crowed on Tuesday. “They were humiliated and defeated without a single shot.”The taunt was directed at US predictions Russia would invade on Wednesday, but it may have contained a deeper message.Mr Putin has every reason to believe he has secured a major strategic victory without going to war.He has reasserted Russia as a superpower, brought Western leaders scurrying to meet with him in Moscow and left the whole world hanging on his next move.He appeared to give the game away with Monday\u0027s weird staged meeting for the television cameras, in which his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, reported back that the chances of a diplomatic solution were “far from exhausted” and Russia should keep going.Indeed, Mr Putin has been transparent about this tactic for months. In November he told Russian diplomats “tensions” with the West were a good thing and that it was “important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible.”But the question is: why stop now? Perhaps, like an experienced gambler, Mr Putin just wants to quite while he is ahead. But the timing seems odd.Only a day ago he seemed on the verge of an even bigger win, after the Ukrainian ambassador to Britain suggested his country could be ready to abandon its ambitions of Nato membership to avoid war, only for Kyiv to slap him down.That was Mr Putin’s central demand, yet now he appears to be backing down just when it is within reach.One possibility is that negotiations are taking place than we don\u0027t know about. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany made an intriguing comment on Tuesday when he called for Olaf Scholz to “bang with his first, but maybe also with his shoe if necessary” on Mr Putin’s table during his visit to Moscow.It was an odd remark that seemed designed to call to mind Nikita Kruschchev, who famously banged his shoe on a desk at the United Nations, and who was Soviet leader during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the moment the US and the Soviets came closest to war.The Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved with a secret deal agreed via back channel negotiations led by Robert F Kennedy.It is possible there are talks being conducted through similar back channels of which we know nothing today.It is worth noting that Boris Johnson and Joe Biden said there was still hope for a diplomatic solution on Monday night, just ahead of Russia’s announcement it was pulling troops back.But it is important to be cautious about reading too much into Russia’s announcement.“All warfare is based on deception,” Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War. “When using our forces, we must appear inactive when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”Far from being a sign that the crisis is over, a Russian withdrawal could be a classic feint. Mr Putin could be laying the ground to claim he was pulling his forces out when he was forced into action against his will.It is a little too soon to declare the crisis over yet.Sign-up to our Russia-Ukraine crisis webinar and chat to  journalists on Wednesday February 16 at middayMore from NewsRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists solve 5000 year old cold case testing stone age skeleton","story":"British scientists have cracked a 5,000-year-old cold case by testing for algae in the bone marrow of a Stone Age skeleton.Experts from the University of Southampton applied the technique to the man who was found in a mass grave on the Chilean coast, but whose cause of death remained a mystery.They hope that the technique can be used on historic coastal mass graves across the world. Prof James Goff of the University of Southampton, who led the study, said: “Mass burials have often been necessary after natural disasters such as tsunamis, floods or large storms.“However, we know very little about whether prehistoric mass burial sites near coastlines could be the result of natural disasters or other causes such as war, famine and disease.“This gave us our light bulb moment of developing an enhanced version of a modern forensic test to use on ancient bones.”The Chilean man, it turned out, was not the victim of a natural disaster or major catastrophe. Test results found a variety of marine particles which suggested he drowned in saltwater, which included fossilised algae, parasite eggs and sediment.Others in the mass grave, meanwhile, did not have the same markers, suggesting that they did not drown and that this was an isolated incident.Further evidence, including the condition of the inidual’s bones which showed signs of frequent harpooning, rowing and harvesting of shellfish, and his age of between 35 and 45, suggested that he was a fisherman.He was also likely to have drowned in shallow water, said Prof Goff.“We could see that the poor man swallowed sediment in his final moments and sediment does not tend to float around in sufficient concentrations in deeper waters.”Modern forensics can confirm drowning as the cause of death in recent victims by testing for diatoms - a group of algae found in oceans, freshwater and soils - inside the bones of the victims.If diatoms are discovered in the bones of victims’ bodies, it is likely that they drowned because, had they died before entering the water, they would not have swallowed any.The test had, until now, never been successfully used to conclude drowning in prehistoric human remains.More from NewsRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccination strategy leaving british families grounded","story":"After mostly staying in Britain for holidays during the pandemic, including a chilly spell in Cornwall last year, Hannah Hope had thought this February half-term might have been her family’s chance to jet off. And so it could have been – were it not for the complicated patchwork of travel rules governing entry to foreign destinations, many of which now require children to be jabbed. If you live abroad, this is perhaps not a problem. The European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds last May, and for children aged five to 11 in November. The US Food and Drug Administration also authorised the Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-olds in May, and for five to 11-year-olds in October.But in Britain, where the vaccine rollout for 12 to 15-year-olds started in late September, almost half of that age group are yet to receive their first jab. And children aged five to 11 are still awaiting a rule change that would enable them to be vaccinated – despite countries such as Germany, Spain, Denmark and Greece making vaccines available to this age group at the end of last year. Here in the UK, messaging around children and vaccines has been branded “abysmal”, while parents have been left confused and frustrated.As a result of these delays, longed-for foreign holidays have been scuppered for many British families, and Hope is among those who have struggled to book a getaway abroad. It was November when the vaccine was given to pupils at her children’s secondary school. But her 13-year-old son had tested positive for Covid in October. This meant he was unable to have his first jab until January, and won’t be eligible for his second until mid-April. His 15-year-old brother, having received his first jab in December, then caught Covid a few weeks later, so must wait until May for his second one. “We were looking to go away for a few days in Europe, but currently nowhere will let us in, apart from possibly Portugal or Denmark,” says Hope, 46, a nutritionist from St Albans. “Even a trip to Spain is out as they want a PCR test and, due to recent infection, we won’t have a clear PCR in time.”So instead, they are off to the Peak District this week. “I just wanted to get a few days away, but it’s very difficult to know where we can go. This half-term was a write-off because I didn’t know what we could do.”This is a problem for many parents in a similar position. Although Spain has just dropped its requirement for teenagers to be fully jabbed, this came too late for the many families who had already had to cancel half-term trips. In the current chaotic situation, it may seem safer to wait until the last minute to see what the latest rules are before booking an overseas holiday. But soaring prices make that prohibitive. Yet booking ahead can feel risky – not least for parents of children under 12 who don’t yet know if, or how quickly, their children might be jabbed, and whether it will be required for entry to certain countries later this year. It is already the case that to enter Israel, children aged one and over must be either fully vaccinated or recovered from Covid.“I’m hoping to go to Israel in May for my brother’s wedding, but at the moment we can’t get my nine-year-old daughter there,” says Debbie Marks, who is among those affected by the UK’s ergence from other countries when it comes to vaccinating children.So why has Britain – which had a head start in jabbing adults – been lagging behind with its rollout of the vaccine to under-16s? In early September, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said it was not recommending the vaccination of healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, amid fears of a rare side effect of heart inflammation. They wanted more information before giving the green light to jabs for teenagers. The rollout to secondary school pupils did start later that month, but has made sluggish progress. In part, this slow uptake has been blamed on logistical difficulties but also, according to Professor Christina Pagel, the director of University College London’s clinical operational research unit, on a lack of clear messaging from bodies including the JCVI, the Cabinet and the chief medical officers.Now, following months of uncertainty, new advice on vaccinating five to 11-year-olds is expected imminently, suggesting parents should be given the option of having their young children vaccinated, on the grounds this could prevent a small number of hospital admissions. But the Government’s scientific advisers are understood to have agreed the jabs should be made available on a “non-urgent” basis. This follows a protracted period of wrangling, with the JCVI having been ided over whether the benefits are great enough to justify the rollout to healthy primary-aged pupils. “It is a mystery to me why the UK has been so slow to offer a vaccine for children aged five to 11,” says Dr Simon Williams, a lecturer in psychology at Swansea University, who recently authored an article in the British Medical Journal headlined: “The UK is an international outlier in its approach to Covid in children.” He believes the delay is “hard to justify”, adding: “So many regulatory authorities globally have approved or even officially recommended the vaccine in this age group, including the United States’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organisation. The UK was in a fortunate position of having early access to vaccines, and relatively high uptake among adults, and yet it has been slow both to initially offer the vaccine for children aged 12 and above, and now to children aged five to 11.”He says there is a lack of clarity as to why it has not yet been made available – and if and when it will be – by the UK Government to all children in this age group. “Overall, the pandemic is going in the right direction in the UK and there is much to be optimistic about. However, this is masking the trends in schools and schoolchildren where rates are still very high – with recent Office for National Statistics data showing one in nine younger children testing positive.”Indeed, one argument for vaccinating young children has centred on the need to reduce the disruption the virus continues to cause to their education and social lives. Others suggest we are now past the point where jabs would make a difference to primary schoolchildren, with most having already had Covid. There are also concerns over the ethics of vaccinating children against a disease that is highly unlikely to make them severely ill, if the main reason would be to protect society as a whole.But Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary, University of London, suggests the UK’s delay in vaccinating younger children “certainly doesn’t seem evidence-based”. She says: “Millions of children this age across the globe have been vaccinated with no issue, and it’s very clear that vaccination protects against severe illness in children. We’ve seen some of the highest rates of infection, absenteeism due to Covid-19, self-reported long Covid and hospitalisation among children in the past few weeks. “The complacency around childhood vaccination in the UK is astonishing given how rapidly adult vaccination and booster programmes were carried out.”More from NewsRussia crisis: Ukraine joining Nato \u0026#39not on the agenda\u0026#39, says German chancellorPictured: Storms send 300ft Welsh wind turbine crashing to groundLockdown debate skewed because sceptical scientists were shunned on social mediaGCSEs and A-levels: What you need to know about how exams are changing in 2022Prince William sets up \u0026#39life-changing\u0026#39 meeting between grieving boy and his footballing hero after bonding over losing their mothersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joining union vital workers feeling","story":"Joining a union is vital for workers feeling cost-of-living pinch, says Angela RaynerBritish workers pay packets are not stretching far enough, despite them working harder than ever. Thats why its important to join a trade union to protect yourself at work, writes Labours Deputy Leader Angela RaynerA wasted decade of low growth in our economy under the Conservatives has unsurprisingly come alongside a decade of stagnant pay Image: NurPhoto PA ImagesopinionByAngela Rayner:,  Feb |commentsWe have a serious issue right now in Britain.There is an inflation crisis created in Downing Street that is driving up the cost of utility bills, food, petrol, transport and everyday necessities. Almost daily, I hear from my constituents in Ashton-under-Lyne quite how seriously they are feeling the pinch. Their pay packets are just not stretching far enough. These people range from care workers to young city types, from nurses to supermarket staff, and they all tell me that while they work harder than ever, they are struggling more to make ends meet. We know Brits have needed a pay rise for a very long time, after a decade of wage stagnation and the rise of new insecure forms of work people are left struggling. I know that is not good enough for the families in Ashton-under-Lyne, or families anywhere in Britain.Trade Unions exist to collectively empower workers - and it is that goal that took the Labour Party to Parliament. The Labour Party’s links with the Trade Unions aren’t just historic, they are more relevant than ever in these precarious times for British workers and their families.When people need decent pay to keep afloat, flexibility to manage their family le, and the confidence to challenge inequality, Trade Unions are more important than ever. I know that working families are the backbone of our economic growth. A wasted decade of low growth in our economy under the Conservatives has unsurprisingly come alongside a decade of stagnant pay. They have chosen to become the party of high taxes because they are the party of low growth.I also know that despite the barriers the Conservatives have put in the way, good employers and businesses already work closely with Trade Unions because they care about their workers. When I was a Trade Union representative, we only saw victories because businesses understood they needed happy and healthy staff. But those workplaces where people are overworked, unable to switch off, or are paid poverty wages cannot be left unchecked. It is when we come together that we are strongest and achieve the most. Security at work, prosperity in decent pay, and all workers treated with respect. That is Labouraposs New Deal for Working People and the driving mission of the Labour movement. Almost every workplace will have a Trade Union you can join.

Race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust was granted the declaration by Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt after a High Court hearing in December. The Good Law Project joined the Runnymede Trust in the action. The judges ruled that the Runnymede Trust had sufficient standing to bring a public sector equality duty challenge but GLP did not.The ruling centred on Mr Hancockaposs decision to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August  and ex-Sainsburyaposs boss Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHS Test and Trace in September . Lawyers representing the two organisations suggested that people outside the tight circle in which senior Conservative politicians and their friends moved were not being given opportunities. They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the judgement aposthe claim brought by Good Law Project fails in its entiretyapos, therefore highlighting the fact this group continues to waste the courtaposs time. He said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. He said: They accept these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of time. Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives.

Boris Johnson will chair an emergency COBR meeting today after he cut short a UK tour to deal with the Ukraine crisis. The Prime Minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Monday night, when both leaders agreed there was a crucial window for diplomacy but the threat of Russian aggression remained serious.More than , Russian troops are massed on the Ukrainian borders. But some units started toto their bases on Tuesday morning, offering a glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution.  Ms Truss said Europe was teetering on the brink of war and time was running out to find a diplomatic solution. And she said the crisis could embolden other countries with military ambitions. The senior Tory told Sky News: If we saw an invasion into Ukraine, there would be severe costs in terms of a long-running conflict, we could see the undermining of security more broadly in Europe and could see other aggressors around the world see it as an opportunity to expand their ambitions too. This is a very dangerous moment for the world. Ms Truss said the stability of Europe was hanging in the balance. The big risk, of course, isthere is an invasion into Ukraine that will be hugely damaging for Russia and Ukraine. And it will further undermine the stability of Europe, she said. This, I fear, would not stop at Ukraine. This is an attack on the neighbouring states of Russia and other east European countries in trying to undermine legitimacy of them being part of NATO.  She said she was very worried about the situation, adding: We could be on the brink of a war in Europe, which would have severe consequences not just for the people of Russia and Ukraine, but also for the broader security of Europe. There is still time for Vladimir Putin to step away from the brink. But there is only a limited amount of time for him to do that. Mr Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have agreed to continue down the path of negotiations, prompting hopes that there could still be a way to avert war. A Downing Street source said there was some hope that diplomacy could work and Russia could step back.

He is good with other dogs and people. He hasnapost been cat tested.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.“Doru would love a home with a garden and can live with another dog for company.” He has been described as an “amazingly trusting and affectionate”, who has lots of energy and loves his walks. However, he can get nervous when walking in unfamiliar settings and would need to stay close to his owner on a lead. Doru’s foster family said: “He is not bothered by house noises and ignores cats, squirrels and ducks in the park. “He is quite quiet. He is very quick to learn and now sits and waits on command and has stopped snatching treats. He is gentle and playful with other dogs. “Doru has been known to jump on tables and kitchen surfaces still and is very ‘hungry’.  “He is clean in the house mostly but still needs monitoring. He can be restless in the evening. “All in all, he’s an absolute poppet. A dear little dog.” Blind Dog Rescue UK works to rehome blind and partially sighted dogs who have been subjected to the “worst of humanity yet still have an astonishing capacity to adapt, love and become perfect ambassadors for blind dogs everywhere”. Many of the dogs in their care have been victims of abuse, neglect, disease or trauma - and struggle to survive in shelters. A Blind Dog Rescue UK statement reads: “It is incredibly dficult for sighted dogs to survive anyof time in these shelters let alone blind or partially sighted dogs. “We need to get to these dogs quickly and secure their immediate release and treatment. “These dogs may have been deliberately blinded, involved in road traffic accidents or long term sufferers of painful conditions such as glaucoma. “They need veterinary care and to be given the safety and comfort of a foster home in which to start healing. “Here they are given love and affection and a warm bed - possibly the first they will have experienced in their letimes. At this point we are able to start assessing and promoting these wonderful dogs for forever homes.To adopt Doru, or find out more information about him, contact Blind Dog Rescue UK via their website www.bdruk.org.Do you have a story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsRescueAnimalsValentines DayLove\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

But because of her failure to abide by it, she now faces a day at Kirklees Magistratesapos Court next month. A witness statement from one resident says: The noise from the crowing cockerels has affected and continues to affect our daily le.  This is not just a single bird crowing occasionally, they said. Typically, once one starts other birds join in with almost continual crowing either simultaneously or consecutively.Depending on the season and weather we have had our sleep disturbed often as early as am or earlier, every day of the week including weekends.In addition, frequently the crowing would continue into the late evening. With such disturbance to our health has been affected as well as disturbing and spoiling any enjoyment we might have in being outside in our garden. More so in summer when doors and windows are typically open the noise also infiltrates the house. Almost three years ago, early , we started to be woken up in the early morning by the sound of cockerels crowing. As this carried on we discovered the birds were housed a short distance away. The birds are in a direct line to, and almost at the same height as our bedroom window, around m away. Over time the number of birds kept has been increased exacerbating the issue. We believe that at least six cockerels have been kept and possibly  or more since . It is almost three years since the problem started and our first complaint was made to Kirklees Council in . Jess, who has a background in animal welfare, said: I love these cockerels. I donapost have children so these animals are like my aposbabiesapos. Obviously, it is not nice when you are being woken up but this is a semi-rural area and I rent the land from a local farmer. I was mad when I found out there had been a complaint. I would have liked the person concerned to have come to me personally instead of complaining via the council. I have had anti-crow collars fitted to the cockerelsapos throats which tighten their passages and dull the sound and I think that has made a dference. I have done that on all of them but it works better on some of them than others. The council wants me to put them in a dark box but I think that is cruel.She has now set up a GoFundMe page outlining her plight and asking for people to help her raise hundreds of pounds so she can be defended by a solicitor in court.In it, she pleads: I myself suffer from anxiety, of which keeping my chickens, , helps massively with this. I donapost have children, they are my world. I love each and every one of my babies! I would be heartbrokenthey were made to be removed. Please help me with my fight to keep my boys!

But a Manchester University study has shown it’s a ­relatively small group of patients who have been piling on additional pressure at surgeries. These “frequent attenders” account for a large proportion of a GP’s ­workload – % of appointments, including ­face-to-face consultations. The findings go some way to explain why it’s so hard to see a GP. Frequent attenders – classed as people having more appointments than % of patients at their practice, have more than doubled their number of clinic visits in the last two decades. The study ran from - and looked at million consultations from .million patients in  ­GP practices. It showed four out of  patients were frequent attenders. Co-author Dr Maria Panagioti, from Manchester University, said: “Frequent attenders also may have special health and social care needs but for a iety of reasons we do not yet fully ­understand how best to meet them.”Consultations with GPs by frequent attenders increased from an average of  in  to  in . But when consultations with other staff at GP clinics, such as nurses, were added in, the average figure more than doubled from  to . To cope with more requests for appointments GPs are using a iety of means, including non-face-to-face, such as telephone and online. It seems the traditional way of patients seeing GPs is being replaced by a new working model where other staff members are using dferent ways simply to cope with workloads. Co-author Professor Evan ­Kontopantelis from Manchester University, said: “This is the first study to show that frequent attenders, the top % of consulters, have largely and progressively contributed to increased workload in general ­practices across the UK over the last  years.” Co-author Professor Aneez Esmail, also from Manchester University, said: “Our findings show frequent attenders account for an increasing proportion of face-to-face consultations with GPs and are responsible for nearly % of consultations fairly constantly over time.” Dr Panagioti added: “But these ­findings may also suggest the increase in multi-disciplinary staff working in general practices is perhaps the only solution for sustaining primary care. “Indeed, the large increase in the general practice workload over the last  years means having extended multidisciplinary teams is necessary to meet a wide range of patient needs through a range of ways such as remote consultations.” Sounds like general practice will never be the same.

The government hopes to announce that an end to all Covid restrictions, including the mandatory period required for self-isolating, will be in place by the end of February. Parliament is currently on recess, but the Prime Minister is due to announce his plan for living with Covid when MPsnext week on Monday, February . Another change, this time to testing, is also likely to be announced. Boris Johnson looks set to unveil the change that could impact Brits up to £ at a time, as the UK looks to learn to live with the virus.So what is the change and why will Brits be charged  Will PCR tests be scrapped  Free PCR tests now look set to be scrapped and could cost people £they want to get their hands on one. The Living Safely With Covid plan is due to be published on February  and may well include the plans to scrap free PCRs.  PCR tests have been vital to determinea person has Covid, as they are more accurate than lateral flow testsand have become a requirement for travel to and from certain countries around the world at ious points during the pandemic. The hope is that LFTs becoming more widely available will mean PCRs will not be so heavily relied upon. Why are free PCR tests set to be scrapped   The Treasury will be hoping to save billions by announcing the end to free tests. Covid figures have taken a downward trend recently. The seven-day average has been falling since January .  However, UK Health and Security Agencywants the government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April and some experts are also concerned that the changes will be taken as a signal by people with Covid that they should continue to mix in public setting, despite having clear symptoms of the virus. Will I have to pay for a PCRI am vulnerable  It is believed that PCR tests will remain free for those listed as vulnerable, as well as those in hospitals and in high-risk settings. Sources toldthat this will also include the . million eligible for antiviralsthey contract Covid. The government will outline the full details in the upcoming plan, but say there are no intentions to completely scrap community testing. A spokesperson added: Everyone can continue to get free tests and we are continuing to encourage people to use rapid tests when they need them. Record numbers of tests are being delivered to pharmacies, homes and those who need them. Testing continues to play an important role in helping people live their day to day lives, keep businesses running and keep young people in school.

Writing in the Sun, he said: At the moment, Meghan’s ultimate destination is unclear, but she certainly has the backing to make a bid to star as an American politician.In parallel, Britain is a lost cause for the Sussexes. In truth, I suspect Meghan no longer cares whether she is welcome in London. She has no intention of ing. However, he does point out that while public opinion about Meghan in the UK might not be favourable - in the US she is still admired.

In the video, which has been widely shared on social media, the gang of “ to ” kids and teenagers can be seen kicking and punching the girls as they lie on the ground screaming. A woman who witnessed the attack, by students from the Bishop Young Church of England Academy in Leeds, begged them to stop their assaut, shouting “leave her alone”.The gang of youths then turned on the bystander who said she ended up with some of the kids “on her” after she tried to intervene in the incident which took place near Arthur’s Rein Park in Leeds.The witness said the ambush involved over  students attacking the girls, who were reportedly thrown into a lake during the assault, Leeds Live reports. The witness described what she saw saying: “They were attacking her and another. I shouted ‘leave her alone’ and ‘what on earth are you doing ’ “I just saw around  to  kids coming towards me but I wasn’t bothered about me, just the young girls. I ended up with some of the kids on me.” She added that it didn’t last long. It has been reported that the girls were thrown in the lake during the assault and Bishop Young Academy has now issued a statement to parents about “poor behaviour happening on the way to or from school.”  The letter signed off by the headteacher Rachael Cole states: “Unfortunately, over the past few days, there have been some of incidents of poor behaviour happening on the way to and from school, and in the evening within our community. Although these incidents involve a very small minority of our students, they have had a negative impact on the local community and the reputation of our Academy. We are working very closely with parents, the police and the local community to address these issues and ensure that our students are responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to our society. “Please rest assured, that any time we receive information about the conduct of our students it is acted upon in the strictest possible terms, even when such behaviour occurs away from the academy. Should our students break the law, we actively encourage you to not only report it to us, but to also report it to the police and we will continue to work with the police to safeguard our students and our local community.” West Yorkshire Police have said they are making enquiries following the assault.They said: Police are making further enquiries following a report of an assault, which is said to have occurred in Dib Lane, Roundhay on  February. Anyone with information that will assist is asked to contact the East Leeds Neighbourhood Policing Team on , or by using the options on the West Yorkshire Police website.

Mum-of-three Kirsty Bortoft, from Scarborough, decided to make the move from Britain to a remote mountain in Spain, after years of suffering with severe anxiety and bad mental health. Kirsty was having regular panic attacks and said her mental health had been declining after a split from a “toxic” ex. So she decided to give up material possessions for the peace and quiet of the off-grid le. In , Kirsty was trying to juggle le as a single mum with three young children, a two and three-year-old, and a six-month-old toddler. Kirsty said: It was extremely hard breaking up with my partner, along with having next to no money.I went to the doctors and they were lovely, but theyaposre trained in drugs and pharmacology – a drug would numb it [my feelings] but I knew it wasnapost the answer. Then, after my appointment, I had this inner, small flickering of hope. In a moment akin to Eat Pray Love, the biography written by Elizabeth Gilbert,, Kirsty realised that she needed to find a new path. She was miserable in her office job and wanted to do something that would reignite her zest for le. The mum started by going on a free weekend course to become a le coach – which, in a roundabout way, would soon see her jet off on a journey to Spain. Kirsty said: During a class, I had this awakening where I realised that my le was like one big jigsaw puzzle but there was one piece missing. Iaposd been trying to aposfixapos myself on the outside for so long, when really, that one piece is where I need to fix myself on the inside. I needed to go on a massive, soul-searching journey.  Kirsty had become interested in mediation, and while researching her next step stumbled across the Ishayas Monks. The monks, who live in Reus in the Mont-Ral mountains, are dedicated to consciousness and aposmastery of the selfapos – the inward journey of aposletting goapos or surrender. Instead of GIlbertaposs Italy, India and Indonesia, the mum opted for a closer location – taking her children along for the ride. She said: I felt so drawn to what they were teaching to the point where I took my two youngest out of school and drove to Spain to study the working of the mind and the mastery of the self with a load of monks! It may sound like a crazy decision but my extended family were really supportive. Plus, it was great for my oldest kids, who were eight and  at the time, as there was a little school there and loads of opportunities for adventure. It sounds crazy but I wasnapost scared whatsoever.  Kirsty and her children shared a house with another family, and everyone followed a programme each day including sunrise yoga and meditation. There were three other families from the UK and Australia, and a school and pool for the children to learn and have fun. Kirsty said: Our children would be taught by monk teachers and go on incredible nature adventures while the adults learned their teachings. The house was beautul, fairly big and open and with incredible views over the mountain to the coast. The breakfast would be pretty normal with porridge and lunch would be salads, soups, cold soups, fruit and then dinners were more hearty. It was a very clean diet, so no alcohol, no rubbish and it was almost all organic. Kirsty remained with the monks for four years, in the end studying to become one herself.  She graduated as an Ishaya Monk in  and was christened as Rudra Devi – meaning The Goddess Who Removes Pain. Itaposs not about meditating  hours-a-day anymore, bald heads and big cloaks – itaposs a new modern way!” she said. Itaposs about bringing something back into the community and using it in real le and that was what really excited me about it. We were on top of mountains, surrounded by people who wanted to be more, still, present, loving, kind and helpful. It was the best experience. While in Spain, Kirsty had kept her house in the UK and once a fully-fledged monk, decided to head back home to share her wisdom with stressed-out Brits. Now a mindset coach too, she helps people suffering from anxiety and mental health-related issues using the techniques she learned while living with the Ishaya Monks. Moving back to England, I was so excited to tell everybody about it and teach but then I realised that not everyone was ready to hear it,” she said. I knew I needed to share what Iaposd learned with the world and after a while I started to get more and more clients, and now I work with people all over the UK. I believe and teach that we get so busy with stuff thataposs generally external to us such as what s, bills, work stress what-nots, that we get confused, worried, and donapost sleep because of them. Le is for thriving, not surviving, itaposs one short le and we need to find that part inside of us that really helps us through. Up until lockdowns happened due to Covid, Kirsty dedicated some time every summer to go back and visit the monks in Spain.

However, the organisation is often the subject of conspiracy theories developed by people who believe Freemasons secretly run the country or change the world for their own benefit. It is believed that the group conceals at least some of its rituals, customs, or activities from the public, but the most powerful Freemason in England and Wales is less of a secret.According to My London, the head of the lodge, who members refer to as the ‘Grand Master’, is none other than the Queen’s first cousin Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent.Having been appointed in June , Edward has been serving the lodge for almost  years, making him the longest-serving head.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up. Edward, , is the son of the Queen’s paternal uncle, Prince George. In other words, Edward’s father was the brother of Queen Elizabeth’s father King George VI. He became the Duke of Kent when he was just six years old after his father was killed in a plane crash in . He has been carrying out royal duties since the age of  - first by walking behind the coffin of his uncle King George in , and then by paying homage to the Queen on her coronation in . He has also been involved with over  charities, including the Freemasons, where much of his charity work revolves around war remembrance, technology, and the growth of British industry.Although Edward is the head of the United Grand Lodge of England, he is not the head of all Freemasons worldwide. There are around  million Freemasons around the world – , of them living in England and Wales. The Duke’s brother, Prince Michael of Kent, is also a Freemason and is Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons, and Provincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Middlesex. Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh was also a Freemason having been introduced to Freemasonry in  at the age of  by his Father-in-Law King George VI. Throughout his  years, he was associated with some  charities, either as president, patron or as an honorary member.The Prince supported charitable organisations in the fields of scientic and technological research and development, the encouragement of sport, the welfare of young people, conservation and the environment. Dr David Staples, chief executive of the United Grand Lodge of England , said: “Prince Philip was well known for his charity work, having been involved with numerous organisations. He was devoted to philanthropy and therefore the best way to celebrate his le is by supporting the charities that the Prince himself supported. “For us, this was an easy decision as Freemasonry’s core values are charity, integrity, respect and friendship. The Freemasons have been quietly getting on with making society and the lives of those less fortunate better for more than three centuries,” said Dr Staples.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

A statement released this afternoon confirmed they have reached an agreement away from the courtroom, and Andrew will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity. Royal author Penny Junor believes his royal relatives will be extremely glad heaposs avoided a public trial in the US. She said: Going to trial, it could have been very, very nasty.  It could have been embarrassing, humiliating, and it would have been huge fodder for the tabloid press. It could have really taken the shine off the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee year. “At last, he’s expressing some regret and some empathy for those girls. She said his  Newsnight interview had been “all about him” but that Andrew has “got it right now”. She added: “He’s got it right now, it took him a long time to get there but I think he’s got it right.” Askedthere is a way back to public royal le for Andrew, Ms Juror said: “I think it’s very, very unlikely.” Earlier this year the Monarch stripped her son of his royal titles and took back all  of his military affiliations, including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. She faced mounting pressure to act with a letter signed by more than  Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking her to strip him of his military appointments.At the time, a source told The Mirror he was shell-shocked by the decision. Todayaposs statement, which was included in a letter submitted to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, who has been overseeing the civil sex claim brought by Ms Giuffre, said: “Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out of court settlement. “The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre’s receipt of the settlement . Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights. “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. “It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenPenny JunorPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ukraine has signalled a preparedness to sideline or abandon a desire to join Nato. Sustaining talks, however strained, is better than the alternative.

Parking and cars are banned at any time in Sheerness, Kent, where the townaposs clock tower normally stands in an area impossible for traffic to access. Before it was pedestrianised, there were double yellow lines on the street that have gradually faded over time. Swale Council has defended the painting as refreshed, but has also conceded they are due to be removed anyway. Conservative Cllr Cameron Beart, who represents Queenborough and Halfway on Swale Council and Sheppey on Kent County Council, said they must be the most pointless double yellow lines ever. He added: They are an absolute eyesore and totally unnecessary in a pedestrianised part of the conservation area. They serve no purpose at all and should be removed.  Stephen Jackson, whose Jacksonwood Vintage Tea Rooms overlook that section of the High Street, was equally confused. He said: You could hardly see the old lines but thataposs not an excuse for repainting them, as they shouldnapost be there now. The old lines were probably there from before the benches were put in. Itaposs a complete waste of time. After carrying out the paint job, Swale Council confirmed the lines are now due to be removed.  A spokesperson said: The double yellow lines that were already at the clock tower were refreshed by our lining contractors who were working to repaint yellow lines in Broadway and the high street in Sheerness. We carry out regular lining and signage maintenance around Swale. These restrictions are now scheduled for removal. The clock tower is currently being renovated and is not expected tountil later this year.

Two low pressure systems were originally expected to bring spells of very strong winds and potentially snow between Wednesday and Saturday, but Brits could feel the impact of sooner than thought after forecasters moved forward the warning period.Storm Dudley, which carries a danger to le weather warning, will likely start and finish earlier than expected, according to the Met Office, ahead of Storm Eunice moving in, bringing strong winds and potentially some snow for parts of the country on Friday.Gusts of up to mph are set to batter the whole of the country due to a jet stream which was originally forecast to hit on Wednesday and Thursday under a yellow weather warning.  But this has now been upgraded to a more severe amber warning bringing le-threatening gales to parts of Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the north of England. Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said an active jet stream is driving low-pressure systems across the country, both of which are likely to cause some disruption.Winds are expected to be strongest on exposed coasts and hills of Scotland, with -mph possible further inland. This is applicable to southern and western Scotland, the north coast of Northern Ireland and northern England, where the strongest and most disruptive winds are expected.  Winds are expected to ease through Thursday afternoon and evening. The stormy conditions will barely have subsided before the next low pressure system, named Storm Eunice, will track across central areas of the UK. According to the Met Office, further impacts are expected from disruptive gale force winds - with - mph winds expected inland. Heavy rain is expected to come alongside the system as well and there is a potential for some signicant snowfall over hills in the Midlands and further north.National Highways Head of Road Safety Jeremy Phillips encouraged drivers to check the latest weather and travel conditions before setting off on journeys, and considertheir journey is necessary and can be delayed until conditions improve.“If you do intend to travel, then plan your journey and take extra care, allowing more time for your journey,” he said. “In high winds, there’s a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we’d advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down. “Drivers of other vehicles should be aware of sudden gusts of wind which can affect handling and braking, and give high-sided vehicles, caravans, and motorbikes plenty of space. In the event of persistent high winds we may need to close bridges to traffic for a period, so please be alert for warnings of closures and follow signed ersion routes.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Met OfficeSnowWeatherStorms\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brits could feel the impact of Storm Dudley sooner than thought after forecasters moved forward the warning period. The storm, which carries a danger to le weather warning, will likely start and finish earlier than expected, according to the Met Office.Gusts of up to mph are set to batter the whole of the country due to a jet stream which was originally forecast to hit on Wednesday and Thursday under a yellow weather warning.  But this has now been upgraded to a more severe amber warning bringing le-threatening gales to parts of Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the north of England. This is set to reduce to a yellow wind warning by Thursday - after which Storm Eunice will bring strong winds and potentially snow to parts of the country on Friday.  The Met Office said very strong and disruptive winds are expected for the area with the risk of fallen trees, power cuts and transport delays and cancellations. Weather experts are also warning of injuries and danger to le from large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads, sea fronts and homes. Yellow wind warnings are in place for the rest of Northern Ireland and northern England, central Scotland and the Midlands on Wednesday and Thursday. Storm Dudley is set to bluster its way southward with a yellow wind warning in place for southern Scotland and the rest of the UK. A Met Office spokesperson said: There is a small chance that flying debris will result in a danger to le, with fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down.  There is also a small risk of injury and danger to le from large waves along the coast. Residents are urged to secure loose items outdoors, shut doors and windows, park vehicles in a garage where possible, and stay indoors during the storm as much as possible. There are no UK weather warnings in place from Saturday onwards.

Ms Giuffre, previously Virginia Roberts, made the claim against Andrew for damages in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs friend, to have sex with the royal when she was , a minor under US law. Andrew denies the allegations against him. In a letter submitted to the United States District Court on Tuesday, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer David Boies wrote jointly with Andrewaposs lawyers to say that the parties had reached a settlement in principle.  When asked for comment on the settlement, Mr Boies said: I believe this event speaks for itself. Court documents show the Duke will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Andrew has also pledged to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. An attachment to the letter announcing the settlement gave brief details of the agreement between Andrew and Ms Giuffre but indicated the sum would not be disclosed.It read: Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out of court settlement. The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffreaposs receipt of the settlement . Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffreaposs character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.  It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents eight victims of Jeffrey Epstein, welcomed the settlement as a victory for Virginia Giuffre.  She wrote on Twitter: My statement on behalf of the  Jeffrey Epstein victims I represent: aposWe hail Virginiaaposs victory today. She has accomplished what no one  could: getting Prince Andrew to stop his nonsense and side with sexual abuse victims. We salute Virginiaaposs stunning courage.apos In January, the dukeaposs lawyers submitted  reasons why the case against him should be dismissed, saying he demanded a trial by jury. Mr Boies, said his client and legal team were looking forward to confronting the royal about his denials.

So, you can understand why one bride would want to show off her efforts after investing in a handwritten bespoke sign for her and her husbandaposs special day.However, all that excitement may have just come crashing down, after a number of naughty-minded internet users spotted a rather unfortunate error. The sign is written in beautul curled calligraphy, which unfortunately has made some of the words appear as though they say something entirely dferent.One Reddit user decided to share a photo of the sign on Redditaposs Wedding Shaming forum, alongside the caption: Be careful of your signage font... Mr Penis. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Yep, the unlucky couple, who on closer inspection appear to be called Ale and Denis, got more than they bargained for when the curly element of the letter D, unfortunately, appeared to look more like a P. The sign actually reads: Bienvenidos a la boda de Ale  Denis, which translated into English means, Welcome to the wedding of Ale  Denis, but that didnapost stop people sniggering over the unfortunate mishap. A few centimetres can make all the dference. Letaposs hope the couple was able to laugh about it, one Reddit user joked, while another added: Ale and Penis sounds like an extremely sketchy pub. I went to school with a Denis and our other friend would sneakily extend a line on the D down so it said penis before he turned in papers. He did it all the time lol, a third Reddit user reminisced. Fortunately, others pointed out that native Spanish speakers wouldnapost necessarily make the rude connection and we certainly hope that wasnapost the case on the happy coupleaposs big day.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Posting from her handle @mrsnicolekerr, Nicole explained that she sets a timer for  minutes a day and during that time she does as much decluttering or cleaning in one aposzoneapos or room as possible.The fly lady cleaning method consists of setting a timer for  minutes a day and doing as much decluttering or cleaning in one aposzoneapos or room as you can. In addition to that, the method also includes an hour of aposhome blessingapos which is time dedicated to bigger cleaning jobs, such as changing bedding, hoovering, taking the rubbish out or dusting.

One said that the full glass of Coors just fell off the table and it left him with goosebumps. Shocked Natasha, , was then left stunned when she watched it back on CCTV at the -year-old White Swan Inn, in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. The pint appears to suddenly plummet onto the ground despite no one being near it. It is feared the pub has been targeted by ghouls before. But Natasha thinks a former regular Chris Harris, , may have come back to haunt them this time and is behind the moving beer to play tricks on them.  Natasha said: There was quite a large group of people and I said aposYou are making quite a mess, whataposs all this beer on the floor apos And one of the boys said that wasnapost me. I was like aposYeah alright then not believing themapos and they were like aposI promise you that it just fell now, look at my goose pimples.apos One of the staff persuaded Natasha to check the CCTV footage to seethe lads were telling the truth. The security camera footage, filmed on February , shows a full pint glass sitting on a table as nearby customers sat chatting in their seats. Suddenly the glass topples off the table, despite none of the punters touching it.  Natasha recorded the CCTV footage and can be heard pointing out the blurry hand of a spirit around the pint and the candle fluttering uncontrollably on the table. She said: Looks like a hand pushed the pint off, the pint goes a bit fuzzy. One of our regulars recently died so we thought it might actually be him. She has been working at the pub for the past  years and says there have been several unusual sightings by staff and customers. She added: I have been working for  years and really havenapost seen things like this, I have heard things. All of the staff have heard things about the things going on in the pub for so many years.  I felt things like there were people walking past me when there was nobody there. Last Sunday, I moved out of the way of a dog but there was no dog in the pub on that day. One time when I closed the pub I made sure to lock all the windows shut but when I left I noticed that something had opened one of the top windows without anyone  being in the pub. Staff have felt like somebody has been watching them. The cleaner saw somebody near the toilet door but seconds later there was nobody there. The activities of the spirit in the pub have increased in the past two weeks, according to Natasha, and she believes it could be due to a clairvoyant evening due to be held at the pub. She said: It has been creepy for the last two weeks, normally nothing has been bothering us but we have a clairvoyant evening coming up. So I am just wonderingthey are coming out because of that. The pub used to be a police station before it was converted - and during its time as a police station housed hardcore prisoners inside. The cellar, which is like a curved road, contains the concrete beds where the prisoners used to sleep in the police station. Ms Magnan posted the CCTV footage of the pint being pushed on the pubaposs social media page. One viewer wrote: Always been a spooky pub.

The woman said: “My granny decided to cook and thought my auntie put that food there - and she used it up since it had been in there for some time. “She sliced up some ginger, garlic and all the usual Chinese sauces, served it with rice and some bok choy.” It wasn’t until the sisters paid their next visit when they realised what had happened. “When we went to visit, my auntie told my sister they ate the meat she left there because they thought it would go bad - and that it tasted kind of bland,” she added. “After some confusion, my sister remembered and that was the day my granny and auntie ate dog food.” It is unknown whether the pair admitted the truth to their grandma and auntie - or whether it has become a family secret. However, they have been reassured by other users who have confessed to similar things happening within their own households. One user admitted: “I ate puppy treats and role played as a dog when I was a kid.” While another user said: “My grandfather-in-law actually ate dog snacks.

Ellery Krut, from Roswell, Georgia, USA - who posts under the username @ellerycrouton - shared a video in which she showed the picture she took with her, which displayed a womanaposs perfect almond-shaped nails with a transparent base and thin navy blue accents at the very tip.

The woman then laughed as she showed the camera the result she had ended up with - featuring uneven and wonky blue lines that were a completely dferent shade to the ones in her reference photo. Ellery paid for the manicure, and people in the videoaposs comments couldnapost believe sheaposd actually parted with cash for the manicure fail. One person said: Oh my god, please tell me you didnapost pay for this. While another added: Oh no, girl, tell me you didnapost pay.  The womanaposs video has over . million views, and other commenters were quick to let her know that the design she picked out was never going to work on her nails because they are a dferent shape from the ones in her reference picture. Someone said: That design wonapost work on short nails, but the nail technician should have told you that. As someone  told her: I literally cannot imagine a good outcome with your nail , Iaposm sorry bestie. While a third pointed out: Iaposm so sorry this happened, but you shouldaposve known it would be bad because the shape in the picture is so dferent. But others simply revelled in the hilarity of Elleryaposs nail blunder, as they compared her disastrous artwork to something a child might draw with Crayola gel pens. One person joked: Very Crayola.

The couple, who have been together for  years, had spent the night at a nearby spa on the island, off West Cork, before setting out on a romantic morning stroll along the clftop, CorkBeo reports.When they came across the beach, the woman was shocked to see the personalised message which read will you marry me my Mags Cleary  etched into the sand. Passersby were touched to see the heartwarming display of affection which also included a giant heart shape pierced by Cupidaposs arrow.  Mags, from North Cork, told CorkBeo: I certainly wasnapost expecting to see a proposal on the beach when we were out walking the next morning. I did get a bit of a shock. The couple, who are parents to Daryl, nine, and Robyn, seven, had been enjoying a rare romantic break. And Mags had been expecting some sort of development on the wedding front. She said: I thought something was up when we were going away, but I thought it might have been when we arrived at the hotel or over the meal that night.  Patrickaposs nephew helped formulate the romantic proposal by finding a local artist to sketch out the love message in the sand early in the morning at low tide. Mags said she appreciated the effort that went in to making it a very special Valentineaposs Day. She said: Weaposve been together  years so I suppose he had to do something dramatic. Heaposs certainly good with surprises. The engaged Mags told how her hubby-to-be got down on one knee but did not have the ring with him at the time. He knew there was no point as Iaposd probably want to pick out another one so we went into Killarney yesterday and got one, she added. The couple have not made and firm plans yet for the wedding but said it is a day that their children will certainly be looking forward to.

The North Korean dictator is said to have made the decision after he was told the aposKimjongiliaapos Begonias - a flower named after his late father Kim Jong-il - would not be ready in time for the former leaderaposs birthday.The flowers were meant to be a centrepiece for a huge celebration tomorrow - which is marked as the Day of the Shining Star.

However, due to a reported lack of firewood, this wasnapost possible and they failed to bloom in time. The gardeners have allegedly been accused of neglecting the flowers.A source told Daily NK News: Economic activity greatly decreased due to the strengthening of the countryaposs emergency disease-control measures, which led many Kimilsungia-Kimjongilia greenhouses to become neglected. But now theyaposre suddenly saying that the Kimjongilia flowers have to be grown in time for the event, so how is Han supposed to grow them  The source went on: Other employees have been punished. A flower grower surnamed Kim [in her s] was called in every day to the county party committee to report on the state of the flowers and to write self-criticism reports. Another man only known as Choi was said to be in charge of the boilers and was allegedly sentenced to three months in the labour camps for not properly setting the temperature. It is not the first time there have been dficulties growing the flowers - and they have previously been imported from China as a result.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

wanted to just go there with everything, you know, all the i’s dotted and t’s crossed and go and enjoy it and see where we end up.”McGuinness, from Morecambe, Lancashire, added that riders were “a little bit nervous” about the race following a break during the pandemic.He said: “Getting back to racing, we’re all a little bit nervous, all us riders especially.“We did some racing through Covid but not the road racing like in the Isle of Man so we’ve all been away for two years.“The bikes are getting faster, none of us have been there so we’re all nervous, there’s a lot of anticipation but, you watch, once we get there it will be flat out, it will be mph, we’ll be doing what we do but, you know, it’s leading up to my  starts – my century of starts – I’ll be  years old, which is probably one of the oldest on the grid, it’s  years of anniversary of the Honda Fireblade, which I ride, so there’s loads of little boxes being ticked.”The racer attended the ceremony with his we Becky and said collecting the MBE from the Princess Royal was “the icing on the cake” of his career.He said: “I’m really pleased, proud of it really, family’s proud, kids are proud, can’t wait to get home and

But, of course, they have to balance that against the prospect of missing school.“We have to consider very dferent issues when it comes to the vaccination of children as young as five years old, of course, so we’ll be in a position where we will expect those children to be accompanied by an adult.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match. Tomorrowthey face the same opponents, Finnart, at Kintyre Park, after their postponed fixture in early December.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges.CAPTION:If one of your gardening new year resolutions was to plant a tree, now is the time to make that a reality.

recognise that in communities, such as Hunterston and Torness, where a nuclear plant closes there will be an impact upon the local economy but this can be fully mitigated through decommissioning work

vehicles and the Fuuse’s technology will alert the council’s parking management teamany of those vehicles are not plugged in.The project is part of the council’s wider strategy to provide “attractive charging solutions” for people without a driveway or safe place to charge at home.Additional sensors will be installed nearby at Esk- side East, where the council will deploy further bollard-style ‘on-street’ chargers following successful trials last year.These chargers will continue to have no parking restrictions next to them, as the council says it recognises parking is at a premium in many residential areas.To address the fear these kinds of charger are frequently blocked, the Fuuse App will display the availability of parking spaces and not just the status of the chargers themselves.EV drivers who remain in charging spaces beyond a permitted duration – or after their session is complete – can also receive notications to vacate the space, allowing others to access the charger and avoiding fines.Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council transport spokesperson, said: “For those who don’t have a safe place to park and charge at home, seeing live, on-street status in their area will address potential concerns over finding an attractive space close to their home.“We know this can deter people from switching to EVs.“For those that choose to use our many destination or

infrastructure.“Utilising the long range of LoRaWan [long range wide area network] technology, the solution will be easily scalable across urban and rural environments.“This means East Lothian Council will be able to easily monitor and demonstrate the accessibility of their entire network and will be setting an innovative example to local authorities throughout the UK.”The project is funded by

I’ve been to Bamburgh beach several times before and it always works. It always make you stop and look – at the castle, which is the finest on this coastline of castles, and at the long stretch of sand, spread flat and gold, butter on toast, and back along the coast towards the village of Seahouses where we’re staying, at the Bamburgh Castle Inn. Scots may be brought up to think their coastline is the most beautul in the British Isles, but I’m not so sure. I’ve defected.The Castle Inn is also the perfect place to see and enjoy this part of the coast. The hotel sits at the top of the harbour and the dog-friendly room we’re staying in has its own little private garden that starts with a comfy terrace and ends with a view of the fishing boats and the pier and the North Sea. Winter’s on the way so the sea is in a bit of a bad mood when we arrive, but it doesn’t matter. We retreat to the hotel’s restaurant and order pints of Doom Bar and plates piled high with chips.The next day is more castles and our choice this time is Dunstanburgh, a ridiculously dramatic ruin a few miles south of Bamburgh. One of the best ways to get there is to park at the village of Craster and walk along the coast and there it is: charcoaled across the horizon, dark, ruinous. It was built in  not as a fortress against the Scots, as you might expect in this part of England in the th century, but as a fortress against the wrong kind of English . We circle the battlements. The sheep pay us no mind.Then, having let the distant past crowd in, we travel inland to a dferent, more personal kind of history. Our destination is the village of Allendale. We park near the King’s Head pub and head down the hill and there it is, parked incongruously, mockingly even, at the bottom of a flight of steps. It’s a Dalek and it’s the doorman of the Museum of Classic Sci-Fi.Inside, we meet Neil Cole, the creator and curator of the museum. It’s an extraordinary and exciting place for someone like me – whose hero was, is, and always will be Tom Baker – but for Neil it’s even more personal.He remembers playing in the fields and moors of Northumberland when he was growing up in the s and his childish mind could turn rocky outcrops into landing sites for Sontaran spacecraft and the moorland into the Death Zone on Gallrey. This is where his imagination, sparked by a TV programme, came to play.And now, aged , his vivid imagination has turned the basement of his home in Allendale into a fascinating museum full of the original props and paintings and monsters that he’s collected over the years. There is the head of a killer mummy and the face of an alien gastropod and a complete example of a Zygon, the race of aliens who hid in an underground base in Scotland and controlled the Loch Ness Monster. Neil says the magic is in getting close to the things that matter to you and I see what he means. It’s a wonderful place that delights in the possibilities of imagination and the craftsmanship of the people who turn imagination into objects.There’s something similar going on in the shop we visit on the way back to the coast: Re, in Corbridge. This town was once the place where the Romans controlled the north of Englandbut it’s now an attractive market town full of quirky shops and Re is the best of them. It sells a mixture of new and antique home accessories and we wander through little corridors of plates and cups and jugs, and past shelves of primary-colour cushions and end up in a corner piled high with yellow and red and blue slabs of soap. My urge is to buy it all.And the shopping is not done for the day. We head for Alnwick and the beloved Barters book shop, said to be the biggest second-hand book store in Britain. Who knowsit is or not but I do know how wonderful it is. It’s housed in a former railway station and there’s a model train that runs round the room to remind you of its origins. I spend two hours browsing, stop for a baked potato in the café, then do another two hours. In the land of castles, this is a castle of books.Bags full of goodies, we head back to the Bamburgh Castle Inn. Some pub restaurants rise above the phrase “pub grub” and this is one of them. The homemade steak and stout pie is a rich, handsome thing but so is the Tex-Mex veggie burger andseafood’s your thing, some Scottish mussels have also made their way down here. It is all topped off, naturally, with a few more sips of Doom Bar. We take our pints out to the terrace. Down at the harbour, some fishermen are working on their boat. A man is walking his dog up from the beach. The gulls glide. But we are still. We’ve stopping moving again. And we’re happy.TRAVEL FACTSMark Smith was a guest stayed at The Bamburgh Castle Inn as a guest of The Inn Collection Group www.inncollectiongroup.

It’s very important we stand united in the United Kingdom in the face of Russian aggression. ”Conservative MPs were also critical of what they have perceived to be a lack of action on honing in on Russian money being invested in the UK.Bob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee , said Britain was “a decade behind the times” on the threat posed by Russian financial influence.We need a long-term and coherent plan and a strategy to deal with a dangerous world. Our states need to understand how neo-authoritarian states use the full spectrum of state power military, economic, energy, espionage, political, etc. We are not there yet.  — Bob Seely MPFebruary , The Isle of Wight MP told the PA news agency: “On Russia, we have known about this problem for years.“The problem is that the front line with Ukraine is the border, the front line with Germany is the gas pipeline – and the front line with the UK is the City of London.“We need to be wiser about how the Putin regime acts and the potential threat to our institutions and values, and how we can protect them against a potential tsunami of questionable money.”Mr Seely also said any legislation should be widely targeted enough to incorporate the growing threat posed by China.FAC chairman Tom Tugendhat said it was time to clean out money from British politics that had originated in Russia.“Frankly, get it out and get it out now,” he told Times Radio.There was cross-party agreement that the changes being proposed in the Government’s economic crime legislation had been needed well before the crisis with Ukraine developed.Senior Labour MP Chris Bryant, who is also an FAC member, told PA: “This should have been in place before this whole saga, not after.“Talk about the horse having bolted.”Mr Bryant said warnings about Russian money had come from the Foreign Affairs Committee in  with its Moscow’s Gold report, as well as ’s Intelligence and Security Committee report on Russian influence in Britain’s democracy.He added: “It is like the Prime Minister has finally woken up to contraception the day after conception.”But the Prime Minister, speaking after a Cobra meeting about Ukraine and Russia border tensions, defended the UK’s record on tackling Russian monetary influence at home.He told broadcasters: “I don’t think that it’s fair to say the UK hasn’t done a huge amount on dirty money, whether it’s from Russia or anywhere .”Mr Johnson added: “What we want to do is strengthen now the package that we have, strengthen the measures we have against potential ill-gotten Russian money, whether here or anywhere for… which we have responsibility, with new measures that will hit the companies and concerns that I’ve talked about.“But also open up the Matryoshka doll,you like – you know what I’m talking about – so that we see … who really owns the companies that we’re talking about, who really owns the properties that we’re talking about, and those measures, yes, we will be bringing forward from the Economic Crime Bill.”He signalled that the Bill would be brought forward in the next Queen’s Speech.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We would urge everyone to plan their journeys in advance, exercise caution on the roads, and follow the latest travel advice.”Following a meeting of the Scottish Government’s Resilience Room, the Deputy First Minister said they would continue to monitor the situation as the storms approach.Services running in the far north, Kyle of Lochalsh, and Aberdeen-Inverness lines will continue to run as usual because the areas are outside the boundaries of the weather warning.“Scotland is bracing itself for Storm Dudley tomorrow,” the rail operator said on Twitter.“The welfare of our customers and staff is most important, so for safety reasons most ScotRail train services will shut down from  on Wednesday.”The RNLI warned adverse weather conditions could make seas “treacherous”, urging people to take extra care in coastal areas.“The expected storms could make our seas treacherous, increasing the risk for those visiting the coast around the UK and Ireland,” RNLI national water safety partner, Samantha Hughes, said.“In a normal year, around  people lose their lives at the coast and we know that more than half of those never intended to be in the water.“So, whether you are walking, running or cycling at the coast, please be extra responsible and avoid taking unnecessary risk or entering the water.“In particular, we ask people to stay well back from stormy, wintery seas and clf edges, check tide times before you go, take a phone with you, and call  or  and ask for the Coastguardyou or someone  is in trouble.”Meanwhile, the Woodland Trust Scotland urged people to stay away from wooded areas during the high winds.“Please do not enter woodland when winds are high and be cautious when entering woodland after a storm,” said spokesman, George Anderson.He added: “Even fully toppled trees are best avoided when newly felled as they are often not completely settled and still have the potential to move or tip.“We know a felled tree can be fascinating, especially to children, but it is not safe to clamber about on or under them.“Woodland Trust Scotland manages  sites across the country and, in the aftermath of any storm, public safety is our first concern.“Where paths are blocked, we will have them cleared as quickly as possible but, in the meantime, we call on the public to heed all path ersions and safety notices on sites.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

That’s partly because the risk isn’t as great to that cohort.“And we’re also waiting to hear from the JCVI to see whether they’ll need a booster on top of the booster for older age groups in the spring.”She added: “Of course, it’s likely to have been a very dficult decision for the JCVI, because generally, children have a milder illness and fewer hospitalisations. But, of course, they have to balance that against the prospect of missing school.“We have to consider very dferent issues when it comes to the vaccination of children as young as five years old, of course, so we’ll be in a position where we will expect those children to be accompanied by an adult. There will be a need for informed consent, but there will be an opportunity for siblings, for example, to be brought at the same time.”Baroness Morgan said children would receive the vaccine in health centres.The UK medical regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , approved the Pfizer Covid- vaccine for use in children aged five to  last year.The dose approved for children is lower than that used for adults and older children.After the announcement, the JCVI said that the vaccine should be offered to at-risk children in this age group. It is yet to announce its decision about wider use among children aged five to .Over . million dosages of the vaccine have already been administered to five to -year-olds in the US alone.A Government spokesperson in Westminster said: “We are reviewing the JCVI’s advice as part of wider decision-making ahead of the publication of our long-term strategy for living with COVID-. More detail will be set out shortly.”The Government in England is expected to make an announcement next week.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government urged Westminster to quickly publish the advice, saying they “stand ready” to implement any JCVI recommendation.“When the UK Government publishes the final advice on vaccination for  to -year-olds we stand ready to take it forward,” she said.“Following the update from the Welsh Government on this matter in the Senedd, we hope that the UK Government will publish the JCVI advice as quickly as is practicable.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

This vital work is aimed at improving skills, creating jobs and boosting our economy.Just this month, for example, a ‘revolutionary’ Hydrogen Training Academy was launched in Mid and East Antrim, which was a first-of-its-kind project enabling the Borough to fully maximise opportunities associated with hydrogen as the emerging leading sustainable energy solution.Major development opportunities are also moving another step forward with the signing of the Belfast Region City Deal in recent weeks.The deal unlocks poundbn of transformative co-investment, which will deliver more than  highly ambitious projects and programmes, including the re-development of Carrickfergus as a destination town, a major extension of The Gobbins clf path and the iC Innovation Centre within the wider St Patrick’s Barracks initiative in Ballymena.The total investment in Mid and East Antrim from City Deal will be almost poundm, with Council contributing pound.m.A range of exciting capital projects will also help our local community to enjoy more opportunities for outdoor play and recreation, with work underway on new and improved play facilities across the Borough, including play parks and multi-use sporting facilities.Businesses in Mid and East Antrim will also continue to benefit from key training, investment and innovation programmes over the last twelve months, and plans are well advanced to provide further opportunities for growth in several sectors as the post-pandemic recovery phase progresses.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?1644849796000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220214newscovid 19 mon 14th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.

Picture: Peter Morrison PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Picture: Peter Morrison PA WireLisa SmythTwitterFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAll Covid- legal restrictions in Northern Ireland will be replaced by guidance from Tuesday, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.Among the Covid- restrictions being removed from law are the requirement to wear a face covering in public places and the use Covid certicates in nightclubs – although their use in all hospitality and entertainment will continue to be encouraged.Mr Swann also reiterated his position that there are currently no plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland.The decision to scrap Covid- laws follows consideration of legal advice from the Attorney General and consultation with Executive ministers and moves the pandemic response in Northern Ireland into a new phase.However, announcing the swathe of relaxations, the UUP minister also stressed the continuing need for caution and vigilance as a further , cases and two deaths linked to the virus were recorded.Mr Swann, who revealed at the weekend that he had tested positive for Covid, said: “With the reduced threat from the Omicron iant, we can move away from an emergency and legalistic framework to a new approach where making safer choices is embedded in our daily lives.“That means all of us continuing to do our best to cut down risks of infection and transmission.“It means looking after each other by following the public health guidance. It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant.“The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann warned that coronavirus “is likely to stay with us in some form for some time” but he said emergency restrictions cannot remain in place indefinitely.He continued: “A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations.“This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others.“The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”Mr Swann has made the announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.“The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected,” he continued.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”As the hospitality sector will continue to be encouraged to use Covid certicates, Mr Swann said the importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings “will continue to be strongly emphasised”.Vaccine certication will continue to be available to the public – including for those who need it for travel abroad to satisfy entry requirements of countries they are visiting.Related topicsRobin SwannMore On Robin SwannBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance PremiumNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normality PremiumLisa SmythOpinionRobin Swann left in unenviable position over Covid- restrictionsHealth Minister Robin Swann tests positive for Covid-Most ReadAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentarySam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as Divis Hoods go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayJenner Dornan murder trial opens in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsMark BainOpinionThe end is nigh, and thankfully the world is looking brighter than two years agoLatestSandy Hook families settle with gun maker RemingtonA statistical look at women’s Test cricket as England host South Africa in JuneAlec Baldwin sued by family of cinematographer killed on setGarda chief to remain in place until Covid vaccine to be offered to all five to -year-olds in Wales, minister says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the books are written and history students look back on the early s, they’ll be forgiven for thinking they’re studying science fiction instead.Had a man with a sandwich board been shouting “the end is nigh” outside Belfast City Hall in February , it would have looked like he had a point. It was the end of the world as we knew it.Read MoreNiamh Campbell:OpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance“The end is nigh” means something dferent today, and we can all breathe a little easier.There is no doubt that without the restrictions we would be looking back on a lot more lives lost to Covid than the official figure of over ,.For many, their last moments were spent alone. For those who mourned, they watched from afar. That was one of the hardest restrictions to bear.Pulling our bedroom curtains closed on Monday, March , , we did so wondering what sort of world would await when we opened them the next morning.The UK death toll stood at , three of them here.St Patrick’s Day had already been cancelled, giving the first hint of what was heading our direction. Then lockdown started.Farewells were said to those in nursing homes as the doors closed to visits. Businesses shut, save for those deemed essential.The queues outside supermarkets started. Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation.

Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont department PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThe idea NI’s dficulty is nationalism’s opportunity is corrosive...

It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While Omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant.“The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann warned that coronavirus “is likely to stay with us in some form for some time” but he said emergency restrictions cannot remain in place indefinitely.He continued: “A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations.“This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others. The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”Mr Swann has made the announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.“The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected,” he continued.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”As the hospitality sector will continue to be encouraged to use Covid certicates, Mr Swann said the importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings “will continue to be strongly emphasised”.The Covid- regulations in Northern Ireland are not due to expire until March , but had been reviewed by the Executive every three weeks.The resignation of First Minister Paul Givan complicated the process of lting the remaining rules.Mr Swann was advised on the potential legal complications of him replacing regulations with guidance, without the wider endorsement of an Executive.On Monday Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Stormont ministers had given their unanimous support to Mr Swann to ease restrictions.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannMichelle O#NeillPaul GivanMore On The Executive Office PremiumCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekParties’ apology for abuse victims ‘will be welcomed’ PremiumNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityPoll’s negative comments on bonfires and flags in north Down criticisedCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young peopleMost ReadAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentarySam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as Divis Hoods go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayJenner Dornan murder trial opens in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Irish exports across border reached nearly bn euros in Sinn Fein ministers accused of ‘sectarian decisions’ over stadium fundingEnding of Covid rules is ‘not freedom day’ for NI, Young warnsTraders hope easing of Covid rules is ‘beginning of the end’ of pandemicCourts backlog could stretch beyond  without extra funding, minister warnsLatestGolda film producer admits to ‘stirring’ Jewish casting controversySandy Hook families settle with gun maker RemingtonA statistical look at women’s Test cricket as England host South Africa in JuneAlec Baldwin sued by family of cinematographer killed on setGarda chief to remain in place until ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This will have a universally strong impact on international food prices throughout .”Wilson’s Country agronomist Stuart Meredith cited how fertiliser prices have more than doubled over the past  months, with no sign of prices easing before planting of the first crops takes place over the coming weeks.“Supply and demand may actually become an issue through March and April, which may drive further price rises.“As many potato growers rely heavily on annual rental agreements, buying up stocks of fertiliser last autumn wasn’t an option for them as much of the land wasn’t secured at that stage.“Last year it was costing approximately £-£ per acre to fertilise a potato crop, depending on dferent soil analysis: this year we could be looking at somewhere in the region of £ ac.”Mr Meredith added that the demand for clean, virgin land has increased within all the agri sectors.He explained: “In turn, this has pushed the price being paid by potato growers for the right land up by approximately £ ac. Another input that has seen a signicant rise in price is fuel. It takes approximately L of diesel to produce an acre of potatoes.“Last year, red diesel was hovering around  per litre: at the minute it’s closer to p L.”Mr Meredith said some of the chemistry used in potato production has also experienced huge increases in price over the past few months.“Some products have doubled in price in the space of six months,” he added.Most ReadAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentarySam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as Divis Hoods go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayJenner Dornan murder trial opens in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Irish exports across border reached nearly bn euros in Sinn Fein ministers accused of ‘sectarian decisions’ over stadium fundingEnding of Covid rules is ‘not freedom day’ for NI, Young warnsTraders hope easing of Covid rules is ‘beginning of the end’ of pandemicCourts backlog could stretch beyond  without extra funding, minister warnsLatestGolda film producer admits to ‘stirring’ Jewish casting controversySandy Hook families settle with gun maker RemingtonA statistical look at women’s Test cricket as England host South Africa in JuneAlec Baldwin sued by family of cinematographer killed on setGarda chief to remain in place until ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

sectarian,” he said.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ca-d--be-ad_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP w

Frew raised the issue in exchanges with Mr Murphy in the Assembly chamber.On Monday, Ms Hargey told MLAs she would be unable to progress the £. million programme to redevelop local sub-regional football stadia due to the absence of a ing executive.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up She claims while the funding has been secured for the initiative, the approval of the wider Executive is required before it can progress to allocating funding for projects at specic grounds.Ms Hargey has blamed the DUP for the situation, claiming the party’s decision to pull Paul Givan out of the first minister’s role meant the stadia programme had to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.Both Ms Hargey and Mr Murphy moved on Tuesday to explain that the two projects were at dferent stages of progression, with the Casement redevelopment a live project that had been approved by the Executive, while the sub regional stadia programme had not reached the stage of identying what works would be undertaken.In the Assembly, Mr Frew accused accused the Sinn Fein ministers of “playing silly games” with the issue.“The sports regional sports stadium for football funding and the Casement Park funding has both been approved by this Executive,” he said.“Why has this finance minister and the communities minister made sectarian decisions to proceed with Casement Park, but to stop and halt the sports stadiums for football.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland de .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ca-d--be-ad_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland de .ece AUTOCROP w

Deirdre Hargey PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSinn Fein Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey In response, Mr Murphy claimed the DUP had not thought through the consequences of collapsing the Executive.“In scrambling to defend your own seats you haven’t thought through what the impact of that will be, and the impact is going to be very, very real across a range of communities and sports stadia are one,” he said.“The sub regional stadia have not identied any specic projects and would require to come back to the Executive for further approval.“The fact that you have collapsed the Executive means that all those clubs who are waiting on money will continue to wait on money until such times as you grow up and start to play at serious politics.”At a later press conference, Mr Murphy added: “To try and describe that as sectarian is an insult.”Minister Hargey insisted the funding for the programme was secure.The minister said while she would examine “other ways” to progress the initiative, she was signicantly limited by the absence of an executive.“I am ready to bring proposals forward before the end of this mandate,” she told BBC Radio Ulster.“The budget is there and I do think that it’s incumbent upon those other parties, particularly the DUP that chose to walk away, to look at that because this is the impact of their decision.”Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton dismissed Minister Hargey’s comments.“Deirdre Hargey has been in office for two years but has failed to deliver on an NDNAagreement to advance funding for football stadiums across Northern Ireland,” he said.“There is an Executive commitment on sub-regional stadia funding.“That could have been delivered upon at any time during the last two years, and it still should be delivered today.“For two years she has dithered, telling everyone that a result was just around the corner, but still today nothing has been delivered.”Most ReadAll Covid- restrictions

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God.

At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February .

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The spending plan had been out for public consultation when the DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the administration as part of its protest against Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.The draft budget had proposed a % increase in health spending in Northern Ireland, with £ billion earmarked for services over the next three years.The plan would have left other departments facing some tough choices as a result of the % cash increase for the health budget.While none of the other departments would have seen a reduction in their baseline allocation from the last budget, they would have been % down on what they would have expected to receiveextra funding were not being erted to health.“Since the resignation of the first minister I have considered all possible avenues that might have allowed me to proceed with a budget, including bringing it directly to the Assembly,” Mr Murphy told MLAs on Tuesday.“Unfortunately, the legal advice is clear that the budget must be agreed by the executive.“This means that on April  the health service will not be able to plan on a three-year basis, nor will it be equipped with additional resources to invest in waiting lists, cancer services and mental health.“In these circumstances, rather than improving, the health service will decline.”Mr Murphy said he had decided to pause the public consultation exercise on the draft budget.“Last week the Health Ministerapologised to people on waiting lists because without a multi-year budget, the opportunity to rebuild the health service would be ‘cruelly taken away’,” he said.“That analysis is sadly correct, although it should be the DUP apologising for the damage it is inflicting on the health service, not Minister Swann.”On the ability of spending hundreds of millions of carried over funds next year, Mr Murphy said: “Departments cannot plan to make use of this additional £ million in funding.“Instead the money will sit idle, until such times as an executive is re-established.”Mr Murphy said he would make a £ million in-year reallocation of Stormont funds to ensure the administration did not breach the limit of underspent cash it can carry over into the next financial year.This money will go to the departments of communities, education and infrastructure.“Having considered this matter at some , and taken legal advice, I intend to proceed to make allocations to these departments,” he said.“I have written to ministers to ask them for their views on this course of action and have made clear to them that the alternative is that funding that could be used to support local people and services might instead be lost to the Treasury.”Mr Murphy also highlighted the need to provide match funding for community groups supported through the European Social Fund .He urged DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to prioritise the ESF match funding from within his own budget.The draft budget had proposed a continuation of the current freeze on both the domestic and non-domestic regional rates for the next three years.Mr Murphy said that freeze could now only be continued for one year.“This freeze was intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike,” he said.“On the basis of legal advice, I can proceed with this freeze for one year only.“That means that households and businesses will not have certainty on their rates for the subsequent two years.”Mr Murphy said he would proceed with a proposed £ million rate relief package for businesses.The package would deliver a three-month rates holiday for sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, retail, tourism, hospitality, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports.“The executive should be on the cusp of agreeing a multi-year budget which prioritises health,” Mr Murphy added.“It should be deciding how to invest an additional £ million next year for housing, for skills, for the police, and for ESF match funding.“Due to the reckless actions of the DUP, this is not possible.“Instead, public services will operate on an emergency basis, without the benefits of long-term planning or additional resources, until such times as the executive is re-established.”Mr Murphy’s appearance before MLAs witnessed some sharp exchanges with DUP members.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan accused the minister of “amnesia”, highlighting that Sinn Fein pulled down the administration in  and left the region without a budget.“Minister, I see in your statement the Democratic Unionist Partyhas been mentioned four times but strangely no mention of your own party when they pulled this entire Assembly down in early  – no budget, no health support, no nothing,” he said.“Surely a case of amnesia from the members on the far side of the house, purely for political gain.“Can you and other parties not see the damage the Northern Ireland Protocol is doing to this place, are you blind to seeing that ”Mr Murphy insisted that the renewable heat incentivecontroversy that prompted the collapse of powersharing in  would have brought down any coalition government.He told Mr Buchanan: “Your party’s decision in order to scramble to save your own seatsis having very real consequences, a lot of them apparently unforeseen or not thought

Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeFormer economy minister Paul Frew accused Sinn Fein’s Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey and Finance Minister Conor Murphy of making “sectarian decisions” as he claimed they were treating one project dferently to the other.Mr Murphy responded by describing Mr Frew’s comments as an “insult”.“Neither the GAA or the soccer fraternity are sectarian,” he said.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.North Antrim MLA Mr Frew raised the issue in exchanges with Mr Murphy in the Assembly chamber.On Monday, Ms Hargey told MLAs she would be unable to progress the £. million programme to redevelop local sub-regional football stadia due to the absence of a ing executive.She claims while the funding has been secured for the initiative, the approval of the wider Executive is required before it can progress to allocating funding for projects at specic grounds.Ms Hargey has blamed the DUP for the situation, claiming the party’s decision to pull Paul Givan out of the first minister’s role meant the stadia programme had to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.Both Ms Hargey and Mr Murphy moved on Tuesday to explain that the two projects were at dferent stages of progression, with the Casement redevelopment a live project that had been approved by the Executive, while the sub regional stadia programme had not reached the stage of identying what works would be undertaken.In the Assembly, Mr Frew accused the Sinn Fein ministers of “playing silly games” with the issue.“The sports regional sports stadium for football funding and the Casement Park funding has both been approved by this Executive,” he said.“Why has this finance minister and the communities minister made sectarian decisions to proceed with Casement Park, but to stop and halt the sports stadiums for football.”In response, Mr Murphy claimed the DUP had not thought through the consequences of collapsing the Executive.“In scrambling to defend your own seats you haven’t thought through what the impact of that will be, and the impact is going to be very, very real across a range of communities and sports stadia are one,” he said.“The sub regional stadia have not identied any specic projects and would require to come back to the Executive for further approval.“The fact that you have collapsed the Executive means that all those clubs who are waiting on money will continue to wait on money until such times as you grow up and start to play at serious politics.”At a later press conference, Mr Murphy added: “To try and describe that as sectarian is an insult.”Minister Hargey insisted the funding for the programme was secure.The minister said while she would examine “other ways” to progress the initiative, she was signicantly limited by the absence of an executive.“I am ready to bring proposals forward before the end of this mandate,” she told BBC Radio Ulster.“The budget is there and I do think that it’s incumbent upon those other parties, particularly the DUP that chose to walk away, to look at that because this is the impact of their decision.”Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton dismissed Minister Hargey’s comments.“Deirdre Hargey has been in office for two years but has failed to deliver on an NDNAagreement to advance funding for football stadiums across Northern Ireland,” he said.“There is an Executive commitment on sub-regional stadia funding.“That could have been delivered upon at any time during the last two years, and it still should be delivered today.“For two years she has dithered, telling everyone that a result was just around the corner, but still today nothing has been delivered.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

TUV has always been clear that unionists need to vote down the ballot for all pro-Union candidates in the order of their preference. With the protocol a live issue this is all the more important.“TUV will be making it clear during the campaign and in our election literature that after voting TUV electors should continue to vote for pro-Union, anti-protocol candidates.” The UUP declined to comment on on Friday but told the News Letter today it would not be adopting the DUP-TUV policy.A UUP spokesperson said: “We are offering fresh leadership to Northern Ireland so we are asking people to vote for their Ulster Unionist Party Candidates. The Ulster Unionist Party believes the Northern Ireland electorate are more than capable of deciding for themselves who they should give their transfers to. “They need to be trusted more and dictated to less. It is up to each party to set out their vision for Northern Ireland to attract first preference votes and transfers.”The issue of maximising unionist votes has come to the fore even more than usual as unionists discuss how to respond to claims from some polls that Sinn Fein could emerge as the largest single party in this election.This has caused intense debate about whether Sinn Fein could take the First Minister position for the first time.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson responded: “The party of Carson and Craig flatly refuse to encourage transfers to other unionists. This comes only a few short years after the ‘vote Mike get Column’ debacle whereby the UUP urged voters to transfer to the SDLP.“It is clear the soul of the once proud UUP has been taken captive by a small cabal of liberals who believe that Twitter is the real world and that the praise being heaped on them by nationalists will translate into votes.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe law changes on Monday, March , removing the legal defence of reasonable punishment and opening the possibility for anyone who smacks a child to be prosecuted for assault.The Welsh Government passed the law change two years ago, seeing off opposition in the Senedd to win a vote - on what was described as a “landmark day for children in Wales”The government said the law change would help “protect children and their rights, and give them the best start in le”. By banning smacking, ministers argue children in Wales are now given the same protections from assault as adults.Physical punishmentis \"not a necessary part of disciplining children\" and \"doesn’t help children learn about self-control or appropriate behaviour\", the Welsh Government advises, adding that such punishments can hurt children and give them the message violence is an \"appropriate response to strong feelings\".The new law will apply to everyone in Wales, including visitors, and £. million is being invested in parenting support services.Advice and support for parents and s is available on the Welsh Government’s Give It Time website https:gov.wales parenting-give-it-time.Children’s charities like Barnardo’s Cymru and the NSPCC have supported the law change, but the ban has not been welcomed universally.As well as some opposition in the Senedd, mainly from the Welsh Conservatives, a campaign group called Be Reasonable argued the move would “inevitably catch ordinary, loving parents and turn them into criminals”, and their petition against the government’s proposals collected nearly , signatures in Wales.And the Welsh Government’s own studies suggest members of the public are equally ided over the issue.Researchers carried out three surveys between  and  to gauge public opinion on banning the physical punishment of children..removeWhile support for a smacking ban grew in , research shows that level fell slightly a year later. If anything, people’s opinions have become less rigid, with more people in  than in previous years saying they would need more information before deciding whether they agreed with the law change.Among those members of the public who said they supported a smacking ban in the last survey, more than one-thirdsaid they did not agree generally with the physical punishment of children.Other common reasons for supporting the ban included the belief there were other good forms of ensuring good behaviour and discipline , and the belief smacking was abuse, or could lead to abuse .Meanwhile, one in four peoplewho said they opposed the smacking ban in the most recent survey did so because they believed physical punishment was needed to control behaviour, the discipline a child, to teach respect or to show boundaries.Other common reasons for opposing the law change included the belief smacking doesn’t do any harm– including cases when people said it hadn’t done themselves or their own children any harm – and that smacking was OKit was a reasonable punishment and doesn’t go too far.Not everyone who smacks a child from March  will be automatically prosecuted. Wales four police forces have been encouraged to consider a \"rehabilitative alternative to prosecution\"this is more appropriate.\"In cases where the police decide it is appropriate to offer an out of court disposal, there will be an option of tailored parenting support to encourage positive parenting techniques and help avoid re-offending,\" the government has advised.Those parenting support schemes will be offered by councils. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s very important we stand united in the United Kingdom in the face of Russian aggression. ”Conservative MPs were also critical of what they have perceived to be a lack of action on honing in on Russian money being invested in the UK..removeBob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee , said Britain was “a decade behind the times” on the threat posed by Russian financial influence.We need a long-term and coherent plan and a strategy to deal with a dangerous world. Our states need to understand how neo-authoritarian states use the full spectrum of state power military, economic, energy, espionage, political, etc. We are not there yet.  — Bob Seely MPFebruary , The Isle of Wight MP told the PA news agency: “On Russia, we have known about this problem for years.“The problem is that the front line with Ukraine is the border, the front line with Germany is the gas pipeline – and the front line with the UK is the City of London.“We need to be wiser about how the Putin regime acts and the potential threat to our institutions and values, and how we can protect them against a potential tsunami of questionable money.”Mr Seely also said any legislation should be widely targeted enough to incorporate the growing threat posed by China.FAC chairman Tom Tugendhat said it was time to clean out money from British politics that had originated in Russia.“Frankly, get it out and get it out now,” he told Times Radio.There was cross-party agreement that the changes being proposed in the Government’s economic crime legislation had been needed well before the crisis with Ukraine developed.Senior Labour MP Chris Bryant, who is also an FAC member, told PA: “This should have been in place before this whole saga, not after.“Talk about the horse having bolted.”Mr Bryant said warnings about Russian money had come from the Foreign Affairs Committee in  with its Moscow’s Gold report, as well as ’s Intelligence and Security Committee report on Russian influence in Britain’s democracy.He added: “It is like the Prime Minister has finally woken up to contraception the day after conception.”But the Prime Minister, speaking after a Cobra meeting about Ukraine and Russia border tensions, defended the UK’s record on tackling Russian monetary influence at home.He told broadcasters: “I don’t think that it’s fair to say the UK hasn’t done a huge amount on dirty money, whether it’s from Russia or anywhere .”Mr Johnson added: “What we want to do is strengthen now the package that we have, strengthen the measures we have against potential ill-gotten Russian money, whether here or anywhere for… which we have responsibility, with new measures that will hit the companies and concerns that I’ve talked about.“But also open up the Matryoshka doll,you like – you know what I’m talking about – so that we see … who really owns the companies that we’re talking about, who really owns the properties that we’re talking about, and those measures, yes, we will be bringing forward from the Economic Crime Bill.”He signalled that the Bill would be brought forward in the next Queen’s Speech..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Starmer: PM needs to  uget his house in order on dirty Russian cash u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWales’ health minister Eluned Morgan said she had read the “yet to be published” report by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationand would be further rolling out the jab.There are reports the JCVI announcement of its decision on whether to expand the immunisation programme to younger children has been delayed due to a disagreement with the UK Government.Responding to questions during a Plenary session at the Senedd on Tuesday, Baroness Morgan called the hold-up a “shame” and “perplexing”.She said: “In relation to vaccination of children, the JCVI has yet to publish its report, although there are lots of clues inand other places where there seems to have been lots of leaks come out.“It’s a shame and it’s perplexing to understand why that has not been published yet.“But I have seen a copy of that advice and we will be commencing the rollout of vaccinations for five to -year-olds.”The minister has not set out a timetable for when youngsters will be able to get the jab, and told Senedd members: “We’re not going to do that as a matter of urgency, as we did over the Christmas period. That’s partly because the risk isn’t as great to that cohort.“And we’re also waiting to hear from the JCVI to see whether they’ll need a booster on top of the booster for older age groups in the spring.”She added: “Of course, it’s likely to have been a very dficult decision for the JCVI, because generally, children have a milder illness and fewer hospitalisations. But, of course, they have to balance that against the prospect of missing school.“We have to consider very dferent issues when it comes to the vaccination of children as young as five years old, of course, so we’ll be in a position where we will expect those children to be accompanied by an adult. There will be a need for informed consent, but there will be an opportunity for siblings, for example, to be brought at the same time.”.removeBaroness Morgan said children would receive the vaccine in health centres.The UK medical regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , approved the Pfizer Covid- vaccine for use in children aged five to  last year.The dose approved for children is lower than that used for adults and older children.After the announcement, the JCVI said that the vaccine should be offered to at-risk children in this age group. It is yet to announce its decision about wider use among children aged five to .Over . million dosages of the vaccine have already been administered to five to -year-olds in the US alone.A Government spokesperson in Westminster said: “We are reviewing the JCVI’s advice as part of wider decision-making ahead of the publication of our long-term strategy for living with COVID-. More detail will be set out shortly.”The Government in England is expected to make an announcement next week.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government urged Westminster to quickly publish the advice, saying they “stand ready” to implement any JCVI recommendation.“When the UK Government publishes the final advice on vaccination for  to -year-olds we stand ready to take it forward,” she said.“Following the update from the Welsh Government on this matter in the Senedd, we hope that the UK Government will publish the JCVI advice as quickly as is practicable.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Covid vaccine to be offered to all five to -year-olds in Wales, minister says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s a club that is constantly giving back to people in this area and it’s important that we support them, particularly now with renewed opportunities for sport as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.”Read More Read MoreGAA friends raise £k in memory of SmickoCara HunterCauseway Coast  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCovid-: Remaining restrictions to be lted in NI today...NewsSchool run mum was over the drink-driving limit...NewsIN PICTURES: Filming began in Dundonald last night of brand ...NewsSpeed limit changes planned for Cookstown roads and the A...NewsFuneral to take place for Fr Seamus McGinley, who died sudde...NewsMost PopularBest cocktail shaker sets UK : mix the perfect drink wit...RecommendedBest dehumidiers UK: keep your home warm and dry through w...RecommendedBest suitcases UK : easy to transport travel bags and la...RecommendedBest weighted blankets UK : sleep better, calm anxiety w...RecommendedBest snow sled and tobaggans UK : sleds for adults and ...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afbbfbceebbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccfcffadeaffcfea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?164484979600","title":"covid  mon th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.
