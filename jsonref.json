Don\u0027t wear a face mask with a valve. The valves mean your face mask is no use for protecting others.\u0027How can the government video not get this right?

Use any cloth face covering over mouth and nose.\u0027Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School with over 20 years experience in communicable disease control and infectious disease management, added: \u0027Just don\u0027t use masks with a valve. \u0027It propels expired breath forcefully and this, as in Bernoulli\u0027s principle, it will travel with greater velocity a lot further. It is not fit for purpose.\u0027The video remains on the government\u0027s Twitter account, where it\u0027s had over 153,500 views, however an additional one has now been shared featuring a woman wearing a mask without a valve.The new video, shared earlier this morning, also states that exemptions to the face covering rule include young children, people with breathing difficulties and people living with a disability. Masks with valves have been banned in parts of the US, including Florida and California. Marisa Glucoft, director of infection prevention Children\u0027s Hospital Los Angeles, previously said: \u0027When you wear a mask with a valve, people around you are not protected because the valve lets all of your breath into the air.\u0027From that perspective, it’s almost like you’re not wearing a mask at all.\u0027The San Francisco Department of Public Health also tweeted in May that masks with valves are \u0027NOT safe\u0027 and \u0027may actually propel your germs further\u0027.The government\u0027s face mask rules descended further into confusion today as Matt Hancock insisted they must be worn to get takeaway coffee but not in pubs.The Health Secretary also denied speculation that Boris Johnson wants to make masks compulsory in offices as part of a drive to convince workers to return.Meanwhile, official guidance published by the government overnight has raised fresh doubts about how it can be policed. Despite the threat of £100 fines, the document says people can have a \u0027legitimate\u0027 excuse for not wearing a face covering if it causes them \u0027distress\u0027.The Police Federation, representing rank-and-file officers, has said it is \u0027unrealistic and unfair\u0027 to expect them to patrol the aisles looking for people breaking the coronavirus regulations.Plea for coronavirus masks in confined spaces spreads confusion | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1798f1fda970361ba93035929024cfd0cb220624/406_292_4706_2824/master/4706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3bad25bb92dfc0346af0fcad60206b3","title":"face masks hand sanitiser and table bookings how a pub chain and salon embraced the new normal","story":"From hairdressers to pubs, reopening as lockdown eased required some clever adjustments. Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

At least 21 of the 40-plus cases in the cluster were hotel patrons, with onward transmission occurring at nearby gyms and at restaurants as far away as Brighton-Le-Sands, 25km east of the hotel.The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Wednesday that NSW would consider “further restrictions” but not lockdowns for “any activity which is high risk”.“The health advice tells us indoor events ... we know what is high risk,” Berejiklian said, a day after announcing marshals would enforce restrictions at all hotels and pubs in the state which would be limited to 300 patrons based on the one person per four square metre rule.Marylouise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW, said the emergence of pubs and restaurants as sources of transmission in the NSW cluster demonstrated how conducive indoor environments were to spreading Covid-19.However, she believes NSW will have to record 100 community transmissions over a 14-day period – when contact tracers and hospitals are nearing their rapid-response capacity – to warrant tighter restrictions being put in place. She believes this trend will be clearer by Tuesday.McLaws said by then there would be data for two incubation periods following the first spread of the virus at the Crossroads Hotel which would show whether there was potentially a second generation.“It’s not as easy ring-fencing a hotspot or a suburb, like what was seen with the public housing outbreaks in Melbourne,” she said.“That was residential, but we’re seeing social venues, pubs and restaurants, now attracting people who live all over Sydney.”McLaws said the current limit of up to 300 people allowed in some venues was “a lot of people” given alcohol can affect their ability to adhere to distancing measures, but said noted “the numbers aren’t telling me yet it’s necessary to decrease gathering limits”.Robert Booy, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, also argued growing infections in NSW did not justify increased restrictions yet.“Having hundreds of people in pubs is literally dangerous. When people are drinking they’re likely to mingle and that’s a real concern ... but what’s really hard is to keep balance between society functioning and our health.”Booy said restrictions should not have to be tightened if indoor gathering rules – including keeping 1.5 metres between patrons – were strictly observed.However, he conceded it would take “weeks not days” to see the impact of newly tightened rules on pubs introduced this week and how people responded to news coverage of the current outbreak.“I don’t think we should be making decisions based on two or three days of experience. We have to be considering the long term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf3f29a58aa579a23424c30c97621a3b43d89c8/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1734afc85235cb3e0a3cc4f7d4b314d2","title":"banks propose student loan style scheme for struggling uk businesses","story":"Report says scheme could help protect more than 750,000 small and medium-sized firms Up to three million jobs and more than 750,000 small and medium-sized businesses are at risk if companies cannot defer repayment on government-guaranteed loans.The banking lobby group TheCityUK has said recapitalisation of these loans is “essential” to protect SMEs, and businesses will need help tackling debt which could “hold them back or drag them under”.Their report calls for the creation of a new student loans-style scheme, where businesses could convert unmanageable loans into means-tested tax liabilities.The government has guaranteed nearly £43bn in loans to businesses across the country, with the Treasury digging deep to help a faltering economy hit by the coronavirus crisis.As ministers ordered Britons to stay at home unless they had to shop for food in March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to do “whatever it takes” to support the companies whose business would be decimated by the decision.It meant launching three government-backed loans, the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), a similar scheme for larger businesses called CLBILS, and the bounce-back loans, which help out some of the smallest companies.Repayments are due to begin in March 2021, but TheCityUK warned there was a need to “act quickly” given furlough schemes and rent deferrals are due to come to an end.The UK Recovery Corporation, as proposed by the group chaired by HSBC chairman Mark Tucker, would convert the loans into “new products allowing them to manage their debt in a more sustainable way and achieved without being put into default”.The proposed Business Repayment Plan, for those using the Bounce Back Loan Scheme or CBILS loans under 250,000, would see the loan balance turned into a tax obligation and repaid through the tax system, much like student loans are repaid now.Larger loans of up to £1m under the CBILS would be converted into an unsecured loan or preferred share capital.Sir Adrian Montague, Chairman of TheCityUK’s leadership council, said: “Covid-19 is a 100-year storm which has caused untold economic damage.“The government’s support schemes have been the essential sandbags holding back the flood, protecting businesses and saving jobs.“However, with tough trading conditions forecast to remain, paying back these loans will be challenging for many SMEs. To secure a strong recovery, action must be taken now to help them sustainably retrench, rebuild and return to growth.”Omar Ali, chairman of the group’s recapitalisation technical working group said “hundreds of thousands of businesses” could struggle with debt the have built up during the pandemic.He added: “Our analysis suggests that some sectors may enter into difficulty as early as autumn this year.“That is why taking action now is vital if we are to help businesses get back onto a stable footing as we emerge from the pandemic, and will ultimately support the UK’s economic recovery and fuel its future return to growth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bcc425fb1275ad4dfe2b282b61cc66c5cda04e/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2992ee1e927dbdb95f99c8d0d921e068","title":"incredible boohoo denying knowledge of factory allegations says mp","story":"Philip Dunne, chair of parliamentary committee, says it is ‘shameful’ it took pandemic for firm to acknowledge issuesBoohoo has been criticised by the chair of an influential committee of MPs, who said the online fashion firm had failed to address warnings of malpractice at Leicester factories.Philip Dunne, the chairman of the environmental audit committee, which questioned Boohoo co-founder Carol Kane about problems in Leicester factories in November 2018 for a report on the fast fashion industry, has disputed claims the group was not aware of potentially illegal working practices at factories making its garments.Boohoo said on 8 July that it was “shocked and appalled” by allegations that one of its suppliers was employing workers on less than the minimum wage and said it had launched an independent review of its supply chain.However, Dunne questioned how the company could be shocked by reports of malpractice in Leicester. “It is incredible that over a year since the committee highlighted illegal working practices in its supply chain, Boohoo has publicly denied any knowledge of what has been happening for years.“It is shameful that it took a pandemic and the ensuing outrage about working practices in their supply chain for Boohoo finally to be taken to task for turning a blind eye.”He added that Boohoo had not met a pledge to sign up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), a body which brings together retailers, trade unions and campaign groups to try and improve practice in supply chains.The ETI said Boohoo had not filed a formal application to join and had ceased directly communicating with it after the body asked the online retailer to enter talks with the Usdaw union over representation for workers at its Burnley warehouse.Dunne also criticised Boohoo for not formally recognising or meeting with Usdaw.Rival online fashion retailer Asos revealed on Wednesday that it was considering action against a Leicester supplier after finding the factory to be in breach of its ethical trading standards during the coronavirus outbreak.Nick Beighton, Asos’s chief executive, said one factory had been tagged as “red critical” in the last few months under Asos’s ethical audit process – flagging the need for urgent action over potential risks to workers or gaps in management systems.Beighton said its unnamed Leicester factory had been visited by executives last week and he would be visiting again on Friday before “making a decision accordingly” about its future relationship with Asos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1019319a02a8621a63b10dcfb554753303dad9a6/0_190_3454_2073/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42509016ed1c5f753c5762c4c424a749","title":"china avoids covid 19 recession unemployment us uk ecb markets business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsGetting back to the Chinese growth figures, economist George Magnus argues that China is enjoying a V-shaped recovery.The UK is gearing up for a record-breaking year for government debt sales.The Treasury announced this morning that the Debt Management Office will raise £385bn through sales of gilts, from April to November this year -- more than in any year before.The DMO had previously been aiming to raise £275bn in April to August, so this implies another £110bn will be raised in September to November.The higher volume of issuance seen so far this year due to COVID-19 is not expected to persist over the final four months of the year.Yesterday, chancellor Rishi Sunak warned of ‘tough choices’ to address the deficit, which is going to hit a peacetime record in 2020-21. Covid-19 has also taken a chunk out of Europe’s trade surplus.As a result, the EU recorded a €7.1bn surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world in May 2020, compared with €18.6bn in May 2019.The EU’s trade surplus with the UK has also narrowed this year.This has shrunk the EU-UK trade balance from €55.2bn to €38.5bn.

The markets continue to demonstrate a one step forward, one step back behavioural pattern,says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.“Weighing on global markets was new data from China which showed its economy returned to growth in the second quarter of 2020, but domestic consumption and investment remained weak.“On the UK market, technology, miners and consumer stocks were the main culprits for the index retreating. Energy, telecoms and utilities were the only sectors making any progress.The sell-off in China is spooking the City a little, with concerns that relations between Washington and Beijing may be weakening.Yesterday, markets had rallied sharply on hopes for a Covid-19 medical breakthrough , with reports that Oxford’s vaccine is showing good results.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, spies a tug-of-war between vaccine optimism and geopolitical angst:“Progress on vaccines and drug treatments is one of the reasons we retain a positive outlook on equities, as it helps underpin the case for controlling the virus without a return to full lockdowns.However, we continue to see geopolitical risks generating volatility, including the US election and US-China tensions.”Ironically, China’s better-than-expected growth in the last quarter could also be hurting stocks today.The economic rebound in Q2 could encourage Beijing to tighten policy, having hiked government spending and poured money into the economy to ward off the slump.That splurge has helped to drive equities up, so some traders may be tempted to take profits while they can.....Nathan Chow, economist at DBS Bank in Singapore, explains: Policy will remain supportive, but the pace of loosening may moderate given the strong credit expansion of the past months and the recent market surge.Oof! China’s stock market has just suffered its worst one-day fall in five months.As this chart shows, we’ve not seen such a big fall since Chinese investors returned from the Lunar New Year break on 3rd February (as the Covid-19 crisis was raging). But clearly the decline in retail sales has caused serious jitters - suggesting that households are still too nervous to spend heavily in the shops.Consumer-focused firms and technology companies led today’s rout:Beijing’s stimulus measures seem to be boosting manufacturing, but not feeding through to consumption. As Tapas Strickland, an economist at National Australia Bank, put it:“Maybe today there’s some kind of realisation that while the industrial side of the economy is really being driven by fiscal stimulus, the consumer side of the economy is a bit more problematic,” China has also hit back at the UK for banning Huawei from its superfast 5G mobile network.In a stern warning, the commerce ministry says the decision will make China warier of investing in the UK, and pledged to take measures in response.... Reuters has the details: Britain’s “discriminatory” ban on Huawei has severely damaged China’s investment confidence in the country, China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday, adding it will take necessary measures to defend Chinese firms’ legal rights.Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from Britain’s 5G network by the end of 2027.This chart from Bloomberg shows how China’s economy returned to growth in April-June, but still weak in historic terms:Stephen Innes, Chief Global Markets Strategist at AxiCorp, has put his finger on the problem with today’s Chinese economic data -- consumers aren’t really spending yet.China’s Q2 GDP growth beat consensus expectation, which is unambiguously positive for risk sentiment. But its what under the hood that matters most.No matter how much stimulus and fiscal sugar you try to entice consumers with, they will not leave their apartment and go on a spending spree until they feel confident the landscape is virus-free. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, is optimistic that China’s economy will avoid shrinking again this year, due to solid domestic demand.Kuijs explains (via the FT):In China the story is very reliant on what is happening domestically.“While in general it’s fair to say that the numbers beat expectations, what the numbers also reveal is that we’re seeing that the China consumer remains behind in terms of the recovery story.Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has plucked out some of the highlights:Iikka Korhonen, head of Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, is also concerned by weak consumer demand:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.China has become the first major economy to return to growth since the Covid-19 pandemic began.

Then coronavirus changed everythingFor three years, Ione Gildroy worked on Saturdays in her local library. The 18-year-old from Leicestershire issued and returned books, organised children’s events and stacked bookshelves. She planned to pool her earnings with some compensation she’d received after being in a car accident to pay for her dream gap year: Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bali, Australia. Working in a turtle rehabilitation centre on the Great Barrier Reef. An elephant sanctuary in Thailand.Gildroy booked the trip at the beginning of January. She’d heard of coronavirus then, but wasn’t worried. “I didn’t think it would even slightly affect my travelling plans,” she says. Gildroy looked forward to the summer of her dreams: a joint 18th birthday party with friends and then off backpacking.But then coronavirus hit. Her travel plans were ruined her raucous 18th birthday party was a picnic with her mum and a socially distanced visit to her grandmother’s. “It feels like all the rites of passage you go through when you turn 18 we haven’t gotten to go through,” says Gildroy. “I turned 18, but I haven’t been out for a drink anywhere. We only knew it was our last day of school the day before. We didn’t have to do our exams, sure, but I would have preferred to have done A-levels, and got all the good stuff that goes with it, such as going on holiday or having my prom.”These are strange times for this year’s cohort of A-level students. Schools and colleges closed in March exams were cancelled. Sectors young people would normally seek casual employment in, such as retail or hospitality, have been shedding staff at an alarming rate. Many universities, including Cambridge, are moving to online tuition. Apprenticeship opportunities have largely evaporated. For school leavers, this is a crucial time: deciding whether to travel, work or go to university. The pace of change at the age of 17 or 18 is the equivalent to years as an adult. But now, with plans shattered, these young people are facing a year in limbo.“Everything just feels really uncertain,” says Ben Forrest, 18, from Bradford. Like many others, Forrest had carefully sketched out his summer: two music festivals and a joint birthday party before studying journalism at the University of Leeds. “Before this happened, I was really excited,” he says. “Now I don’t know what to do with myself. When I’m occupied and doing stuff, I’m all right, but when you have those days when you’re not doing owt, it’s not great for the mental health side of things.”Although lockdown restrictions are being eased, there is no timeline for the reopening of clubs and festivals, and many teenagers have lost the part-time jobs they rely on to fund those activities. Forrest has been trying to make the most of the downtime: he is reading a lot and meeting friends in the park. But he still feels pretty down. “The summer between A-levels and uni is meant to be the best time of your life,” he says. “I’ve just spent it in my room.” Among Forrest’s friendship group, the levels of ennui are high. “Everyone is just disappointed, fed up and bored,” he says.Losing your freedom and autonomy just as you are trying to make your mark in the world can feel devastatingly limiting. “Emerging adulthood is the period when people are trying to reach lift-off in their adult lives,” says Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts. “That time is really difficult, and to have that all come to an end, even temporarily, is painful.” He explains that the lockdown will be felt more acutely by 18- to 24-year-olds than any other generation. “You’ve gone through puberty, with the rush of hormones that entails,” says Arnett. “You’re confronting big questions about what you want your future to look like. When you’re thwarted from exploring those questions as you had intended, you’re likely to see anxiety and depression.”Covid-19 has also forced school leavers to make hard calculations about their future: do they push ahead with their university plans or defer for a year in the hope that a vaccine will be made available, and that they will be able to have a more typical student experience? Faced with the prospect of online-only learning and a lacklustre, socially distanced freshers’ week, many students are choosing to defer. “I feel like with university next year, my education will be very halfhearted,” says Jawwad Khan, 18, from London. “Especially when you’re paying £9,250 a year for online learning. It’s like buying an online book over a real book. You’d rather have the real book.”Like Khan, 17-year-old Morgan Davies, from Warrington, is also deferring. He has a scholarship to the University of North Carolina to study economics. “I really wanted the full freshman experience,” Davies says. “I wanted to ‘rush a frat’ and go to Halloween parties.” In anticipation of the college year, he had befriended his roommates online, and socialised with them on Zoom.But Davies’s university is moving to online learning, meaning there will be no in-person lectures or frat parties. At first, Davies thought he could study from his dorm, but the US immigration authorities recently announced that international students would not be allowed into the US if their courses were online-only, meaning that Davies faces the prospect of spending his first year at university in his bedroom in Warrington, studying in US time zones. “For me,” Davies explains, “university is about being physically present … although it wouldn’t affect me academically, being there was a huge part of going to the US. I thought I’d rather delay a year and get the full experience.”Not all students plan to defer. “I’m definitely starting university in September,” says 18-year-old Lily Good, from Aylesbury, who plans to study politics and sociology at the University of Exeter. “I was umming and ahhing, and wasn’t really sure what to do. But things are reopening now, and I’ve spent so much time at home this year. I honestly cannot wait to go somewhere new, meet new people and have a new start in a different place.” Good is optimistic that she will be able to have a relatively normal student experience. “I think that, even if social distancing is officially in place, I can’t imagine 18- and 19-year-old students staying apart, especially in halls and stuff. And, hopefully, the clubs won’t be shut for too long.”Already, there are indications that exam boards may mark this cohort of students harshly. After the international baccalaureate (IB) examiners released its grades this month, online forums erupted in fury: scores of students felt their grades had been unduly marked down, causing them to miss out on university offers. The IB grading body is now being investigated by England’s exams regulator, Ofqual. “I’m stressed,” Finiin says. “I worked so hard for the offer, and I was ready to transition all my efforts into getting the grades. If I don’t get the grades, I don’t know what I’ll do.”If you had banked on entering the world of work via an apprenticeship, now is just about the worst possible time to be a school leaver. “Apprenticeship vacancies have collapsed,” says Kathleen Henehan of the Resolution Foundation. “There were just under 2,000 apprenticeship vacancies in England this May, compared with 13,000 the May previously.” This month, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced incentives for employers to hire more apprentices. “It’s a nice step, but there’s a big question mark as to whether that’s enough to incentivise employers struggling to hire them,” says Henehan.Mason Gunn, 16, from North Shields, left school this year. He planned to find a level-one electrical apprenticeship. “Most companies I’ve spoken to have said if it wasn’t for Covid they would have taken me on,” he says. “They all said the same thing – ‘lack of work due to Covid’ but they would ‘keep me in mind’.” Gunn has phoned or emailed more than 35 local firms, with no luck. “I’m trying to stay positive because I understand that many of these companies are struggling to pull in money, so having an apprenticeship would only make things difficult.”And young people who had hoped to enter the workforce straight away will find themselves on the sharp end of hiring freezes. “School leavers always tend to suffer during recessions because there are fewer vacancies,” Henehan says. “And when firms are hiring, they want someone with more experience.” She explains that during the 2008 crisis, graduates were pushed into jobs previously taken by non-graduates – leaving the non-graduates jobless. “I’m kind of scrambling to get work even remotely related to the field of work I want to do,” says Marianne Zamgoni, 18, from Doncaster.Zamgoni planned to get a job as a trainee estate agent on leaving school: she was getting interviews for positions before Covid-19 hit, and then everything dried up. She has applied for 50 jobs in the past three months, with no luck. “I have signed up for every job website under the sun,” she says, “and whenever I get an alert about a new job post, I apply for it.” All the firms who come back say the same thing: they’re on a hiring freeze. Zamgoni is trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard to not be dispirited. “It can be quite depressing every time you open an email and it says: ‘Sorry to inform you …’” she says. “My future feels very uncertain.”The Resolution Foundation recently predicted that more than a million young people would be unemployed in the coming years. “I wouldn’t want to be 18 right now,” sighs Henehan. “In terms of the labour market, it’s too soon to tell if this recession will be worse than it was in the 1980s, where we had mass youth unemployment, but it’s possible … it certainly looks more challenging than the 2008 financial crisis. At least in this century, this is the worst time to be a young person.”Being 18 right now can feel a little like being a member of a cursed generation. “We’ve had it so bad,” says 18-year-old Aisha Akram from Manchester. “We had the new GCSEs, when there was a new curriculum and no past papers. And now Covid.” Akram, who plans to study psychology at the University of Manchester next year, worries about her generation’s long-term prospects with a recession looming. “It’s probably going to be really hard to get a job when I graduate,” she says. Some of Akram’s friends think deferring will improve their job prospects – the labour market should be in better shape by then – but Henehan says that is far from certain: “If everyone stays in education a bit longer, they all exit en masse, and will be competing for the same jobs.”Finiin’s friends have started jokingly referring to themselves as the “class of Covid-19”. “I remember our economics teacher joking about coronavirus in January, and everyone was laughing,” Finiin says, “and then – bam! – we were all locked down in our houses and school was cancelled. Everything happened at once.

Our generation is going to make a big change in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/823b41c7109656ae2087efbc7aec4616dc77866a/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=944e3f23da8c9abe24ff6a6b25f97d29","title":"climate change made siberian heatwave 600 times more likely study","story":"Human fingerprint on record temperatures ‘has rarely, if ever, been clearer’, says reportThe record-breaking heatwave in the Siberian Arctic was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused climate change, according to a study. Between January and June, temperatures in the far north of Russia were more than 5C above average, causing permafrost to melt, buildings to collapse, and sparking an unusually early and intense start to the forest fires season. On 20 June, a monitoring station in Verkhoyansk registered a record high of 38C. An attribution study shows such prolonged heat over the first six months of the year would have been almost impossible without the effect of greenhouse gas emissions from industry, transport and farming.The team of researchers from international universities and meteorological services, including the PP Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in the Russian Academy of Science, calculated this human impact added at least 2C of warming to the region.The authors of the study say the Siberian heat would happen less than once in every 80,000 years without human interference.Andrew Ciavarella, a lead author of the research and senior detection and attribution scientist at the Met Office, said the findings were staggering. “This research is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming global climate. Importantly, an increasing frequency of these extreme heat events can be moderated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”Scientists say the human fingerprint has rarely, if ever, been clearer. “This is the largest signal we have seen,” said Friederike Otto, the acting director of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute and a co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative. “This study shows again just how much of a game-changer climate change is with respect to heatwaves. As emissions continue to rise, we need to think about building resilience to extreme heat all over the world, even in Arctic communities – which would have seemed nonsensical not very long ago.”Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique\u0026nbsplast year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.The need for stronger resilience was evident when melting permafrost and poorly maintained equipment led to one of Russia’s worst oil spills, from a power station near the industrial city of Norilsk, on 29 May.Prof Olga Zolina, of the Institute of Oceanology in Moscow and another lead author, said the fate of Norilsk could be an indicator of what lies in store for other northern communities. “It means we should do something. This town is very small, with about 1,000 inhabitants. But there are other bigger cities in the Arctic circle. For them the mounting high temperatures are very important.”Concerns are also growing that the high temperatures are worsening positive feedback loops by melting heat-reflecting ice and increasing the range and intensity of wildfires in Siberia, which is home to the world’s largest forest.The season’s fires started unusually early, in April, and have been detected further north than ever before. According to the EU’s Copernicus satellite monitoring service, Siberian blazes released 59 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in June, the highest amount on record.Nasa says some embers smoulder through the winter in peatlands and then flare back to life in the spring. The dangers of such “zombie fires” is increased by warmer temperatures. The melting of the tundra also increases the risks of a release of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Since the middle of June, the extent of the fires has more than doubled to more than a million hectares.The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, but the trend towards more extreme conditions is apparent elsewhere. At the start of the year, Australia had unprecedented bushfires and Antarctica registered exceptionally high temperatures. The UK Met Office is more cautious. Despite several record months, it said global average surface temperatures in 2020 were still not at 2016 levels and a cooling La Niña was now developing. “While 2020 is running very high, there is no guarantee of a record this year,” said Prof Adam Scaife, the head of Met Office long-range prediction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c686a50667410ec40973b7738e9e12334657d787/0_3_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=efc15c9dd024b1929ad9109259d6c125","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

I found myself utterly absorbed – more so because I went away and read the 1924 short story on which it’s based, by the Austrian author Robert Musil, known for his monumental and unfinished The Man Without Qualities.In the early 16th century, an unnamed Portuguese noblewoman (played by newcomer Clara Riedenstein) has married the aristocratic Lord von Ketten (Marcello Urgheghe). When he goes to war in Italy, she stays behind with her retinue and ladies-in-waiting, waiting for his return for over a decade in a becalmed state of torpor and inscrutable discontent. When her husband finally does come back, exhausted, unwell, disillusioned with war’s supposed glories and embittered after peace negotiations with his enemy, the Bishop of Trent (Alexandre Alves Costa), he conceives a jealous dislike of his wife’s attractive young cousin, Pero Lobato (João Vicente), who has come to visit. There is a haggard choric figure of an old woman, played by the veteran German star and Fassbinder veteran Ingrid Caven.Everything about the movie is uncompromisingly andante: there are static shots, wonderfully composed painterly tableaux, with highly wrought details and focal points to be noticed in various corners of the frame, perhaps inspired by Velásquez (although at other times cinematographer Acácio de Almeida has apparently taken something from Millais’ Ophelia or Leonardo’s Lady With an Ermine).The Portuguese woman capriciously decides to make a pet of a feral cat and also a wolf cub that becomes full-grown under her care, a development replete with heraldic significance – and she is enraged when her husband takes against the animal. There is something amazingly unworldly in this film: it is a challenge, certainly, and needs an investment of attention, but there is a gorgeous refinement and intelligence to it.• The Portuguese Woman is available on Mubi from 20 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54b6d3427d2ff49aa86c49c08f240f06addf5706/110_21_1554_932/master/1554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56ad0a53768d93f6c98c32e9ec777c54","title":"labour asks government to deliver manifesto pledge of fan led review","story":"The Labour Party has called on the government to “deliver on its manifesto pledge to football fans” by implementing a review into the reform of the game.The sustainability of the football pyramid has been called into question amid the Covid-19 crisis, while long-running issues over governance contributed to Wigan Athletic’s dramatic slump into administration this past month.The government had promised a “fan-led” review into the structures of the national game in its election manifesto last year but has yet to commission the review or draw up its terms of reference.Alison McGovern, the shadow minister for sport, has written to the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, asking for a cross-party process to deliver the committee, which she says “must be genuinely driven by what fans want and need, from the grassroots up”.In her letter, McGovern also pointed to a previous review, commissioned by the digital, culture, media and sport committee in 2011, that said “big changes need to be made to the way football is run in England to address financial instability” but which was never fully implemented.“Almost ten years on, the situation is becoming urgent,” she wrote. “Like other challenges in our country, Covid-19 has magnified the long-term structural challenges for football. What happened at Wigan Athletic is a perfect example.“Labour MPs are very concerned about the financial future for many clubs in the immediate term and we believe that no community should lose a much-loved club and local institution as a result. We hope this is an objective the government can support.”Talks between the government and football’s governing bodies have been ongoing during the pandemic and were central to enabling the restart of the Premier League and Championship.One government condition of the return of live football was that it should ultimately provide financial benefit to the whole football pyramid. There remain, however, significant differences of opinion over how that should play out, with the EFL calling for a bailout of the lower leagues and the Premier League insisting it has done all it can by advancing monies that otherwise might not have been paid.The review, it has been determined, will assess the controversial owners’ and directors’ test, which played a part in the disastrous Wigan takeover in June. The department for digital, culture, media and sport confirmed that other details had yet to be decided.“The government has committed to a fan-led review of football governance, which will include consideration of the owners’ and directors’ test,” it said. “We will shortly be deciding on the scope and structure of the review and will announce further details in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/192227b34b289f175d613c206eb470ac6393ec94/0_27_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=401b9610b0ef154393ee823116b555d1","title":"david oleary leeds premier league champions league semi finals","story":"Leeds are on their way back to the Premier League. Nineteen years ago they made it to the Champions League semi-finalsBy The Coaches’ Voice for the  Sport NetworkIt was very frustrating at the start of the 2000-01 season. We just couldn’t get going. We lost to Manchester City and drew with Coventry, two teams that ended up getting relegated, and then drew against a Derby side that just avoided relegation. At that stage we were missing a lot of key players due to injury, though. I felt that, once we got all our players back and the new players had bedded in, there really was great potential in the team.The ambition for the season was to get into Europe again and improve on the previous year, when we had finished third in the Premier League and made it to the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup. The title was out of the question – there were more capable teams than us – but I knew we had a special team and the club just wanted to see improvement on the pitch.Thanks to the sale of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to Atlético Madrid a year earlier, we were able to invest in players. I’d been to Scotland to watch Mark Viduka playing for Celtic a few times and knew he would be perfect for us. He was a big, strong forward who could hold the ball up and someone we could play off, but he could also score plenty of goals. I was never involved in the financial side of things, but I told the board for the money – around £7m – he was absolutely perfect for us and they agreed. We got him and he turned out to be one of my best ever buys.Then there was Olivier Dacourt, who I’d been impressed with when he was at Everton. I thought he would be ideal for us. It was then about getting him to come to Leeds and selling him the dream of what he wanted to do. Again, we got our man – Olivier was another brilliant signing who improved the team.We’d made that poor start to the season domestically and we also had a tough draw in the Champions League qualifying round, against 1860 Munich. We weren’t playing well, but we managed to scrape through over two legs after a brilliant 1-0 away win in the second leg.We got Barcelona, Milan and Besiktas in the first group stage, and we didn’t have our players back from injury in time for the first game – a daunting trip to the Nou Camp. Anybody can go to Barcelona and get beaten, but if you go there with a young team like ours and missing six first-team players, you’re in trouble. To have any chance you need your full team out, but we didn’t have that – and it turned out we were in a lot more trouble than I’d predicted.We got absolutely hammered. We were 2-0 down inside 20 minutes and ended up losing 4-0. Some people behind the scenes were in a panic after that game, but they didn’t understand what Barcelona was or the problems we had. It was our first game as a young team going to a club like that and we did it with half a squad. For all I was gutted we’d got beaten, I knew there were reasons behind it.I knew we were a lot better than that result made out, so I knew we would improve – and we did. We went unbeaten for the remaining five games of the first group stage, beating Milan at home and getting a draw away, as well as drawing at home to Barcelona.So we qualified for the second group phase, where we were drawn against Real Madrid, Lazio and Anderlecht. Three capital cities. We went to some amazing places – Munich, Madrid, Rome, Brussels, Barcelona, Milan, Istanbul – all in one season. The great thing about that squad was that they were young and a bit naive. So they were totally fearless and really, really brave. We had some great young players. Players like Jonathan Woodgate, Harry Kewell, Alan Smith and Stephen McPhail, who could handle the pressure of playing in the biggest games.They weren’t experienced and never overanalysed things. They relished the big occasions and they would never freeze, even on the biggest stages. We would train on the pitch before an away game and you could just tell the players were inspired by playing in the biggest, most famous stadiums on the planet and what had happened at these venues. From the Bernabéu to the San Siro, they wanted to be part of the stadium’s history.We added another unbelievable young player in November, when we signed Rio Ferdinand from West Ham. We had a brilliant leader in Lucas Radebe – but he was struggling with his knee, so the club asked me for three options to recruit, all at different prices. I said Rio was the top one we could get, but I told them he would cost about £10m. I was actually quite shocked when they told me we were signing him for £18m – I might even have expressed doubts if I’d been asked about it – but they were convinced. He was already a world-class player and he proved to be an incredible signing.Real Madrid beat us at Elland Road – Raúl and Fernando Hierro got the goals – and then we went to Rome to play Sven-Göran Eriksson’s special Lazio side, who had won Serie A the year before. Viduka was as good a centre-forward as anyone in Europe that night and we got a result, winning 1-0 through an Alan Smith goal 10 minutes from time. That was a great occasion and Sven was very complimentary afterwards.We were still struggling with playing in Europe and keeping up our league form, though. We were a young group learning on the job, but we were expected to do what Manchester United and Arsenal had been doing for years. After a big European night and the travel, we were tired and often struggled to refocus. After the win in Rome, we went to Southampton on the Saturday, played really poorly and lost.We got very lucky against Anderlecht in our next European games, though. By the time we played them in back-to-back Champions League matches in February, we had the weekend in between off because we’d already been knocked out of the FA Cup. We didn’t play well in the first game at home but we dug out a win, coming from behind with two late goals. Then we had the whole weekend to prepare for the second game, with the experience and the lessons of that first game fresh in our minds.Olivier Dacourt heard that the Anderlecht coach had said we were lucky in that first game and that our players were overrated, so when he told the rest of the squad about that it was a great motivation for the return game. The players always had a great attitude, but that gave them added incentive. Our performance in Brussels was probably one of our best in my entire three years at Leeds. We won 4-1 and completely annihilated them. It all came together perfectly.Three days later, we went to Tottenham and won – and won well. That was particularly pleasing. It was always going to be a tough game. They were managed by former Leeds manager George Graham, who I was managed by at Arsenal and was assistant to at Leeds. So they – and he – really wanted to win, but we proved we were learning how to maintain our Premier League form after coming back from a European game.We were on a hell of a run, and played superbly to beat a really top-class Deportivo La Coruña in the quarter-finals. We played our best football for a full 90 minutes in the first leg, with a great atmosphere at Elland Road. We won the game 3-0, with goals from Ian Harte, Smith and Ferdinand.I knew it wasn’t over, though. Deportivo were a team that scored a lot of goals and we faced an onslaught in the away leg. We got a right lesson in that return game, but we only lost 2-0 and clung on – deservedly – to progress.We’d started off in August against 1860 Munich and nobody would have believed in May we’d be playing a semi-final against Valencia. Of course it was very disappointing when we lost to them, but I was so proud of the team. Valencia were a very, very experienced team – they’d got to the Champions League final the year before and had knocked a very good Arsenal side out in the previous round.We had played loads of games over the course of the season, but fatigue didn’t come into it. We were just beaten by the better team over two games. The players had overachieved massively, and I was lucky to have had that group. We made it so near, but just couldn’t make that final step. We finished the league season strongly but missed out on the Champions League places by a point, so we didn’t have the chance to go on another run like the 2000-01 season.It was a real pity we never won anything. A bit like Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, with the team we had at that time, we really should have won a trophy. We’d put together a really top group of lads who wanted to play the football I asked them to play, and they were full of hunger.Even though we didn’t win anything, the Leeds supporters were always behind me. I cannot believe the way I’m treated by them, even now. They always let me know they were on my side. That run to the Champions League semi-finals built a bond between us that will always be there.• This article was published first by The Coaches’ Voice• Follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f89928413bdb03676d5daea68a915207ea780ad2/0_346_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7dd6ccf54360eb535dd40b5a906d9196","title":"artists kabul mural artlords afghan imagery corruption","story":"Muralists are covering the Afghan capital’s blast walls with agitprop imagery and calling out corruptionby  Stefanie Glinski in KabulFrom the killing of George Floyd in the US and the drowning of Afghan refugees in Iran, to the signing of the US-Taliban agreement towards peace and brutal murder of a Japanese aid worker, a group of Afghan artists have taken paintbrushes to adorn Kabul’s grey blast walls with vivid imagery.The barriers have been transformed into politically inspired murals, which the artists hope will create “visual dialogue” and raise awareness of corruption and injustices.The war-torn Afghan capital is full of these large concrete barriers, often separating diplomatic and governmental headquarters from the rest of the otherwise beautiful city of rolling hills and old brick houses.The worsening security situation and countless attacks have seen more blast walls built all over Kabul, blocking off roads and sheltering buildings and people from potential suicide bombs.Kabul’s green zone, a highly fortified area home to embassies and news agencies, is surrounded by tall, heavy walls.Since 2014, Artlords – a word play on warlords and drug lords, of which Afghanistan has many – a collective of artists and volunteers, has put some of the country’s politics into paintings, aiming to reflect the city’s atmosphere.“We want to turn public opinion into murals, that’s why we paint what we hear on the streets,” explained Abrar Kakarr, Artlords’ programme manager. “We don’t want to offend, we want to criticise.”The group recently sketched a portrait of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man killed by police in Minneapolis, as well as a mural of Afghan refugees drowning in a river in Iran after fleeing their home country It is alleged that Iranian border guards forced them into the water at gunpoint.“We painted those in a day,” Kakarr said. “We usually electronically project the image against the wall and then e into the painting process with brushes, ladders and a bunch of volunteers.”Another mural, of the head of a Japanese aid agency, Tetsu Nakamura, who specialised in irrigation projects and was killed by gunmen in the eastern city of Jalalabad in December, went up in Kabul shortly after his murder. “Let’s not plant anything but the seed of love and friendship in this pure land,” a line next to his painted profile reads.The group has 10 members of staff, including some artists, and around 35 volunteers.All this inspired Artlords co-founders Omaid Sharifi and Kabir Mokamel to paint their first mural: a pair of eyes and the words “I see you” – aimed at questioning the “corrupt government” and creating dialogue.Since then, the group has painted almost 2,000 murals in 19 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Some work has been commissioned by UN agencies and embassies to raise awareness about the development agenda. But other independent pieces are aimed at stirring political debate.The group – now mainly funded by international donors – has faced praise and criticism. Some have questioned whether beautifying explosion-proof walls denies their purpose and the continuing war in the city, but Artlords has said it will continue to promote messages of peace and social justice, as well as use its work to target alleged government corruption.“Artlords has increased the authorised use of graffiti on the concrete walls segregating military and governmental actors from the public and with it has transformed the city’s walls into public canvases,” says Paniz Musawi Natanzi, a German-Iranian academic who holds a doctorate in gender and cultural politics with a focus on Afghanistan.Some murals may have caused controversy, but so far only one has been removed. Two years ago, the group painted a portrait of Hamida Barmaki, a law professor and human rights activist killed with her husband and four children in a 2011 suicide attack claimed by Hizb-i-Islami militants. The mural, painted on a blast wall near the home of the militants’ leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar – a former mujahiddin chief who has since entered the Afghan government – was quickly removed by Hekmatyar’s men.“They took buckets of paint to it,” Kakarr said. “We hoped to make a point: Look, he has joined the government, but he’s a killer.” His crimes were pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal.“We want to be a voice for the people through our art. We want to make sure that those who are in power hear this voice and feel ashamed. They should know that people have not forgotten the crimes that they have done during the past years,” said Sharifi in response to the vandalising of Barmaki’s memorial mural.Kakarr added: “Politically, we’re facing an uncertain future in Afghanistan. Many people fear the Taliban gaining strength many are directly affected by killings and attacks. We hope our murals can address the suffering and injustices faced and point towards peace.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29fbe1e8ddf81ae748b68b8df055811d3152dbbf/0_206_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db19a3b1df037a81a78c30bb1dedd4c","title":"mexico coronavirus municipalities of hope","story":"More than 300 towns free of Covid-19 were allowed to reopen in May to mitigate the pandemic’s economic cost. With cases surging, most have been forced to closeAs the coronavirus pandemic advances across Mexico, leaving thousands dead in its wake, Tepango de Rodríguez has – so far – remained untouched.The town of about 4,000 people sits high in the mountains of the Sierra Norte in Puebla state, and was quick to apply strict preventive measures, closing its food market and installing health checkpoints.“The local health councillor put in a lot of effort to remind people to stay home and use face masks,” said Ismael Domínguez Ruiz, a historian who runs a Facebook page in the town. “She was practically going door-to-door to remind people what to do.”In May, Tepango de Rodríguez was included on a list of 324 towns that the Mexican government decided were eligible to reopen early, as part of a program called “Municipalities of Hope”.The plan allowed places with no Covid-19 cases – and with no cases in surrounding areas – to start lifting restrictions, in an attempt to mitigate the shutdown’s devastating economic impact.But less than two months later, Mexico has become one of the worst-affected countries in the world, with at least 311,000 cases and 36,000 deaths. And the list of Municipalities of Hope has dwindled to a few dozen.One town – Ometepec, Guerrero, lasted less than 14 days on the list. “In just a few weeks, we went from zero to 47 confirmed cases and six dead,” said Ulíses Moreno Tavárez, who lives in the town.According to Dr Carlos Magis Rodríguez, a professor of medicine and a public health researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, a lack of serious lockdown measures doomed the strategy from the beginning. “If there were strict control of entrances and exits, a quarantine upon arrival, it could have worked,” Magis Rodríguez said. “The places this has worked are practically islands.”The shutdown of the country’s capital has further complicated matters, sending thousands of potential carriers back to rural areas. Even in remote towns where residents installed their own health checkpoints, “they block entrances to block visitors with the virus – but not to residents who returned from Mexico City,” said Magis Rodríguez.Across Latin America, poor families have faced an impossible choice – between obeying quarantine measures and starving, or venturing out to work despite the danger of infection.But unlike other leaders, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has not introduced stimulus measures to help the most vulnerable population, instead pushing through a string of severe austerity measures – even as he emphasized the need for the economy to stay open.The president, popularly known as Amlo, has also downplayed the pandemic – claiming in April that Mexico had “tamed” the virus – and repeatedly emphasized the need for the economy to stay open, striking a notably more relaxed tone than warnings from the country’s Covid-19 tsar, Hugo López-Gatell.This week, López-Gatell expressed concerns about the virus’s resurgence in areas that had reopened too quickly – only to be contradicted by the president, who insisted that “going out to the street is necessary, if we earn our living on the street”.Mexico has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, at approximately 2.5 tests per confirmed case, compared with the US rate of 12.52, the UK’s 22.57 – and New Zealand’s rate of 359.2.Officials have admitted that lack of testing contributes to an undercounting of Covid cases and deaths, even in the country’s capital.But even as they were allowed to reopen, most of the Municipalities of Hope had not applied Covid tests.Nearly all of them were small, rural towns with limited transportation and health infrastructure, but the same factors that slowed the virus’s arrival also make it difficult to identify and treat Covid-19.Even in towns with hospitals, local health infrastructures do not guarantee a speedy testing response.“Here, they only test you if you have quite intense symptoms,” said Moreno Tavárez, who in May was tested at the local health center in Ometepec after experiencing Covid symptoms.“They take the tests from here all the way to Acapulco, and they only send you results if you are positive, leaving everyone else who is tested in suspense.”After several weeks of self-treatment, Moreno Tavárez recovered fully. He assumed he hadn’t had Covid. On 30 June he finally received a positive result.The town of Juchitán was the last in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero to maintain its status as a Municipality of Hope. In late June, cases were diagnosed in neighbouring towns – but by then life in the town had returned to normal, with open stores, schools and restaurants.“People are already careless about it,” said Edgar Liborio Huerta, who works as a construction company administrator in the town of roughly 2,000. “Very few people use face masks.”No Juchitán residents have yet been diagnosed with Covid-19 – not least because patients would have to go to a hospital either in Acapulco, about three hours away, or Ometepec, a 40-minute drive away, for testing.Nonetheless, there are rumours of covid deaths. Elizabeth Liborio Magaña, a Juchitán resident, said that a relative of her husband was one of the suspected cases. “He had asthma problems and they were acting up,” she said. “He got a fever and died of respiratory failure, but they haven’t said if it was because of covid.”To ward off their own outbreak, Juchitan’s authorities continue to take preventive measures. They cancelled the town’s patron saint festivals, usually held in July and August, which tend to attract visitors from all over the region.Meanwhile, the struggle between health and solvency continues. “We have to go back slowly to normal,” said Liborio Huerta. “It’s not because the pandemic is over, but because of the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ecd8944d05d77e5c09b1c7e367989d257a3a7d6/0_0_4917_2949/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3728327d9a335257e899046df7077af0","title":"thank you our glorious revolution activists react as sudan ditches islamist laws","story":"After 30 years under Omar al-Bashir, the country has abolished several discriminatory policies and banned FGM – in what activists have called ‘great first steps’ towards liberalisationSudan’s transitional government has been praised for its latest reforms, which decriminalise apostasy, ban female genital mutilation (FGM) and end the requirement for women to get travel permits.The legislation makes major strides in pushing back against discrimination faced by women and minorities during the 30-year rule of Omar al-Bashir that came to an end in 2019, according to equality advocates.The anti-torture charity Redress and the Sudan-based African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the measures “move Sudan a step closer towards eliminating structural violence against women and minorities”.“We encourage the new government to continue making domestic law and policy reforms until systematic torture is eradicated from the country and justice and reparations are fully realised for victims,” said Charlie Loudon, Redress’s international legal adviser.Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari announced last week that apostasy, which had been used against religious minorities and was punishable by death, would no longer be an offence. In addition, he said, non-Muslims will be allowed to drink alcohol in private.Abdulbari called the reforms “a big stride towards establishing one of the foundations for the victorious December revolution’s slogans, which is freedom”.Sudan’s infamous apostasy laws were highlighted by the case of Meriam Ibrahim, who was raised by a Christian mother, but sentenced to death by a Sudanese court for abandoning Islam, the faith of her father. Ibrahim was freed in 2018 after an international outcry.The reforms follow the abolition in late 2019 of the notorious Public Order Act. Article 152 of the law included the punishment of 40 lashes for women who wore trousers in public. Fagiri had previously claimed that 45,000 women were prosecuted under the Public Order Act in 2016 alone. Ola Diab, the editor of the online Sudanese cultural magazine 500 Words, said the reforms were “great first steps”.“The issue here is implementation of these laws. I think that’s where the challenge will be and where we’ll see if these laws will really bring serious change,” said Diab, noting that she expected social resistance to reforms such as the ban on FGM.She added that many other laws needed to change, including those that have seen victims of rape prosecuted on adultery charges and women in mixed-sex settings accused of prostitution.Loudon said Sudan must ensure steps are taken to enforce the legal changes.“That would be things like amending the internal policies of the relevant government agencies, whether the police, the general intelligence services or the armed forces.“The other thing that would be crucial would be training being put in place,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4369f17da2b8451f2664fc00df29f0ef9d1009ad/0_50_1379_827/master/1379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e92aea7617070ca123d0e4f6d124e80","title":"i was 18 hugged first time sister souljah activist","story":"I had grown up in brutal poverty, and saw touch as a privilege for those with less traumatic backgrounds. Then a friend and mentor changed my lifeWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesIt happened one day during my first year of college at Rutgers University, in my home state of New Jersey. The anti-apartheid movement was raging on my college campus, there was still a massive buzz about Jesse Jackson’s first run for president and I had instantly become woke, as we say, because of names such as Winnie and Nelson Mandela, because of the Aids and crack epidemics, and because of my adopted big sister on campus, an older student named Lisa Williamson, who would later become the famed activist and bestselling author Sister Souljah.For sure, Lisa was one of the most incredible speakers I had ever heard. She was a fearless leader, and I became so instantly fond of her, I even called her “Ma” just like I did my own mother. And she adored me, taught me and shared with me everything that she knew and was learning, in real time.On one of those many occasions we were together, as we were about to part ways, Lisa did something she had not done before: she leaned in to hug me goodbye and I recoiled with unimaginable terror, my body trembling. Lisa was stunned, asked me what was wrong, and I was profoundly embarrassed by my reaction. I said nothing.“You have never been hugged before, have you?”My 18-year-old eyes tumbled to the ground, along with my self-esteem. I felt weak, exposed and shook my head “no” so slightly that it could barely be seen.“Well, I am going to keep hugging you until you get used to it. You cannot live like that, Kev, afraid of people hugging or touching you.”And with that Lisa was gone, as I stood there still staring at the asphalt, my sweaty palms shoved deeply into my pockets.It was the first time I had been confronted about my fear of physical touch. I was raised by a single mother in brutal poverty, no father and no father-figure those first 18 years of my life, and my ma did the best she could with what she had. But there were no hugs, no kisses, no I love yous – never. The only touching I ever received from my mother were the severe beatings whenever I was “bad”, sometimes when I was awake, sometimes when I was asleep.This went on from birth until I was about 11 or 12 and finally taller than my mother. But the emotional and verbal assaults never ended. So somewhere in my mind I had come to associate touching with violence, with someone trying to hurt me, and it would take several years of therapy, and mighty and consistent spiritual work, for me to forgive my mother, to understand that she was simply doing to me what had been done to her by her father, by our society.Touching, hugging was a privilege reserved for those who had lives that were not traumatic like ours. Touching, hugging was for people who were “weird”, different, like the Puerto Rican kids I would observe from a distance at my Jersey City grammar school openly offering love and affection to each other. As a youth, I was stunned by their behaviour it was foreign to me, and I could not imagine someone, anyone, touching me.Yet little did I know that, in time, because of that singular act by Sister Souljah when I was 18, that I would fall in love with hugs, with touch.It would happen slowly, through my 20s and 30s, and into my 40s, this love of touch, of hugs. It would come as I would get over my dread of holding a girlfriend’s hand in public. It would come as I would learn, from a woman, from women, the difference between having sex and making love. It would come as I cried my eyes out in therapy session after therapy session over the course of three decades about the many traumas of my childhood. It would come to me as an activist, as a public speaker, when complete strangers would touch my shoulder, my elbow, my back, grab me, hug me, as a sign of appreciation. It comes when I try to touch my mother, on her shoulder, on her elbow, on her back, when I try to hug her as a sign of forgiveness and she recoils, as I had done long ago, with Sister Souljah but I keep trying, hoping, praying that my mother, in her late 70s now, will finally allow herself to be touched or hugged, with love.So here I am, sitting in my Brooklyn apartment, alone, during this pandemic, craving the presence and energy of human beings so intensely that it has left me in a flood of tears pretty much every single week.Touching is magic for the soul, it is healing. I ache badly now, as I did during the first 18 years of my life, because I do not have it, because I am just newly orced from my wife after 12 painful months of separation and loneliness. I will have touch again, this I know, but I wonder, daily, when? This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

And at Manchester City it’s been raised to another levelWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesThere is a shared ecstasy when the ball hits the back of the net – an unleashing of joy, passion, scarves and primal screams. You probably have nothing in common with your fellow huggers apart from supporting the same team and wearing identical replica shirts. In fact, you may dislike them in real life, and there is a good chance that you will never see them again. It is an extraordinary, unlikely bonding.But the Poznań is something else. Fans of the Polish club Lech Poznań introduced it to Manchester City supporters during a Europa League match in 2010. They turned their backs on the game, wrapped their arms around the shoulders of the supporters on either side of them and repeatedly jumped up and down on the spot in unison. It was a beautiful sight – random, surreal, rhythmic, funny, collective – and utterly senseless.The history of the Poznań is much debated. Some say it started in Poland in the early 60s as a protest by fans against club management others say it originated in Turkey and Greece, and was known as the Grecque. For Manchester City fans, though, it will always be known as the Poznań. After that match against Lech Poznań, we paid homage to its supporters by stealing their crazy hug-dance. We customised it by chanting “Let’s all do the Poznań” to the tune of Do the Conga.It was open to any number of meanings or none. We Poznańed in triumph after scoring, we Poznańed when we were bored, we Poznańed when we were rubbish. Turning our back on the football could be interpreted as supreme confidence (we knew we would win), despair (we knew we would lose) or indifference. Sod the footie, we were there for the craic. It was ludicrous, but it was also an act of love, trust and solidarity. A Poznań did not allow for party-poopers or mavericks (even though it was a maverick act). If one person broke the chain, the Poznań was ruined.Even pre-lockdown the football hug was in danger of disappearing. VAR (the video assistant referee) has taken the spontaneity out of football: rather than hugging when our team scored, we started checking the TV screens to see if a goal really was a goal or just another shattered hope.Meanwhile, the pandemic has robbed us of the opportunity to Poznań. Indeed, common sense may dictate that we never see it again. But football being football, and City fans being City fans, I have a sneaky feeling that when we are finally allowed back into football grounds, we may just celebrate with the most audacious, prolonged Poznań ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd4a87765f892fc784ccf95c7cf1fddd32028c7/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cf4eaf7ecd552d8c7ba318b627c20c","title":"rents rise in england but slide in london as covid 19 affects market","story":"Property website Rightmove said rents outside London hit record £845 a month in early JulyRents have continued to climb across England, but they are sliding in London as Airbnb owners abandon hopes of attracting holidaymakers and put their properties on the long-term rental market.The Rightmove data records asking prices for new properties to rent on its website, and is more volatile than figures from the Office for National Statistics.Rightmove director, Miles Shipside, said: “The pause in the rental market has led to some distorted figures over the past few months, especially in cities where landlords with short-term lets made the swap to instead try to find a long-term tenant.”He predicted that the legacy of coronavirus will be more tenants seeking a spare room and a garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c7fdb070b7277ccc22eb633bb21ff3fef299e1/0_1800_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8020aa6c5e1ea7c86a6b66731aeaeca7","title":"iconic festival sets nusrat fateh ali khan womad 1985","story":"Revellers on Essex’s Mersea Island were transfixed by the sheer spiritual power of Khan’s first performance outside south Asia, which marked a turning point in attitudes towards global musicNusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s voice is quite unlike any other. At turns heavy and hulkingly powerful, yet also nimble and pointedly precise, his vocalisations have come to epitomise not only the tradition of the Sufi qawwali but the art of singing itself.The qawwali is an Islamic devotional music designed to bring its performers and audience to a state of rapture and trance-like communion with the ine. Born of a 600-year-old line of qawwali singers, Khan’s grasp of music as a form of spiritual communication was acute. For the few thousand attendees at the Womad festival in 1985 witnessing Khan perform for the first time outside of south Asia, their experience would have been one of unexpected transcendence.Peter Gabriel had begun the festival only three years earlier as a western showcase of music from around the world, as well as that of his peers. The first edition, held in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet, saw performances by Gabriel, Indian sitar player Imrat Khan and free jazz trumpeter Don Cherry. Poor access to the festival site and low attendance almost sunk Womad in its first year, but a well-timed reunion concert for Gabriel’s old band Genesis kept them afloat.On the weekend of 19 July 1985, revellers travelled to the tiny Mersea Island in Essex for headliners New Order, the Fall and Toots and the Maytals. For the large majority, Khan would have been an obscure name – perhaps one mistakenly associated with the vastly different practice of the sitar raga popularised two decades earlier by Ravi Shankar.At midnight, after all the other performances had finished for the day, attendees witnessed Khan taking to the cramped, carpeted stage with his Party: nine members of his extended family of qawwali players, including his brother Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan on the harmonium. It was balmy and mercifully dry when promoter Muhammad Ayyub introduced them as “the most famous qawwal in the Indian subcontinent” before Farrukh’s harmonium gently piped in, playing the opening alap for Allah Ho. This 20-minute qawwal unfurls like one long crescendo, luring the listener in to its softly accelerating, swung beat of tablas and hand claps before suddenly Khan’s voice arrives.Listening to a recently digitised recording of the show now, it is still shocking in its force. Farrukh opens by singing along with his harmonium melody, yet Nusrat soon overtakes with a throaty, air-gulping yawp, leaping sideways into a high-register harmony. He leads the charge, the entire Party soon clapping in unison as he swaps phrases with child singer Kaukab Ali before they build to Khan’s signature sargam: a rapid-fire wordless vocalisation over chromatic scales in which Khan dances through melody like a bebop sax player through the pounding of drums.The Party follow that electric opening and rounds of applause with what would become one of Khan’s biggest commercial successes, Haq Ali Ali, a mid-tempo ode to the revered Sufi figure of the prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law. Then comes tabla player Dildar Hussain working up a polyrhythmic sweat during the raucous choral celebration of Shabhaz Qalandaz. Closing with a love song, or ghazal, Biba Sada Dil Morr De, Khan finds new gymnastic phrasings through the repetition of the song’s title, yearning as his husky voice cracks before each breath: “Give my heart back,” he entreats in Urdu.It is hard to overstate how important this concert was, not only for the assembled crowd, but Khan, too. After he had spent 14 years as the head of his family’s qawwal troupe, building a reputation as a religious performer in India and Pakistan, his Womad set brought him the secular fame and commercial viability of the western music industry. Here his music would inspire a new-age spiritualism of an entirely different kind.Months after Womad, Khan travelled to Paris where he made a series of beautiful live recordings for the Ocora label, as well as in London for the Indian music label Navras. In 1989, once Gabriel had founded his own Real World Records, Khan went on to release some of his most experimental and engaging albums under the imprint, such as 1990’s Mustt Mustt. In 1997, he died suddenly at the age of just 48.Khan’s 1985 Womad performance finds him at the raw prime of his talent. As the first generation of the British Asian community was coming of age and finding its own identity, so Khan’s alighting in the nation would have been a cultural lodestone a bridge to the past of their parents, as well as an acknowledgment of their diasporic present. It not only marked a turning point in attitudes towards global music in the UK, but among qawwal practitioners themselves. Until Khan started playing internationally, this music was considered a purely religious expression. The first of his many performances in secular environments helped transform this powerful, devotional form into an emblem of south Asian culture recognised around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c092ad79c010118e55babdca2b7c2213e962f03d/252_413_5047_3028/master/5047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88bbb369617ea2b97fb5ca751009dba5","title":"stars pick beethoven work they cherish proms","story":"Ali Smith does an opus a month, Tony Hall saw Fidelio on Robben Island, and Lady Brenda Hale used to march to his Grosse Fuge. As the Proms celebrate Beethoven’s 250th anniversary, stars reveal a favourite workAlan Hollinghurst, authorBeethoven is a master of compaction and urgency, and more than any other composer he writes startlingly moving fast music. The third movement of the Op 95 string quartet, “vivace ma serioso”, sums it up. I love this quartet for its intensity and compression, the absence of expected repeats which throws you into a “now or never” relationship with the material, and the gripping but mysterious drama of the whole thing. It may lack the aura of the late quartets, started 15 years later, but to me is just as breathtaking and indispensable.The piece I have to pick as my favourite is the Cavatina from the string Quartet, Op 130. It is possibly one of the greatest pieces of music ever. It is so modern and unexpected – you never know what he’s going to do next. The Medicis performed this at John’s memorial service in 2002. We had lots of funny things that day – there was an arrangement of The Sun Has Got His Hat On, which John would sing and dance to if things got edgy on set, and funny tributes – then suddenly there was this moment of utter beauty with this magical piece of music, something that was the soul of John.Music is a great comfort to me at the moment, while in isolation. I have Radio 3 on all the time and I desperately try not to listen to the news. On the night of Brexit, while some people were celebrating and others were having wakes, I stayed in and played Beethoven, his quartets mainly, into the small hours of the morning.I’ve been having spiritual talks recently with a fellow Quaker, trying to define what people call God. I would say that Beethoven’s late string quartets are the nearest to God that we’ll ever get. Their delicacy and intricacy and sheer beauty – can you believe this man was deaf when he wrote them?Kieran Hodgson, comedianIn the loneliest time of my life, Beethoven kept me company. A languages student, I was spending a year in Besançon, France, working and, improbably, living in a massive school known as “the factory”. Each evening, I was left to rattle around the deserted corridors like a ghost, until I discovered the cavernous salle polyvalente and its grand piano. At six o’clock sharp for three months I would sign out the key and spend an hour on the first movement of the Piano Sonata No 5 in C minor. Arpeggio target practice galore, a great party piece – and a much-needed friend.Laura Wade, playwrightI first came across the Violin Sonata, Op 47, the “Kreutzer”, when asked by the Australian Chamber Orchestra to write a play to be performed alongside it, taking inspiration from Tolstoy’s 1889 novella The Kreutzer Sonata. It was love at first listen. In Tolstoy’s novella, a husband suspects his wife, a talented amateur pianist, of having an affair with the violinist with whom she is playing the Kreutzer. Driven mad by the music, he murders her in a jealous rage.The story is queasily fascinated by the power of music to arouse passion, and when listening to the piece you can sense where the husband’s suspicions come from. Just as we endlessly speculate over the chemistry between highly skilled actors playing a love scene, it’s hard not to read the dialogue between the violin and piano parts as an expression of a deeper synchronicity. We are eavesdropping on the best kind of conversation, between two people who are high on each other – riffing off each other’s ideas, each taking the other one’s phrase, turning it around and sending it back brighter each time, building and building.It’s famously difficult to perform – I imagine it brings the players out in a sweat. The violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, to whom the sonata was dedicated, called it “outrageously unintelligible” and refused to perform it. I’m glad other musicians have been less squeamish because I would happily be transported by this piece every day.Beethoven String Quartet in A minor, Op 132 – written in 1825 after he recovered from a nearly fatal intestinal disorder – is my favourite because of its strange third movement. Marked molto adagio, it is about 20 minutes long (depending on your recording) and alternates between slow funereal sections in the key of F and joyful fast movements in D marked “Neue Kraft Fuhlend”, or “feeling new strength”. It is these unexpected leaps of regrowth coming out of the slow sad sections that always fill me with possibility if I am feeling low. A study in hope.Timberlake Wertenbaker, playwrightIt’s very difficult to choose a favourite piece by Beethoven. One of the late quartets? The “Ghost” trio? I have a particular fondness for the Choral Fantasy, especially the end, because it’s so wild and full of hope, and because Beethoven first played it himself and apparently improvised some of it.In the end, my favourite Beethoven has to be Fidelio. An opera set in a prison that is about a political prisoner incarcerated for wanting to reveal corruption has a very contemporary resonance. The heroine is active, intelligent and doesn’t even have to die in the end. It has passages of aching beauty, the finale of course, and earlier on, a brief moment when the prisoners come up into the air and are able “to breathe again”. Apt words, especially these days.Ragnar Kjartansson, artistThe Seventh Symphony, the Allegretto in the second movement comes to mind immediately. It sounds like death and life and love and everything in between! I first heard it at an afterparty in Reykjavík many years ago. Among the much younger people hanging out at the bar was an old man, too. He invited everyone to his home, where he played the Allegretto on a 1960s stereo for us all. It was dramatic and powerful and just so beautiful – I loved it immediately. The movement is a crazy memento mori, it has this curve of longing in it. I also like that you can really hear Handel’s Sarabande in it – it’s almost like a remix of it. I don’t have a favourite recording – I’m not enough of a connoisseur that I can hear nuances of interpretation. Besides, you can’t screw this piece up.Ali Smith, authorI spent a lot of my life believing classical music wasn’t really for me. Then about a decade ago I began listening to a piece of Beethoven every day. I’d heard pieces and been astonished as modernist as Frank Gehry architecture, as timeless as things dug up in Greece from millennia ago, as uncompromising as history, as inventive and colourful as Picasso and Hockney. But I’d no idea where to start. So I began at Opus 1, listened to it every day for a month, then Opus 2 the next month. And so on.It’s not a real chronology, but it gave me a way in, has introduced me to a lot of Beethoven that isn’t commonly listened to, and it’s never not been enlightening, exciting, and a fusion of pleasure and meditation – your mind opens and dimensionalises as you listen, whatever it is, it’ll be layered with an understanding of societal negotiation and of the heft, the shadow and the forward push of time.Right now I’m on Op 117, the overture to Konig Stephan, with its formal double-take, its suggestion of time slippage. My favourites over the decade? The piano sonatas. The piano concertos. The symphonies. (I’m looking forward to a month with the Ninth.) And The Creatures of Prometheus. Life, joy.Es Devlin, artist and set designerMy first encounter with Beethoven was in a community centre in Hastings, sitting at the back of the second violin section in the town’s youth orchestra. My mum would drive me and my sister the 12 miles from Rye every Tuesday night. It was usually dark at 5pm and mainly raining, windscreen wipers going full pelt – and in my memory we always practised the Egmont Overture.I was not the most virtuosic violin player, but I loved being part of a collective sound. I could never quite fathom how my scratched bowing could meld with everyone else’s contribution to become this overwhelming surround-sound that seemed to be so much greater and more magnificent than the sum of all of our wet Hastings Tuesday-night souls.My most recent encounter with Beethoven was on another rainy night on a rooftop carpark in Peckham, the site of Hannah Barry’s Bold Tendencies art project. We had edited theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli’s The Order of Time into a 24-minute large-scale digital artwork. Part of Carlo’s text invokes the painfully beautiful lead violin part in Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis Benedictus, and our composers, Polyphonia, had extracted the solo violin and reset it to accompany the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch reading Rovelli’s meditation on time. In this context, as 2,000 of us including Carlo himself stood on a south London rooftop reading his profound text on the nature of time, beneath the relentless downpour, Beethoven’s music felt almost excruciatingly moving.Tony Hall, director general BBCIn 2004 I went to South Africa to see Cape Town Opera mark 10 years of democracy with a production of Fidelio on Robben Island. I had the privilege of being guided around by former ANC prisoners before the performance and was shown the cell where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years in captivity. It’s always a tricky opera, but as night fell, against the backdrop of a spectacular sunset, the prisoners emerged singing that famous chorus on to a stage set in the real-life prison courtyard. It was unforgettably moving – a celebration of hope and liberation in the most powerful setting possible.Michael Craig-Martin, artistI first heard Beethoven’s Late Quartets at the 92nd Street Y in New York in 1960 when I was a student. I love the clarity and intimacy of chamber music because one can “see” the music being made, and can focus on the contribution of each musician and instrument to the ensemble. The Late Quartets were found unintelligible and dismissed at the time, but proved to be prophetic about the future development of music. They are filled with emotion and the experience of a lifetime. I hear their sadness more clearly now, particularly at this time, than I did at 20.Lady Brenda Hale, former president of the Supreme CourtTwo of Beethoven’s works mean something special to me. One is his Grosse Fuge: a magnificent striding fugue that I used to march round my college room in time to, learning my notes for the Cambridge Law Tripos. The other is his only opera, Fidelio. I first saw this in the Vienna Opera House, a suitably grand setting for a great operatic experience. It is a passionate attack on injustice, autocratic and unaccountable power, and secret prisoners, conquered by the power of the love of a wonderful and courageous woman. My favourite is the vocal quartet Mir ist so wunderbar, four completely incompatible views of what is going on, intricately woven together.Edmund de Waal, artist and authorBeethoven’s Grosse Fuge in B flat major, Op 133 of 1826, was “incomprehensible, like Chinese” according to the critics of the time. It was “a confusion of Babel”. There were passages that could be understood but seemed to have no structure, no development. It was genius in ruins. It was chaotic, angry, complex. Sylvia Plath in her poem Little Fugue on her father and death writes of “The yew hedge of the Grosse Fuge”, a deep and dark and forbidding barrier: “He could hear Beethoven:  Black yew, white cloud,  The horrific complications.  Finger-traps—a tumult of keys.” Lateness needs a response, an understanding of how much is left to achieve. Beethoven’s lateness is powerful because it does not seek resolution. This is why I return to it again and again.Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National GalleryA few weeks after the beginning of the second world war, Kenneth Clark, the director of the National Gallery, asked the pianist Myra Hess to organise some musical concerts in the empty rooms, the pictures having been removed for safekeeping. The very first concert she gave was – perhaps surprisingly for us – almost entirely Germanic music, and included one of Hess’s favourite works, Beethoven’s “Appassionata” sonata. This is a big showy piece (the F minor key allowed Beethoven to use the entire range of the keyboard from the very bottom note) it is difficult, brooding, brilliant and passionate as its (later) title indicates. Clark said that as she played the opening bars: “It was an assurance that all our sufferings were not in vain.” The story of how these lunchtime concerts helped keep up Londoners’ spirits as the bombs rained down is enduringly inspiring.The Grosse Fuge is still absolutely shocking, almost like contemporary music to anybody and it’s always going to sound modern. Every great composer since then has always remarked on that characteristic and for me it also exemplifies Beethoven the human being, that he never accepted the status quo and he always struggled. Let’s not forget that he was virtually penniless for most of his life and that he did what he believed in rather than what was expected, and for me this piece exemplifies the essence of his personality. He never loses contact with the idea that music is the expression in sound of human life, and human life can be shocking, and in this piece he shocks us, but also gives us moments of great tenderness and beauty.• The Proms begins on 17 July on Radio 3 and on the Proms website with a Beethoven weekend including great Proms performances of his music.

They achieved this despite most countries in the world suffering their worst economic contractions in decades. Some 24 of the family offices in the survey managed private fortunes of more than $3bn.Josef Stadler, head of UBS’s ultra-high net worth unit, said the world’s richest people had been able to increase their fortunes during the crisis because they had enough money to “embrace and manage risk like no other investor”.“They stick to their plans, even when market volatility makes it uncomfortable. They hold their position. They are disciplined,” Stadler said. “It is missing an opportunity that gives these clients the biggest headache, not making a short-term loss.”The rising fortunes of the super-wealthy come as separate research shows that it is the poorest people in society who are mostly likely to be losing their jobs and suffering the biggest percentage fall in income.Ana Arendar, head of inequality campaigns at Oxfam, said: “Whilst those with great wealth are able to reallocate their investments to insulate themselves from the economic impacts of Covid-19, most poor people in developing and developed countries cannot take similar action to protect their limited wealth.“Wealth inequalities were already too high before the crisis and action is needed to ensure the gap does not grow further.”Family offices – which were pioneered by the Rockerfeller family in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations – are also used by wealthy people to run homes and staff across the world and to look after private jets, super-yachts and other accoutrements.The number of super-rich people continues to grow despite the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person and the founder of Amazon, has seen his fortune swell by $75bn so far this year to a record $189bn.More than 500,000 people in the world are classed as “ultra-wealthy”, with fortunes of more than $30m (£26.5m). That means there are more ultra-wealthy people than the populations of Iceland, Malta or Belize.This week, a group of more than 80 millionaires called on governments permanently to increase taxes on them and other members of the wealthy elite to help pay for the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64853270418239725248e64d757ab564f4497d8/0_50_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e6f817deaebb90bc3d07aa622b7af","title":"is uk golden era relations china over podcast","story":"China and the UK have clashed in recent months over a draconian new security law in Hong Kong and the Chinese tech company Huawei. ’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment. That has all changed after China imposed a harsh new security law in Hong Kong and now the UK government is preparing to backtrack on an agreement to use the Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G infrastructure.  ’s leader writer Tania Branigan tells Rachel Humphreys that this new phase in relations is going to be difficult for the UK. Last week, Beijing’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, warned: “China wants to be UK’s friend and partner. But if you treat China as a hostile country, you would have to bear the consequences.” It comes as pressure mounts on China internationally to be open about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic first seen in Wuhan at the end of last year, and increasing outrage at the treatment of Uighur Muslims. But there is an acceptance too in government that even if the ‘golden era’ is over, China remains a vital trade relationship as well as a crucial player in global affairs, not least the battle to reduce carbon emissions.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

There’s much to savour from a life, and football career, well lived. Starting with his honour-filled Leeds years, which he also discusses here with Jeff Stelling alongside Paul Reaney and Norman Hunter, including the tale of his first England call-up. His finest hour in an England shirt, of course, came in 1966. More achievements followed as a manager, at Middlesbrough, for whom key figures pay tribute here, and at Sheffield Wednesday, whom he also led to promotion.Honorary Irish citizenship ensued after he then took the Republic to unprecedented heights, first at the 1988 European Championships – when they beat England and Ronnie Whelan scored this sensational goal against the Soviet Union – and then at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. So you’ll be wanting Packie Bonner’s save in Genoa and Ray Houghton’s fairytale of New York then. At Italia 90, Charlton’s team also met the Pope, which he chats about to Colm Meaney here. Four years later, Ireland reached the knockout stages again though not without some losses of temper. And finally, Fathers Ted and Dougal pay their tribute.2) “That cannot be right …” – Noah Lyles’s 200m world record that wasn’t.3) After months of idleness and frustration, club cricket finally returned last weekend in all its varied glory, so here’s a couple of nuggets of the ridiculous and the sublime, the latter with added umpire commentary.4) Today is the 70th anniversary of the famous “Maracanazo”, Uruguay’s 1950 World Cup final triumph over Brazil in Rio, to the dismay of a record crowd of 199,000 at the Maracanã.5) They’re rattling through the races now Formula 1 has returned, and this weekend we’re at the Hungaroring for the Hungarian Grand Prix. The race was first run in 1936 but it made history when the 1986 edition was the first held in the old Eastern Bloc. Nelson Piquet took the victory, pipping Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell to top place on the podium. In recent times it has been dominated by Lewis Hamilton, who first won in Hungary in 2007 and became the most successful driver in the circuit’s history with his seventh win in the race last year.6) Don’t look down.1) Relaxing on the couch – or perhaps not.2) The art of the juke, as demonstrated by a selection of NFL and college players.3) Last week’s Ennio Morricone-inspired discussion of World Cup 1978 music prompts an argument in favour of the BBC’s theme for the tournament.4) IndyCar restart bedlam, featuring pile-ups, inappropriate hand gestures and more.5) A Japanese-language documentary about Shunsuke Nakumura’s time at Celtic, featuring a visit to a young Kieran Tierney’s house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9cae18939e04107e28cb22dd7512ec89903c4a/0_116_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d82b6a84b015feebd3553e4b5b6d1e2","title":"from family holidays to suburban commutes why a hybrid suv makes sense","story":"SUVs don’t have to be the imposing gas-guzzlers we often think of them as. For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f79da44d8a0ece6279b5b367a3c891969238286/0_27_5641_3384/master/5641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b40ded8ed46288a9e99afe1d7162254","title":"10 of the uks best hidden destinations readers travel tips","story":"From Scotland’s most easterly Munro mountain to a remote ‘Greek’ beach in Devon, readers nobly share their knowledge of lovely, but little-visited spotsPenmon is a quiet village on the south-east tip of Anglesey, on the coastal footpath and cycling routes, near a wide sandy beach.

My favourite section is that nearing its western end at Crinan itself, a small village with a tea shopgallery and hotel. You can walk or cycle along the towpath (experiencing the weirdness of a canal running above sea level), watch yachts coming through the locks, head up into the forests and maybe see the reintroduced beavers at Loch Barnluasgan, or just relax and enjoy the views out towards Jura and Mull. It’s a special place, where taking things slowly comes easily.MaryHikers intent on climbing Scotland’s most easterly munro, Mount Keen, above Glen Esk, all miss out on a far quieter beauty spot nearby. A circuitous route around Loch Lee and the smaller summit of Cairn Lick is a far more rewarding walk. The walk takes in the length of the loch, passes by the beautiful Falls of Unich (pictured) and climbs up an impressive gully. On the descent you get views to one side of a lochan hidden from those at ground level and, looking forward, a sweeping vista of Loch Lee stretches down the glen. An inviting prospect for a cool down dip on a hot summer’s day. All this and rarely anyone else to share it with.DebbieDavid Balfour’s Bay is a remote and breathtaking sandy bay with clear turquoise waters and pristine white sands in a stunning setting – the tidal Isle of Erraid, near Mull on Scotland’s Atlantic Coast. On a clear day, you could imagine you were in Barbados. To reach the bay, walk across Erraid from Knockvologan Beach at low tide. This scenic walk can be extended to explore the north side of Erraid where there are magnificent views of the Sound of Iona. Just be careful of tides so you don’t get caught there – a swim back would be invigorating!Peter RileyDewstow Gardens in Monmouthshire were only rediscovered in 2000 after being buried in tonnes of soil after the second world war and make a stunning place to visit for an afternoon. There are little nooks everywhere – ponds, rockeries, grottoes. It reminds me of The Secret Garden. There are a few great hotels near it also if you want to make a weekend of it.• Reopened last weekend, takeaway refreshments only, adult £7.50, 6-10s £2.50, 11-18s £4.50, under-5s free, family £24Joanne SkidmoreThe Rhinog hills east of Harlech are wild, heather- and wood-covered beauties that, from the north, offer stunning views across Cardigan bay, and fabulous walking. They feel remote in that you might only meet feral goats on your path, but within minutes you can drop down to the coast, for example, to the morfa (marsh) and beach at Harlech or Shell Island, or to the pretty stone-hewn Ty-Mawr pubhotel in Llanbedr. We stayed in the Laundry Cottage in Dyffryn Ardudwy close to the Cwm Nantcol campsite.RuthDon’t go to the castle in Falmouth, lovely as it is. Instead, park in the Pendennis Head car park (no charge), then follow the footpath down to the east and eventually you’ll access the hidden coves reached off the coast path. With a bit of luck you’ll have a cove to yourself, although you might have to share with a grey seal or two. Then the scene is set for sunbathing, swimming, rockpooling and snorkelling. Remember to check the tide times, and keep on eye on the incoming water … Otherwise this is the perfect spot for relaxation.JaneKnown as Devon’s Greek beach, Broadsands beach in Ilfracombe is a pretty cove reached down over 300 steep steps that help keep the crowds away even on a warm summer weekend. The hidden beach is backed by cliffs and is best at low tide, with great views towards Combe Martin Bay. To get there, find the coast path behind the Sandy Cove hotel and look out for a wooden signpost among the trees to your right. For a good view of the beach, stay on the coast path a little further until you reach a caravan park and a well-positioned bench with a stunning view from above.Sidra Nawaz This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

In the past 24 hours, there have been 140 new coronavirus-related deaths.These grim records come as Los Angeles and San Diego school districts, two of the state’s largest, made the decision to go online-only through the fall, and the virus ripped through California’s prison system, prompting the state to release up to 8,000 prisoners in an effort to curb the spread.On Monday Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, ordered all bars to shut and all restaurants, movie theaters and museums to halt indoor operations. “It’s incumbent on all of us to recognize, soberly, that Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon,” he said in his press briefing.“We were able to suppress the spread of this virus. We were able to knock down the growth of this at the beginning. We’re going to do that again,” Newsom said. “There’s no doubt in my mind.”Case numbers continue to climb around the US, which has so far recorded more than 3.4m cases and more than 137,000 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins. States including Florida and Texas have also recently set their own records for daily new infections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe4c177ac196e0d48d468fc616fd7c39f49fd8b/19_0_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3bb927a30416adddf615be41a38525","title":"democrats joe biden nervously optimistic blue wave","story":"Joe Biden is polling well ahead of Donald Trump, potentially putting more states in play – but complacency has been banishedLess than four months out from the November election, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been consistently polling ahead of Donald Trump.The president’s approval numbers remain underwater, and Democrats believe they can seriously compete in traditionally red states including Texas, as Trump faces sustained criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis linked to it, as well as the ongoing anti-racism protests against police brutality.For Democrats, these are not the only indicators that things are going well. Infighting between the progressive wing of the party and the establishment wing has been relatively minimal, as they come together to focus on Biden’s campaign to push Trump out of the White House.Some top party officials are feeling ambitious, and want to ride another potential “blue wave” to try to win races that are usually out of reach in states like Georgia and Ohio. But there’s a strain of caution running through the Democratic party as well. Things looked great for them for a while in 2016, too, but Republicans ended up with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and the memory of that cataclysmic loss is still fresh.“I mean, we are emotionally and mentally scarred in such a way that we are not going to feel comfortable until a week after Biden is sworn in,” said the Democratic strategist Tom Bowen.In any election cycle, campaign officials use cautious phrases like “we’re not leaving anything to chance” or “campaigning like we’re 10 points down until election day” – and the 2020 presidential race is no different. But coupled with that is an argument that Trump’s case for re-election is not reaching the voters he needs to.The memo went on to tick off the problems with each of Trump’s arguments.On Tuesday, in another sign that Democrats see a rare opening to compete in what are usually Republican strongholds, the Biden campaign began airing a 60-second general election ad in Texas, fueled by a six-figure ad buy. That ad is the first in a $15m multi-state blitz in six battleground states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Meanwhile, the pro-Trump America First Action Super Pac is pouring $23m into Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin but not Michigan – a state that Trump needs to win re-election. Trump himself has been campaigning over the last few months in reliably red states. Private polling for Republicans also shows the president in trouble in what are usually reliably conservative states.All of which suggests Democrats have the upper hand over Republicans. But Democratic state officials and operatives expect polls to tighten and the summer high to end. In multiple interviews, these officials were hopeful but also realistic that the next few months won’t be easy.Democrats often cite 2016, where polls showed Hillary Clinton as the clear favorite to win the presidency. At that time, and again now, some Democrats also felt retaking control of the Senate was possible.“I’m not going to argue that there isn’t some anxiety there, and I think that 2016 put that in our being because we were feeling very secure that we would have a Democratic president, and things changed so rapidly,” said the Kansas Democratic party chairwoman, Vicki Hiatt.Democrats are hoping to win a US Senate seat in Kansas this cycle, which would usually be unheard of. “I think over the past three and a half years we’ve seen some very unpredictable things happen that we would never have expected. I think that is where that anxiety comes from. For me personally, I’m not going to rest until we have this thing done. I’m cautiously optimistic but I’m not taking anything for granted.”From September, Biden and Trump will face each other in three televised debates, something Republican campaign officials hope the president will be able to dominate. Democrats are also expecting some kind of “October surprise” from the Trump campaign and a barrage of warnings about Democratic control of the White House and Congress.“That tightening will happen. It’s natural. So what we need to be doing is building up our reserves now,” said the Maryland Democratic party chairwoman, Yvette Lewis. “So we can’t waste time right now worrying about the what-ifs.”The Tennessee Democratic party chairwoman, Mary Mancini, said that Republicans have not yet thrown their full offensive force against Democratic candidates this cycle.“Now what they could do and what they’re trying to do is fearmonger their way into winning,” Mancini said. “I think the most damaging and frightening thing is we have yet to see the all-out assault from the Republican party in terms of using fear to motivate voters. We’ve seen a little of it but it’s the tip of the iceberg for the Republican party.”The pandemic has also changed the reality of campaigning for office. More voters will be voting by mail rather than in person, potentially delaying the final results on election night. Trump has argued, contrary to established evidence, that voting by mail is vulnerable to fraud.“I think my greatest fear is what the Republicans do now and over the next few months to delegitimise the election,” said Aryeh Alex, the executive director of the Ohio Democrats’ state house campaign arm.Julian Mulvey, a veteran Democratic ad maker, added: “Every Democrat should be worried. Every Democrat should be nervous because it won’t be over till it’s over. But I think everyone is nervously optimistic right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d8c2e5b71081b487018d28e168d6f0c87dfdfc1/0_0_2604_1562/master/2604.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7daa2d23a904d5a1e524a4041e452db3","title":"the day bristol woke up to a new statue","story":"City responds to guerrilla installation of sculpture inspired by the day the Colston statue fellWhen Bristol went to bed on Tuesday night, the question was theoretical: what should replace the toppled statue of the slave trader Edward Colston?When it woke up, the answer was concrete – or, at least, resin and steel. Just before 5am, a team directed by the artist Marc Quinn had swiftly and almost silently installed a sculpture of a Black Lives Matter activist, Jen Reid, and driven away.Shortly after the vehicles left, a gaggle of photographers surrounded Reid, who stood with her fist in the air, echoing the picture from the day Colston fell that had inspired the piece.“It’s just incredible,” she said of the artwork that felt like an ambush. “That’s pretty fucking ballsy, that it is.”But in offering an answer to one problem, Quinn and Reid presented Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, with another one. The installation of the new statue, unsanctioned by the council, was not how the Colston conundrum was supposed to be resolved, Rees told the local community radio station BCfm a couple of hours later.“The subject matter is powerful, a local voice, a remarkable woman being represented,” he said. “All that is fantastic. But Bristol is a very delicately balanced city. A fractured city. So the process is really important, and this hasn’t really worked with the process.”Despite Rees’s reservations, the statue of Reid – titled “A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020” – now had the same advantage that the Colston one had held for more than a century: it was there.“It almost feels like it’s been there forever,” said Quinn. “It gets under the skin before you understand what it is.”And, as the Colston case proved, the criteria for taking down a public sculpture turn out to be very different to those for putting it up.Reid, a Bristolian, said it had been difficult to keep the secret from friends and family. “When friends say ‘I’ll see you later’, I think … yeah, you will!”Her daughter Leila, Gazing up at her mother’s avatar a little later, shook her head and laughed. “It is incredible seeing it,” she said. “It’s surreal. From the kneecap to the shape of her hands - it’s just her.”She said the statue was the right answer to the Colston problem, at least for now. “She’s proud to represent a movement, and if there’s a better way to do that, I can’t think of it.”The police quickly concluded that no crime had been committed and the statue’s future was a matter for the council. The only official figure in sight was the driver of a road sweeper, who stopped to take a picture before continuing with his shift. Meanwhile, double-taking passersby and those who had heard the news stopped and stared throughout the day.“It’s beautiful, and it’s really powerful,” said Shani Ackford, a speech therapist, who had come to see it with her young son. “It’s the right thing to represent how it came down.”Sanna Bertilsson stopped on her bike to get a picture “before they take it down”.Others were much less convinced, voicing concerns that a work by an established white artist had occupied a space created by black activism. Rees noted that Quinn was a “London-based artist”.Quinn said it was Reid who had “created the sculpture when she stood on the plinth and raised her arm in the air”, and that his role had simply been to “crystallise it”.Thomas J Price, who has been commissioned to create a sculpture dedicated to the Windrush generation, said he understood the “initial positive reactions” but called it a “votive statue to appropriation”.Reid, for her part, took the opposite view, though she also expressed her sympathy for Rees. “It’s a demonstrable commitment to the cause of Black Lives Matter in that it shows active allyship,” she said. “Isn’t this what we need? Allies?”Whatever the answer to that question, the council had a more immediate concern about safety. It sent a structural engineer to assess the installation, and was waiting for their report on Wednesday evening.Quinn and his team said they had gone through exactly the same safety assessment that they would have done on a commissioned piece. The artist said it was “not a permanent artwork”, but it had been placed in such a way that it would be “extremely difficult to move”.All the same, by the afternoon Rees had declared that the statue “will have to be removed”.In the long term, the decision on Colston’s successor will reflect the conclusions of a specially appointed history commission – and, Rees was at pains to say, aim to accommodate even the “people do not get what they want”, so that they know “they live in a city that is their one and respects them.”But Quinn argued that there was scope for a more urgent statement, too. “There are different speeds for different kinds of response,” he said. “If I’m in a position to put something like this up quickly, while the conversation is happening, there’s a duty to do it.”By the end of the day, it seemed that the statue was going nowhere just yet.As to what kind of question Bristol will wake up to on Thursday, no one could say. “Once you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more,” Quinn said. “I would encourage all artists to take the public realm into their hands, and do things to activate it. We put it there, and now it has its own life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868e6357cba7478d81767fe14e501467a97a3281/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953c424f82cdd9569fcbdd3aa47b8b40","title":"angela merkel set for central role in talks on eu recovery plan","story":"Germany has foot in both camps as leaders try to agree on rescue package and seven-year budgetWhen Angela Merkel attended her first EU summit as Germany’s chancellor, in 2005, she joined Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and leaders from central and eastern Europe that had joined the bloc only 17 months earlier. Nearly 15 years later, Merkel is the EU’s longest-serving leader and seen as the key to unlocking a deal to help Europe face the worst economic slump forecast in its history.When EU leaders sit down together on Friday and Saturday, it will be their first face-to-face meeting since the pandemic struck. On the table is a €750bn (£680bn) draft recovery plan, as well as a proposed €1.074tn EU budget for the next seven years. Getting a deal on the budget will be fiendishly difficult as the EU attempts to square the circle of more spending on the environment, security and health and the €75bn shortfall caused by Brexit.Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said Merkel would play a crucial role both because she was “so respected for her work” and because Germany was taking a middle position in the recovery plan, giving it a foot in both camps.She said Germany had “a very strong commitment … to really invest heavily in the recovery of the EU,” but demands from northern countries to link funds to economic reform were “something that is very close to the German heart as well”.Optimistic officials are encouraged by the coincidence that Germany took on the EU council’s rotating presidency on 1 July, amid sniping about the performance of the leaders of EU institutions. Charles Michel, the European council president, tasked with brokering a compromise, has been criticised by some for his handling of budget talks. “He is still paralysed by the failure of the European council in February,” said one senior EU diplomat.An EU official responded that Michel had fully prepared for that February summit, but the task had not been easy as some EU leader were unprepared to compromise. “Since then we have had a global pandemic landing on our doorstep and the world has changed completely.”Germany opened the way to a recovery plan with its own political conversion, enshrined in the deal Merkel struck with France’s Emmanuel Macron for a fund based on grants to countries hardest hit by coronavirus. Pierre Sellal, who spent a decade as France’s most senior diplomat in Brussels, said Merkel had crossed two of Germany’s traditional red lines “The first, no deficits, no common borrowing. And secondly, no transformation of the rules underpinning in the single currency, no budgetary transfers.”The Germany presidency could crystallise a consensus, he said. “Now we are at a very particular moment, the stakes are very high.”Germany’s readiness to accept large-scale EU borrowing contrasts with the stance Merkel took during the eurozone debt crisis, when she stood firmly against a transfer union. The German government “realised that its own approach doesn’t allow the necessary convergence and cohesion in the EU,” said Schwarzer, who highlighted the role of Germany’s Social Democrat finance minister, Olaf Scholz, as architect of the policy shift. Schwarzer said Germany’s change of heart was “not out of some kind of abstract idea of solidarity – but it’s really in Germany’s self-interest to do so.”Since Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the US – two hammer blows to the European project – all EU leaders have become more aware of their economic interdependence and the risks of the European single market unravelling. “Thanks to Brexit … suddenly the leaders say we will defend the single market,” said a second senior EU diplomat, who also cited Trump and tensions in the EU-China relationship. As political frost descends on global trade, what was once seen as Germany’s strength, its export-led economy, suddenly looked more like a vulnerability.Merkel’s change of heart has weakened the “frugal four”, a quartet of northern European states that want less EU spending and more budget discipline. For months, Germany had been perceived as an unofficial member. Now they stand more isolated.But EU officials caution that Germany’s policy shift is not enough for agreement, as the frugal four continue to insist on tough conditions for loans that southern European governments reject as unacceptable. “Even having the Franco-German proposal is not always helpful, said one official. “We are playing chess on many different levels.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, shop steward of the frugal four, said on Tuesday he was “not hopeful” of a deal.The other big obstacle comes from the leader second only to Merkel in years running his country: Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s prime minister is resisting plans to tie the disbursement of EU funds to the rule of law, a key demand for western European governments alarmed about the weakening of democratic checks and balances in Hungary. Orbán got a symbolic boost from lawmakers in his Fidesz party this week who passed a resolution declaring that EU funds should not be linked to “political or ideological conditions – under the label of rule of law”.Solving this political Rubik’s cube is now bound up with the political legacy of the German chancellor, who told MEPs this month: “The top priority in the Germany presidency will be unity in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/097a85a66960898b0a6617e622572a8d8f785ac3/7_0_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=205c7778b04cf4fd00913563cafaa79b","title":"black lives matter sculpture of jen reid removed colston  bristol","story":"The sculpture of protester has been taken to a museum for artist Marc Quinn to collect, says Bristol city councilThe sculpture of a Black Lives Matter protester that replaced a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol has been removed just 24 hours after it went up.Contractors were pictured using ropes and a crane to secure the statue of Jen Reid, who had been photographed standing on the plinth with a raised fist on the day the figure of Colston was removed, at about 5.20am on Thursday morning.A witness said that the workmen carefully secured the strap before moving the Marc Quinn sculpture, with one saying “don’t break her dress”. It was then lifted into a recycling and skip hire lorry and driven away.A Bristol city council spokeswoman said: “This morning we removed the sculpture. It will be held at our museum for the artist to collect or donate to our collection.”BBC Bristol reported that Quinn would be charged with the cost of the removal and that the council said it had received complaints of fly-tipping.Reid and Quinn have said that any proceeds from the sale of the work will go to two charities chosen by Reid that are devoted to improving the teaching of black history in British schools.The black resin and steel statue, entitled A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, was put up without the council’s knowledge shortly before 5am on Wednesday by a team under the direction of Quinn. He had said it was not intended to be in place permanently.Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the city was going through an “incredibly delicate time”.“This is not about taking down a statue of Jen, who is a very impressive woman,” Rees said.“This is about taking down a statue of a London-based artist who came and put it up without permission.”Rees said when he spoke to Quinn, the artist was unaware that after the toppling of the Colston statue the grave of Scipio Africanus - a memorial to an enslaved African man – had been vandalised. A message left in chalk near the site read: “Put Colston’s statue back or things will really heat up.”“If you’re going to do something, you need to do it with awareness and a full knowledge of the context in which you’re doing it,” Rees said.The statue of Colston had stood for more than a century, prompting some social media users to say that the council should have allowed the statue of Reid to remain in place for longer before bringing it down.Tim Burns, a charity worker, said: “Some days I wake up a feel proud to live in Bristol. Other days I feel like we missed the point? The Jen Reid statue didn’t need to be permanent but after procrastinating for years over whether to take down Colston removing this after 24 hours feels unnecessary.”The author Bernadine Evaristo tweeted: “Now it has to find a public spot. If Bristol doesn’t have the guts, I nominate Brixton.”Police said on Thursday that no offence had been committed and the statue’s future was a matter for the council. Most passersby in Bristol appeared to approve of the addition to the plinth, with many taking selfies raising a fist in front of it.There was some tension last night when a group arrived to say the statue should come down, prompting others on the scene to take a knee.Before the statue came down, Reid and Quinn both said that they viewed its future as being a matter for others to decide. “Whether it’s there for a day or a week or a month, it’s been there,” Reid said.Quinn said that “once you make an artwork, you have no control over it any more”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18fde270d2974279aa347d8d27f3cc0e62ded6d/73_138_872_523/master/872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b666b2b45dc051c9ed3ad4e85ff5b09","title":"dutch city ends ties with polish twin declared gay free zone nieuwegein pulawy","story":"Nieuwegein council votes to end links to Puławy, which has vowed to discourage tolerance A Dutch city has severed its longstanding ties with its twin in Poland after the Polish municipality established itself as an official “gay-free zone”.The city council of Nieuwegein, south of Utrecht, voted almost unanimously to end its friendship with Puławy in eastern Poland.The municipality 80 miles from Warsaw is one of 100 that have vowed to discourage tolerance and avoid providing financial assistance to NGOs working to promote equal rights.“LGBT-free zones”, backed by resolutions voted on by local councillors, are said by equality campaigners to cover about a third of Poland.Following the decision by councillors in Nieuwegein to vote by 26-1 to terminate the relationship, stickers with a rainbow flag were placed on one of the city’s entrance signs to cover up its Polish counterpart’s name.“Setting the gay-free zones is a serious business and our council has issued a very clear statement that this is not acceptable,” said the Dutch city’s alderman, Marieke Schouten. “We are a rainbow city. And we are both part of Europe, in which we believe that whoever you are, regardless of your orientation, you can be there in public space. It does not include a gay-free zone.”The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, who secured a new term last weekend, vowed during his election campaign to “defend children from LGBT ideology”. The pledge proved popular among his conservative base and the Catholic church.In a survey conducted last year, when asked to name the biggest threat to Poland the most popular answer among men under 40 was “the LGBT movement and gender ideology”.Duda, who is allied with the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) , also vowed to oppose gay marriage or adoption by gay couples, which he described as part of “a foreign ideology”.The mayor of Nieuwegein, Frans Backhuijs, had expressed his concerns about developments in a letter to Puławy in March but did not receive a response.Bożena Krygier, the president of Puławy city council, told the Dutch broadcaster RTL Nederland: “Poland is Poland with its own identity, its own history and its own ideas. This is why we believe that partner municipalities should not interfere with our resolutions.”Relations between the two cities had already been in the deep freeze since 2015 after more than 21 years of official twinning.The motion backed by the councillors this week formally proposed to “unfriend” the two municipalities and terminate all contacts.“We therefore hope that the people concerned, who belong to the LGBTI community in Poland, feel supported by us,” Schouten said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165f7aa213b1edf42a42074b8b21cc573a5771fa/0_101_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=891b8e6dbaa052d7c7b0570260322b04","title":"north macedonia social democrats election victory","story":"Party now faces wrangle to form coalition government in run-up to EU accession talksNorth Macedonia’s Social Democrats eked out a razor-thin win over nationalist rivals, according to official election results, highlighting deep faultlines in a country preparing to start EU membership talks.The vote on Wednesday was the first parliamentary election since the Social Democrats added “North” to the Balkan country’s name last year – a move that ended a decades-old dispute with Greece but was highly controversial at home.The accord ushered the Balkan state into Nato and opened the door to future EU membership.But critics are still bitter about conceding part of their identity to appease Athens, which claimed exclusive rights to the name Macedonia for its own neighbouring region.This could postpone stable leadership at a time when coronavirus infections are surging and the country’s already weakened economy is heading towards a pandemic-triggered recession.That party is formally pro-EU but has been critical of the name deal, lambasting it as “treason”.“Our path to progress is confirmed,” the Social Democrat leader and former prime minister, Zoran Zaev, told supporters in a victory speech.“The citizens went out and voted for a clear future, for unity and solidarity, for economic patriotism, for law and order and to choose better present and a better future,” he said, adding that his camp had a three-seat advantage in the 120-member assembly.At the opposition headquarters, the VMRO-DPMNE secretary general, Igor Janusev, said the vote still showed “people want change”.Despite the first-place finish, the Social Democrats fared worse than in the previous poll in 2016, when they ended VMRO-DPMNE’s nearly decade-long rule.There was a perception that beyond the progress with the EU talks, the party had “not delivered on some of the key promises, including justice reforms”, said Elena Stavrevska, a political scientist at the London School of Economics.Low wages, high unemployment and widespread corruption have also been gnawing away at public faith in politics for years.“We have had enough of promises, now it is time for progress,” said 70-year-old Dimitar Sumkovski, a voter in the capital Skopje.The elections were held to replace a caretaker government that took over when Zaev stepped down six months ago after the EU’s initial failure to open accession talks – a promise Brussels had made in exchange for the name alteration and other changes.The bloc later gave the green light in March, although Skopje is still waiting for a date to start formal negotiations.Analysts predicted “difficult” coalition talks and a weak government. “We are going into a period of hard party negotiations and I think the government won’t be as stable as it was expected,” said Nikola Spasov, a political analyst.DUI, the traditional kingmaker, has this year demanded its candidate be named prime minister in exchange for any alliance.Zaev and the leader of VMRO-DPMNE, Hristijan Mickoski, have previously rejected the proposal as “blackmail”.With nearly 400 deaths from Covid-19, the land-locked country has the highest per capita fatality rate in the western Balkans, according to official data.Masks were mandatory at polling stations, which closed later than normal to allow for social distancing. Those infected with the virus were allowed to cast ballots earlier in the week, as were elderly and infirm people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f4da1d8eb690f21a5219ea0317ba8d28d7c9a82/0_0_3632_2476/master/3632.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac09c3b9098d6d2add985bad253b2dc 660w","title":"coronavirus live news fauci says us must stop nonsense south africa cases top 300000","story":"Israel reports new daily record of cases if Tokyo Games don’t go ahead, Beijing 2022 also likely to be cancelled Fauci says US could make end-of-year target Bolsonaro tests positive againAs the coronavirus pandemic advances across Mexico, Madeleine Wattenbarger has filed this piece from the town of Tepango de Rodríguez - which has so far managed to remain untouched.The town of about 4,000 people sits high in the mountains of the Sierra Norte in Puebla state, and was quick to apply strict preventive measures, closing its food market and installing health checkpoints.In May, Tepango de Rodríguez was included on a list of 324 towns that the Mexican government decided were eligible to reopen early, as part of a program called “Municipalities of Hope”.The plan allowed places with no Covid-19 cases – and with no cases in surrounding areas – to start lifting restrictions, in an attempt to mitigate the shutdown’s devastating economic impact.But less than two months later, Mexico has become one of the worst-affected countries in the world, with at least 311,000 cases and 36,000 deaths.

The University of Oxford, which has paired with drugmaker AstraZeneca to create another vaccine, said it was anticipating “positive news” on early trials of its drug.Danielle Renwick has interviewed experts Angela Rasmussen, virologist and associate research scientist, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and Anna Durbin, physician and professor, international health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Read their thoughts here:The number of confirmed cases has passed 35,000 in Afghanistan, while the number of deaths has surged. Poverty will mainly impact households whose work or activities are vulnerable to lockdowns, such as small retail and daily labor in construction, agriculture, or personal services, according to a report by the World Bank which was released Wednesday.The report finds that economic activity plummeted in the first half of 2020 as lockdowns and social distancing measures to curb Covid-19 negatively impacted the industry and service sectors. Despite continued robust growth in agriculture following the recovery from the 2018 drought, lower outputs in industry and services, as well as declining revenues due to trade disruptions and weaker tax compliance have put government finances under pressure. Henry Kerali, the World Bank’s country director for Afghanistan, said:The Covid-19 crisis is having a devastating impact on the livelihoods of Afghans while undermining the government’s revenue collection and its capacity to finance comprehensive programmes to save lives, protect the poor, and jumpstart the economy.Short-term measures are needed to support households through the current crisis, while improvements in the business regulatory environment and maintaining the core functions of government will pave the way for longer-term recovery. Ongoing support from development partners will help finance critical government operations and restore private sector confidence. The World Bank is working closely with the government of Afghanistan both to implement the short-term response and lay the foundations for longer-term recovery.The number of deaths from Covid-19 rose by 21 from the previous day to stand at 1,115 on Thursday. In its latest update, the health ministry said the number of people who had tested positive for the virus had reached 35,070, an increase of 76 on the day before. There have been 22,881 recoveries. Kabul reported 19 deaths today. The capital has been the country’s worst-affected area with 409 deaths.The western province of Herat, which borders Iran, reported 16 new infections on Thursday. Local officials there have warned of a second wave of the virus in the province. Officials said the flow of Afghan refugees from Iran and the failure to follow health guidelines have increased the possibility of a new wave of the virus. Fresh outbreaks have already started in some areas and the virus is threatening the lives of thousands of people, according to officials.In France, Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced that masks will be compulsory in all indoor public spaces from next week. Somewhat related, but mainly because I admire the stylish coordination, here are all the deputies from the Communist party wearing matching red face masks. Indonesia reported 1,574 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of infections to 81,668, its health ministry said.The country also reported 76 new coronavirus deaths, taking the overall death toll to 3,873, the ministry official Achmad Yurianto told a news briefing.The number of employees on company payrolls in Britain has fallen by almost 650,000 since the onset of the coronavirus crisis in March, official figures show.According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of hours worked in Britain plummeted between March and May at a record pace, as lockdown controls forced businesses across the country to temporarily close. It was the steepest fall since records began in 1971.Read the full report here:For everything you could possibly want to know about the status of the race to find a vaccine, I can highly recommend the New York Times’ Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. It’s a beautiful piece of digital design, as well as being incredibly informative. Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company Sinopharm has begun phase 3 clinical trials of a Covid-19 vaccine in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Abu Dhabi government media office said on Thursday.The human trial taking place in Abu Dhabi, part of the United Arab Emirates, is a partnership between Sinopharm’s China National Biotec Group (CNBG), Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing company Group 42 and the Abu Dhabi department of health.King Felipe VI of Spain has laid flowers at a state ceremony at the Royal Palace in Madrid to honour Spain’s 28,400 victims of the coronavirus crisis as well as those who have been fighting on the front line during the pandemic. If the postponed Tokyo Olympics do not go ahead next year due to Covid-19 then the 2022 Beijing Winter Games is also likely to be cancelled, according to long-time International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound. Reuters reports: The Beijing Winter Olympics are scheduled for Feb. 4 to 20, 2022, just six months after the Tokyo Summer Games, which are now set to be held from July 23 to Aug. 8, 2021 after being pushed back a year.Pound, a Canadian lawyer who has served as both an IOC vice-president and head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), also speculated on a range of scenarios, including one where a threat to the Beijing Games is not so much a U.S. boycott, but one where China might consider barring the U.S. from taking part if the country cannot gain control over the virus. He saidThat is an extreme supposition. There are all kinds of crazy things that could happen.

Kevin Stitt, the governor of Oklahoma in the US has become the first governor to test positive for coronavirus.Stitt, a Republican who has actively pushed to reopen his state and appeared to flout experts’ health recommendations, said on Wednesday that he had tested positive and felt “fine” apart from feeling a “little bit achy”. Stitt said he was “pretty shocked” to become the first governor to get the virus, adding that he would be quarantining away from his family and working from home. I want to use my story to remind Oklahomans that if you aren’t feeling well, we want you to get tested. That is it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today.

Between 2 and 8 July, 3,579 cases were transferred to the service out of 3,818 people who tested positive for coronavirus in England. I’m Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Lucy Campbell. I’ll be updating you on the key UK coronavirus developments throughout the day. The government is to finally publish the greatly anticipated Russia report before the summer parliamentary recess begins next week.A statement from the intelligence and security committee said:The intelligence and security committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the Report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess. There will be no further comment. The committee produced a report on alleged Russian interference in UK politics which was supposed to be published before last year’s general election. But the prime minister Boris Johnson withheld its release, promising it would be published “in due course”.There will be more on this as we get it.Michael Gove has confirmed that up to five sites in Kent will be used as Brexit border facilities as the government confirms purchase of the vast Kent site for customs clearance and a lorry park. Just days after the Cabinet Office minister said it was not the intent to use it as a lorry park, the Department for Transport has written to residents in Ashford to confirm the move, first revealed by the  on Friday. Local MP Damian Green, a former close ally of Theresa May, criticised the move on Monday as “wrong headed” attacking the lack of consultation on a scheme that would affect those who were buying new houses next to the site and the local hospital. The new chairman of parliament’s intelligence and security committee has condemned Downing Street’s attempt to impose its “preferred candidate” to lead the committee.Lewis said he did not respond to a call to vote for former cabinet minister Chris Grayling as he considered it to be an “improper request”.Lewis was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative party on Wednesday after securing the prestigious ISC chairmanship with the support of opposition members.In a statement, he said that the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the ISC chairman and gave it to the committee members.It was only yesterday afternoon that I received a text asking me to confirm that I would be voting for the prime minister’s preferred candidate for the ISC chair.I did not reply as I considered it an improper request. At no earlier stage did I give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate.The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, sidestepped questions about Lewis losing the Tory whip when asked about the issue in the Commons.Losing the whip used to be the result of serious misdemeanour, not independent thought. What does this say about the government’s approach to expertise and scrutiny?Gove, in his reply, said: The intelligence and security committee’s membership is chosen by this house, an election was appropriately taken place, but whipping matters are quite properly matters for the respective whips’ offices of our parties and not for those like myself who exercise a different constitutional role.Away from the economy, the Times (paywall) reports that hopes are up for a successful coronavirus vaccine after two leading groups got positive early results.The paper understands that a phase-one trial involving roughly 1,000 volunteers, a University of Oxford vaccine seems to have stimulated the desired response from the immune system, indicating encouraging levels of neutralising antibodies and the mobilisation of T-cells.The Lancet medical journal will publish early-stage human trial data from the Oxford team on Monday.The UK’s largest arts complex, the Southbank Centre, has confirmed 400 jobs are at risk as it enters into talks with staff in an attempt to reduce losses caused by the Covid-19 crisis.A spokesperson confirmed the news after workers were told about the cuts on Wednesday, which could lead to two-thirds of its staff being made redundant.It joins several other British arts institutions in confirming job losses, including the National Theatre, which announced it would shed 400 casual staff, including its entire front-of-house team.The recently announced £1.57bn arts recovery package has not stemmed the tide of redundancies affecting many venues.Almost a third of UK firms plan to lay off staff over the next three months in a further sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating impact on Britain’s job market, according to a report.The BCC said the survey was carried out prior to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announcing in the summer econmic update up to £30bn of fresh tax and spending measures last week to protect jobs and kickstart Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19.Despite those additional spending measures promised, the BCC said Sunak still needed to take further action to limit the damage for jobs, including a temporary cut in employer national insurance contributions and more funding for training staff.Get the full story here:If you’ve been made unemployed in the last three months, we would like to hear from you.

If we hadn’t done that the economy would have been in a far worse position.It is going to be very, very difficult for lots of people and we are going to do everything we can to support them and keep businesses going through this very difficult period.Around 500 jobs are being cut at luxury fashion firm Burberry in the UK and globally as it axes office space and makes cuts across stores outside Britain after lockdown sent sales tumbling.The firm said around 150 office jobs were expected to go in the UK, where it is headquartered, and a further 350 overseas as it looks to slash annual costs by a further £55m. This comes on top of the previously announced £140m cost savings.London was among the cities particularly badly impacted, as the firm makes much of its sales in the capital from tourist trade, which was been decimated by the grounding of planes during lockdowns.Marco Gobbetti, the chief executive of Burberry, said: Sales were severely impacted by the drop in luxury demand from Covid-19 and we expect it will take time to return to pre-crisis levels with the resumption of overseas travel.As we enter the second phase of our strategy, we are sharpening our focus on product and making other organisational changes to increase our agility and generate structural savings that we will be able to reinvest into consumer-facing activities to further strengthen our luxury positioning.In retail, tourist flows are likely to remain negligible, and store operations are continuing to face significant headwinds, with some remaining closed and operating with reduced trading hours.It said trading in the second half will “largely depend on the actions governments pursue to control the spread of the virus as economies restart”, including the potential for a second peak of the pandemic and additional lockdowns.Here is the ’s economics correspondent Richard Partington’s piece on the ONS figures.The figures reveal that the number of hours worked in the UK plummeted between March and May at a record pace, the steepest drop since records began in 1971.The England cricketer Jofra Archer has been dropped from playing the second test against the West Indies for breaking Covid-19 rules.

More on this story to follow:Continued lockdown in Leicester is no longer justified, the city’s mayor has said as the government prepares to decide whether to make changes to the restrictions.Sir Peter Soulsby claimed the government had got Leicester into a “messy situation” by its handling of the local lockdown.He said government data had “finally” told city officials which areas of Leicester were worst affected by coronavirus.If only we’d had this information in advance, we’d have been able to do what they’re now doing in Blackburn, which is actually working closely with the communities and avoiding having to be locked down.I very much regret the fact that the government didn’t trust us with this data earlier but I think now we’ve got it, we are the ones well-placed here in the city to make sure that we use it effectively.Speaking to Sky News, he criticised what he described as the government’s “blanket political-led lockdown” of the whole of the city, and said he was angry and frustrated.Some streets have no issue at all and in other streets nearby you’ve got a major issue, and we needed to know that at the time so we could intervene with pinpoint accuracy.Further advice needs to be given, support needs to be given, and we needed to know where that advice and support was needed.Asked when he expected to learn whether the local lockdown was being lifted, he added: The secretary of state is due to make an announcement this afternoon. I expect to hear when the rest of the city, and indeed the rest of the country hears - because frankly we have not been involved in any of the decision-making about this.We have been told what the political decisions will be, and we will be told again what the political decision will be - whether or not we come out of it.Asked what he hoped the health and social care secretary Matt Hancock would say, Soulsby went on: I hope he’ll recognise that as a result of what we are already doing here in the city, we are dramatically driving down the transmission of the virus.Asked what his reaction would be if the government announced a further two-week lockdown, the city’s mayor said: I think if we are told that, there are going to be an awful lot of Leicester people who are very angry indeed.It was quite clear that it was a political decision taken without the advice of Public Health England to take us into this lockdown in the first place.It’ll be a political decision to let us out and the sooner that political decision is taken, the better.The ONS figures show that vacancies fell 463,000 between March and May to a record low of 333,000 as companies froze hiring in the face of the coronavirus crisis.The pace of job cut announcements has also showed no sign of slowing down in recent weeks, with some 75,000 job losses announced last month alone, according to recent analysis by the PA Media news agency.This points to further grim jobless figures in the months to come.Jonathan Athow, the ONS’s deputy national statistician, said: Pay is now falling on most measures, with many furloughed workers not having their wages topped up by their employers.Matthew Percival, director for people and skills at the CBI business group, told PA: These figures show serious difficulties for hundreds of thousands of people, but unfortunately this is still only the beginning of the impact on the labour market.Flattening the unemployment curve will remain paramount.The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has said the latest unemployment figures from the ONS underlined the need for continuing government support to those sectors particularly hard hit by the coronavirus crisis.“Clearly there are some trends that can be discerned - the number of hours worked going down and the amount of economic inactivity going up as well,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.I think this is a very concerning time because we could see that being worsened by changes going ahead with the furlough scheme.We do think that for particularly badly affected sectors there does need to be continuing support, otherwise we will see extra waves of people potentially moving into unemployment or economic inactivity.As we’ve reported earlier, this suggests the number of UK workers on company payrolls has fallen during lockdown by nearly two-thirds of a million as the coronavirus crisis claimed another 74,000 jobs last month.The ONS said the pace of job losses appeared to have slowed in June, with claims under Universal Credit by the unemployed and those on low incomes falling by 28,100 between May and June to 2.6 million.With 9.4 million people on furlough classed as employed, the true impact is expected to only be shown after the current support scheme ends in October.The ONS figures suggest the increase in job losses were not as bad as many feared, partly due to large numbers of businesses placing employees on furlough. This suggests the full impact of the pandemic on jobs won’t be known until the furlough scheme ends in October.But the early estimates show 649,000 fewer people in employment in June compared with March.ONS analysis suggests around half a million employees who said they were temporarily away from their jobs due to the pandemic were receiving no pay.ONS analysis also found that pay is now growing at a slower rate than inflation, especially in sectors where furloughing is more prominent.Good morning! I’m Lucy Campbell, here to take you through the latest developments in UK politics and the coronavirus outbreak as the morning unfolds.The number of UK workers on payrolls fell by 649,000 between March and June as the coronavirus crisis claimed another 74,000 jobs last month, according to the Office for National Statistics.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: As the pandemic took hold, the labour market weakened markedly, but that rate of decline slowed into June, though this is before recent reports of job losses.There are now almost two-thirds of a million fewer employees on the payroll than before the lockdown, according to the latest tax data.The Labour Force Survey is showing only a small fall in employment, but shows a large number of people who report working no hours and getting no pay.There are now far more out-of-work people who are not looking for a job than before the pandemic.If you would like to get in touch to share a news tip or suggestion, please feel free to get in touch with me as I work."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The Government has delayed the next reopening phase from the Covid-19 lockdown, postponing the reopening of remaining pubs and resumption of larger gatherings of people amid concerns over rising coronavirus infections.Plans to allow pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs to recommence business from July 20th has been postponed until August 10th after the State’s health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections as restrictions have been relaxed.Proposals to permit larger gatherings of 100 people indoors, up from 50, and 500 people outdoors, up from 200, will also not proceed as earlier planned.Mr Donnelly also emphasised the need to get the R number down to below one. At present it is between 1.2 and 1.8, if that rate were to continue within three weeks the rate would be up to 150 cases per day, he warned. International evidenceMr Donnelly defended the Government’s decision, saying international evidence shows Covid-19 cases increase when pubs reopen. He said “nobody wants these restrictions in place”. He added that he hoped there would be no need for enforcement of wearing face covering in shops.The Minister said that the Government is taking Nphet advice to limit gatherings in homes to no more than 10 visitors. “It’s not 10 people, so if there’s five of you living in the house then you can be up to 15. Nphet have said for no more than four additional households which means essentially whoever lives in the house plus up to 10 people.”He said health are worried about clusters of cases.“What you can have is one person who is infected, but they are asymptomatic, they don’t know they are, they go to a house party, everyone’s talking loudly, there’s plenty of droplets going out into the air, you can end up with 20 to 30 people walking out of that house infected.”Mr Donnelly said the Government did not make the decision lightly. “But the public health advice is if we were to open now it could materially add to the possibility of a second wave and that’s just a risk we can take.”The lifting of the remaining restrictions would depend on the R rating he said. “It’s not one number, it’s not one fact, it’s in the round, where are we going, are we moving away from a second wave or are we moving towards a second wave.”Hospitality industryThe Government’s decision disappointed members of the hospitality industry.The president of the Irish Hotels Federation Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said “hitting the pause button” on the relaxation of Covid-19 regulations will put thousands of jobs at risk at a time when hotel room occupancy is only 30 per cent.The pause will also have an impact on people who had planned gatherings in hotels and wedding venues, she said.Around 18,000 couples this year will have their wedding day plans impacted by Covid-19 with many already changing their arrangements two to three times, she added.However, Infectious diseases consultant Corrina Sadlier has said the Government’s decision to pause the relaxing of the lockdown was the right thing to do.She said she understood this would cause extreme difficulties for the sectors affected, but “nothing about Covid-19 has been easy for anyone”.If the pause had not been implemented the country had been heading towards a second wave, she warned.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe delay in allowing pubs to reopen has been described as “devastating” by a third-generation Dublin publican who said everything was already in place for a planned reopening next Monday.The Swan, on the corner of Aungier Street and York Street in Dublin 2, is one of a handful of Victorian pubs left in the city. Its owner, Ronan Lynch, said the decision was “a disgrace”.He pointed out that he had a range of health-and-safety measures planned including social distancing and hand sanitisation stations and strict guidelines for staff to follow.He accused the Government of failing to even discuss any details of the measures already taken and those which were still required with the industry.“This is absolutely devastating,” he said. “We have been closed for 18 weeks and were the first and hardest hit sector . We all have financial commitments and things are just going to get harder and harder. It is so frustrating because we have not had any communication from Government as to what more we need to do.”He said the successful reopening at the end of June of pubs that serve food had given the sector great confidence that the remaining pubs would be facilitated from Monday, which made the news even harder to swallow.“There has been no dialogue from Government, it has been appalling, and we will end up being closed for 40 per cent of the year. We missed St Patrick’s Day, the end of the football and rugby season, all other sports and the tourist season, and on top of all that we have Brexit coming down the tracks.”He said what made it harder to understand was that publicans were already accustomed to managing customers better than most other sectors and knew how to control their space in a responsible fashion.‘Devastation’His views were echoed by others in the pub trade.“It is just devastation for us, the work we have put in to be ready for Monday for them to simply say we can’t reopen for another three weeks,” said Paul Moynihan of Moynihan’s Bar in Donard, Co Wicklow. “And it will be devastating for our customers too.”He pointed out that house parties and other social gatherings would continue where there would be few guidelines followed, “and yet we are the ones being kicked in the teeth”.“I can’t fathom it. Even on a personal level I was really looking forward to seeing our customers again, and we would have been well able to control it, but nobody appears to be listening to us.”Walsh’s pub in Stoneybatter has reconfigured its operation so it can reopen as planned on Monday.“The delay is simply not fair on so many pubs,” owner Anthony Malone said. “We were concerned this might happen and have been planning to offer food, and that is what we will do. Everything will be by the book and it will hopefully be another small step back to normal.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305303.1594832126!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public health ahead of commercial reality says hotelier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeitrim Sean Nós dancer-videographer Edwina Guckian and her son Páidí  with singer Eleanor Shanley  working on the   Enjoy Leitrim promotional video. Photograph: Brian FarrellA Co Leitrim hotelier has said while the consequences of the 14-day quarantine requirement for overseas visitors will be economically catastrophic, he does not want tourists who have not followed the rule staying at his hotel. Joe Dolan, a director of Fáilte Ireland and former president of the Irish Hotels Federation, said public health “has to take precedence over commercial reality” during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I would frown on overseas visitors who had not quarantined coming into my hotel,” he said. Mr Dolan, who owns the Bush Hotel in Carrick-on-Shannon, said he was “speaking with my heart and not my head” and understood the logic of the 14-day isolation requirement. “I wish it were not the case, but it is probably necessary. But the economic consequences for Ireland will be catastrophic because this will eliminate all short-stay visitors, including from the UK, our biggest market,” he said. He was speaking in advance of the launch of Enjoy Leitrim, a three-minute promotional video he has commissioned showcasing the benefits of visiting and living in the county. The video includes contributions from locally based writers and musicians including Michael Harding, Seamus O’Rourke, Eleanor Shanley and Charlie McGettigan, and will be launched on Thursday on the Leitrim Tourism social media channels. Edwina Guckian of Dreoilín Productions, who made the video during the lockdown, said the timing meant she was forced to focus on the county’s landscape rather than its people. “Myself and the four artists who were involved wanted to get the message across that we should appreciate what we have here, and this has been brought home to us during the pandemic,” she said. “We want people to know there is more out there than the Ring of Kerry and the Cliffs of Moher.” Mr Dolan said the current circumstances were making it extremely difficult for the tourism sector in Leitrim and around the country to operate, with many businesses expected to decide at the end of the summer whether to shut up shop for the winter. “For some it will be a case that they will lose less money by being closed than by staying open,” he said. Subsidy schemeHe added that while the Government’s Wage Subsidy Scheme had been crucial to the survival of many businesses including his own during the pandemic, other measures were needed such as waivers on rates and water charges. The owner of the 65-bedroom hotel, who laid off his staff at the start of the coronavirus lockdown, said he had 65 staff at the height of last year’s tourist season but only about half of that number had so far returned, though others were due back next week. “I would have to close my doors tomorrow without the Wage Subsidy Scheme,” said the hotelier, who believes he is luckier than many as almost 80 per cent of his business is domestic. He said the general consensus in the hotel sector was that while “you can’t get a cottage in the country for love nor money”, hotel room occupancy would be 25-33 per cent this year with consumer confidence a big factor. Mr Dolan also said a Government announcement about a package for the hospitality sector was expected and he believed a lot of businesses would need a non-repayable grant scheme to bridge the difference “between what we need to borrow and want we can afford to repay”. A cut in the VAT rate for the sector would be a key factor in stimulating bookings and sales, he added. “The last cut in VAT was very effective , the most innovative job creation strategy after the financial crisis,” he said.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe dismissal of Barry Cowen as Minister for Agriculture by Taoiseach Micheál Martin has the potential to cause a serious rift in the parliamentary party, its TDs have said.In the Dáil on Wednesday Mr Martin strongly stood over his decision to sack Mr Cowen on Tuesday night after the latter refused to make a further statement on the drink-driving ban he received in 2016.But in a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the Taoiseach and his decision to sack him, Mr Cowen told Fianna Fáil activists in his constituency that the party was “definitely bigger” than Mr Martin.“FF is bigger than me. It’s definitely bigger than M Martin. I have apologised for my actions. I made a stupid mistake but I did not do what they have accused me of,” he texted.The Taoiseach also told the Dáil he had “never sought in any shape or form to undermine . . . the accuracy or credibility of any Garda statement on the file”.That put his position on the Garda Pulse report of the incident directly at odds with that of Mr Cowen. The Offaly TD has strongly refuted a statement in the report that he tried to evade a Garda checkpoint.The  understands the Garda Pulse record is brief and says Mr Cowen turned his car off the road ahead of gardaí up ahead.It suggests that when the gardaí went to check where his car had gone, they engaged him in conversation and detected the drink-driving offence.No vettingGardaí have also said they process requests for access to personal data without preferential treatment and do not carry out ministerial vetting.Fianna Fáil TDs contacted yesterday said as many as a third of the party’s members would be sceptical of, or openly opposed to, Mr Martin’s leadership. One said a substantial minority believed the coalition with Fine Gael could lead to the ruination of the party.Another TD said: “Those outside the fold believe Micheál is a spent docket. The only question is: will there be a challenge to him sooner rather than later?”In a move widely expected, deputy leader Dara Calleary was appointed new Minister for Agriculture. Dublin West TD Jack Chambers has been named as Mr Calleary’s successor as chief whip with responsibility for the Gaeltacht. In a tweet he promised to work hard to improve his Irish. The Laois TD Sean Fleming has been appointed Minister of State for Finance."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305525.1594876722!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin has a number of very significant enemies in fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClockwise, from top left: Hugh Linehan, Jennifer Bray, Pat Leahy and Harry McGeeIt was sad for Inside Politics host Hugh Linehan that his event “New Taoiseach, New Government, New Challenges” – part of the  Summer Nights Festival – fell on such a slow news day. And so, with nothing else to talk about, he, Jennifer Bray, Pat Leahy and Harry McGee had to talk about the overnight sacking of Barry Cowen, the record-winningly short-tenured agriculture minister, for a drink driving conviction several years ago. The festival – supported by Peugeot – is a series of online talks taking place from Monday July 13th to Thursday 16th“It’s been a placid start for the new government, I don’t think,” said Leahy. Leahy put it in a broader context: “I think what we’ve seen over recent weeks is the effect of being so long in opposition for Fianna Fáil. That ruthless self-discipline… I think at least some of that has left the party, and we now have a situation where Micheál Martin has a number of very significant enemies in the party.”Bray discussed the grudges and disaffection within Fianna Fáil and said Martin was unlikely to lead them into the next election. Fianna Fáil had a particular challenge, said Bray, “They have a lot to prove… They have to prove they’re fiscally prudent, responsible and capable of rebooting the economy… It’s their opportunity to waste.”  McGee reported on the dissatisfaction at the grass roots of the Green Party and the “good mannered” leadership battle between Catherine Martin and Eamon Ryan. Bray discussed the manner in which Fine Gael went from being “defeated” to being reinvigorated by their response to the pandemic, just as Martin was taking on leadership of the country. A viewer asked whether Varadkar would leave the leadership of Fine Gael as he has suggested. McGee noted that though the Fine Gael leader had mentioned he would like to retire from politics by the age of 50, “I don’t think Leo Varadkar is in any hurry to go anywhere.” They briefly discussed Sinn Féin and their chances of coming into power with the next election. Leahy ended the discussion by suggesting that Sinn Féin would have to unite the parties of the left and offer an “alternative sort of government”. Thursday, the final night of the festival, will include: former US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power lawyer and former White House insider Melody Barnes (both interviewed by Fintan O’Toole) and musician Imelda May (in conversation with Róisín Ingle).Ticket buyers receive a link by email on each day of the festival, allowing them to attend the events via their phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305539.1594848401!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord things just keep getting better for the new taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe There is an apocryphal rule often attributed to Tony Blair’s former spokesman Alastair Campbell that if a politician continues to be mired in controversy a fortnight after the story first breaks then he or she will have to walk the plank.The saga that concluded with the demise of Barry Cowen’s short-lived ministerial career did not last quite so long - 12 days. However, it did follow an arc very similar to that of previous minsters who were sacked, or forced to resign, such as Alan Shatter and Frances Fitzgerald.Friday, July 3rd:Rumours have been circulating for some days about a drinking ban that Cowen had in the past. Both Cowen’s office and that of Taoiseach Micheál Martin are contacted by the Irish Independent with records purporting to show that Cowen was given a three-month ban for drink-driving in 2016 and also received a €200 fine. It is the first that Martin has known of the offence.Saturday, July 4th:The report is published. It also emerges that Cowen (49) was driving on a provisional licence and had been for some years. He issues a statement saying he is “profoundly sorry”. He also lets it be known he now has a full driving licence but does not disclose when he made the test.Sunday, July 5th:The situation has now become a crisis for Fianna Fáil. The party has earlier had to contend with internal ructions over ministerial appointments. Cowen, in the first of a series of apologies, is a guest on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics.He makes a candid apology. “The fact of the matter was it was a terribly stupid, stupid, mistake on my part,” he says. “It is something that I am very regretful for.”He admits that he had driven unaccompanied on occasions when on a learner permit and says, in hindsight, maybe he should have informed Micheál Martin at the time.Paul Murphy, the Rise TD, says it is “bizarre” that anybody who is close to 50 did not have a full licence.Further stories emerge about a speeding ticket and another minor road traffic infractions, seemingly gleaned from a Garda Pulse report.Monday, July 6th:Amid persistent demands from the Opposition for more clarity, it emerges that Cowen has contacted the Ceann Comhairle asking to make a personal statement on the matter in the Dáil. It is agreed he will speak the following day.Micheál Martin seems reassured by Cowen’s apology and explanation for not contacting him earlier. “He was deeply ashamed of it and embarrassed that the incident occurred in 2016,” he says.Tuesday July 7th:Cowen makes a personal statement in the Dáil at 9pm. He again apologises about his “stupid mistake”.He explains for the first time the details of his drink-driving arrest. It happened on the day of the All Ireland football final. He was stopped in Co Kildare as he was returning to Co Offaly with a friend.“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly. On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a Breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit.”While he was on a provisional licence at the time, he says “I subsequently secured and now hold a full clean driving licence.“Before reform it was not uncommon for people of all ages and experience to be on a provisional licence.”He also says he has spoken to a number of road safety campaigners earlier that day including Susan Gray of Parc. He says he had apologised to them.But Gray later criticises Cowen, saying he failed to address various aspects of his driving licence. She and others call for him to specify how many learner permits he held, and if he displayed “L” or “N” plates on his car.Sunday, July 12th:The controversy seems to have receded a bit. However, The Sunday Times now reports details of the Garda record of the September 2016 incident which alleges the Offaly TD was pursed by gardaí after doing a U-turn before a Garda checkpoint.Cowen begins a robust defence. He claims the Garda record is “incorrect” and says the fact that gardaí leaked a Pulse record was an act of criminality.He states that he had never evaded or avoided a Garda checkpoint. “I did not evade or attempt to evade a garda. Such an act would constitute a serious criminal offence,” he says.It was, arguably, a more serious offence than the drink-driving ban. Under Section 109 of the Road Traffic Act failure to stop a vehicle when required by a Garda is a criminal offence, punishable by fine, andor imprisonment.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) is asked by the Garda to investigate the circumstances in which the confidential Garda Pulse record of the incident was leaked to the media.Other details are now emerging. It is clear that copies of the Garda Pulse record had been leaked to reporters at least ten days before then. And the record contained the allegation that Cowen had tried to avoid the checkpoint.This allegation of evasion had been put to Cowen and to Fianna Fáil as early as July 3rd, nine days beforehand. However, Cowen had denied it very strenuously. It had not appeared in earlier media reports and Cowen himself had made no reference to it.The previous week Martin had briefed Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Green leader Eamon Ryan on the incident but had made no mention of the alleged evasion of the checkpoint. Varadkar had said he did not want any more surprises.Monday, July 13th:Perhaps the day that sealed Barry Cowen’s fate. Asked for comment by RTÉ’s Midlands Correspondent Ciarán Mulooly, Cowen says that under legal advice he was not making any further comment until such time as Gsoc issued its report.Varadkar is interviewed on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. He refers to his comments from the previous week where he wanted no more surprises and then refers to the new revelations. However, the thrust of his interview is calibrated. He does not call for a head and seems to accept that perhaps allowing the Gsoc investigation to follow its course might be the preferable option.Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin, speaking on Newstalk, says Cowen needs to clarify matters further.That is the theme being pursued by the Opposition parties who are asking Cowen to make a new statement and also to answer questions in the Dáil. Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly says the fact there was a dispute between his account and that of the Garda record showed the need for him to answer questions in the Dáil.\u0026nbsp“He has said he wants to draw a line under it, the Taoiseach says he wants to draw a line under it. Clearly a line has not been drawn under it. We are still talking about it now ten days after it was first revealed.”The previous week, Cowen had requested and received the Pulse report of the incident from the Garda. He and Martin have a lengthy conversation on Monday night about the record. Martin asks to see it.As questions are raised about the source of the leaks, the Meath East TD Thomas Byrne rejects suggestions that he had tipped off the media about Cowen’s run-in with the Garda.“There’s a civil matter in relation to this. It does not involve me. I’m on good terms with Barry Cowen,” he tells LMFM in an interview.Tuesday July 14th:Micheál Martin and Cowen meet to further discuss the matter. Cowen shows Martin the Pulse report, which suggests a more benign interpretation of events than had been portrayed by the media.Martin lets Cowen know that in his view a “comprehensive statement was required” and that he as Minister and an office holder was obliged to come before the House to explain himself.“In my view, the issue could only be resolved with the political route.”Martin tells Cowen it does not have to be on Tuesday, or even Wednesday but at some stage a comprehensive statement is required.At around 11.30am, Martin meets Varadkar and Ryan and tells them that Cowen has said he will make no further statement and he has had asked him to reflect on his position. Both said they agreed with his position and would support what decision he would make.Sources in both parties insist that neither forced the issue in any way or “sought a head on a plate”.“I thought when the Taoiseach went in at 2pm he was actually going to announce that Cowen was gone,” said one.In the event, Martin gave a partial defence of Cowen under questioning in the Dáil from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. Again he referred to some ambiguity in the Pulse record.“I saw the document myself this morning and having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed. \u0026nbspNonetheless, the document is there.”In those sentences, he was outlining the problem (the Pulse document existed and needed to be explained) and the possible solution for Cowen (a more benign reading of it).But it needed Cowen to agree to make a fresh statement before the Dáil and answer questions.Shortly after Leaders’ Questions Martin went to the canteen in Leinster House and spoke casually to journalists. He pointed out that the statement made no explicit reference to a “U-turn”. It seemed to suggest that he was still holding out hope Cowen would change his mind.The relatively spirited defence of Cowen, plus the refusal to allow a statement, suggested that the Government was holding a line and was now prepared to weather out the controversy. Those with experience of previous occasions when office holders were sacked or resigned were familiar with the temporal arc. The controversy would reach a point where the pressure was so unbearable and the clamour so frenzied that the Minister was holding on by a thread. One more sliver of trouble would be enough to topple him or her.As one former Fine Gael minister said on Tuesday: “It had not reached that point. It was much too early. Nobody had any expectation that he was about to get sacked.”And that’s why it took so many by surprise. Just before 9pm, Martin went to the Dáil to announce he had sacked Cowen over his refusal to make a further statement. He said there were questions that needed clarification and it was not tenable for other Ministers to provide a proxy for Cowen by trying to answer them.So what happened in the intervening seven hours? Well, it seemed that well before 2pm, Martin had already made up his mind that Cowen had to go if he refused to make a second statement.His defence of him in the Dáil was affording the Offaly TD a final chance to address the issues. Later that afternoon he formally asked Cowen to reconsider. Cowen refused. He then asked him to resign. He refused. The plank was now readied.Within half an hour of the bombshell, Cowen responded with a lengthy statement on Twitter, with a direct cut at Martin for sacking him only seven hours after backing him.“Ten days ago and this afternoon the Taoiseach believed my failure of 2016 didn’t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse report I gave him this morning.“Unfortunately the decision of the Taoiseach to remove me from office, when he supported me this afternoon in the Dáil, has undermined and potentially prejudiced my entitlement to fair process,” he said.Publicly, Fianna Fáil TDs strongly backed the Taoiseach’s decision, praising him for being decisive. They also expressed personal sympathy for Cowen, who is popular and respected by his colleagues.Wednesday July 15th:Martin’s disposition was matter-of-fact and unruffled during Leaders Questions in the Dáil’s temporary home of the National Convention Centre. He refuted Mary Lou McDonald’s claim that he (Martin) challenged the Garda report, arguing that he had never done that, and that was why he expected Cowen to make a clarification.Cowen arrives at the centre and goes into the chamber. He is seen talking to John McGuinness and, later, to Eamon O Cuív. They may be chance encounters but they underline the potential split within the party. Backbench TDs in the canteen are bemused - they refer to it as the worst possible start in Government.Nobody quibbles when Dara Calleary is announced as the new Minister.Martin continues to face questions about the matter from Opposition TDs. However, as the day continues, it is the Apple judgement that begins to dominate the agenda. A potential crisis has been allayed for now."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Cases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302587.1594542601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government announces 700m for britain eu border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Photograph: Nicolas AsfouriAFP via Getty ImagesFerocious partisanship has its uses. If nothing else, a ided nation can console itself that no government idea goes unexamined and unopposed. Scrutiny can be all the more exacting for being born of tribal malice rather than Socratic truth-seeking. The US is riven – it has managed to politicise the workaday face-mask – but it avoids the equal and opposite danger of unreflective consensus.Except, that is, on the most momentous policy of the century. To be in Washington is to sense a nation sliding into open-ended conflict against China with eerily little debate. Politicians who can be counted on to dispute the colour of the sky or the sum of two plus two are of a piece on the necessity of a superpower duel. In the Rambo trailers that pass for his campaign ads, Joe Biden faults President Donald Trump’s China line only for its softness.Nor is the Democratic candidate for the White House a rare belligerent in his party. Chuck Schumer, who leads it in the Senate, has urged the president to “hang tough” on tariffs for “strength is the only way to win with China”. He was not pressed to say what in the historic record justifies this coffee-mug banality, or against which nation he would ever counsel weakness. No, that would require debate. Neither in Washington nor in the corporate sector is there much to be found, at least on the record. Academics have been more forthcoming with their qualms, but not in great number or to great effect.The result is that un-American thing, consensus, and it concerns not just the future but increasingly the past. Everyone now “knows” that pre-Trump Washington was a place of Whiggish credulity, forever betting on material enrichment to make of China a vast Japan or South Korea: a democracy, a friend. In this account, its admittance to the World Trade Organisation was the inadvertent crowning of a rival by American enablers.Leave aside the slander against presidents from George HW Bush (who defied Beijing to arm Taiwan) to Barack Obama (who put tariffs on Chinese tyres). Leave aside the idea that America’s only options are liberal naïvéte and a second cold war. As in the 1940s, when the US was said to have “lost” China to communism, the premise here is that Earth’s most populous country, and oldest living civilisation, rises and falls in response to US policy. That it has agency of its own, that its post-1978 reforms were going to restore its stature anyway is, in Washington, a more exotic suggestion than it should be.Minority reportsNone of this is a plea for (how easily the Soviet-era patter returns) detente. It might be that a US-China struggle is not just defensible, but ordained. We know the international-relations theory by now. A surging power, an established one a one-party state, a democracy: the raw materials for conflict are there. But it is possible to believe all this and still feel unnerved by the lack of public deliberation and prominent dissenters. Even at the dawn of the cold war, there was Senator Robert Taft to argue against Nato. There was diplomat George Kennan, the 20th century’s most unwittingly important man, who viewed “containment” as a bellicose misreading of his advice. And these minority reports were filed in a much more deferential America than today’s.The absence of such voices now is disconcerting. For it means that policy is not being refined and stress-tested through argument. It is no longer clear, for instance, if US grievances stop at China’s trade practices or reach into its domestic treatment of its own people. Mikes Pence and Pompeo, the vice-president and secretary of state, flag the second more often than Trump does. Democrats mention it more than Republicans. This mission creep, if it is afoot, rather matters. An economic rivalry would be fraught enough. One that pits governing philosophies against each other is much harder to finesse.Another implication of the consensus is that dissent is becoming a political no-no. There is a dark past to contend with here. It is forgotten that McCarthyism’s breakthrough had little to do with Russia. It was that alleged loss of China. American diplomats were hounded by their own lawmakers (the right mastered cancel culture first). When President Harry Truman cashiered general Douglas MacArthur, who itched to strike China, not everyone sided with civilian over military power.Washington now is nowhere near that level of frenzy. Even by the standards of an election year, though, the reluctance to say anything construable as “soft” is impossible to miss. America’s ultimate advantage is the raucousness of its public discourse. On the China question, it is troublingly civilised. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"colstons real replacement must rebuke cancel culture","story":"Overnight, Black Lives Matter elves erected a statue on the plinth vacated by Edward Colston when his likeness took an early bath in Bristol Harbour last month. The new incumbent, entitled “A Surge of Power”, depicts BLM protester Jen Reid engaged in a black power salute. “It’s something the people of Bristol appreciate seeing,” Reid declared of the depiction of herself, hours after the substitution. Even we anti-iconoclasts must admire the chutzpah.Yet the statue is a serious piece of work, created by Marc Quinn, who sculpted Alison Lapper Pregnant which occupied Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth in the noughties. Aesthetically, it’s a winner, in my (layman’s) opinion. But it cannot stay where it is. This would demonstrate the authorities’ craven abdication of decision-making to unelected activists. Its erection, without a shred of debate, is consistent with BLM’s Marxist roots.Bristol city councillors insist that residents should decide on Colston’s replacement. My first choice would be to restore the slaverphilanthropist to his plinth, ideally in a ceremonial procession flanked by local dignitaries, purely to send out a robust condemnation of vandalism. Among less isive Bristolian candidates gorgeous Cary Grant or the recently-cancelled John Cleese, preferably in full Fawlty Towers goose-step mode. But a public consultation could also yield a joke winner, designed to wind up the judges (“Plinthy McPlinthface”?)As an offspring of a Bristolian father, and therefore deserving of at least half a vote (identity politics is everywhere now), I have a modest proposal. A statue in homage to the city’s most famous living daughter, JK Rowling, ideally a substantial artefact with artistic heft, not a piece of Harry Potter kitsch involving centaurs and wands. It should reflect her status as creator of a significant cultural export, a canon which inspired millions of otherwise book-phobic youngsters to become enthusiastic readers and sparked a renaissance in British filmmaking.The statue would also provide the perfect rebuke to a loathsome contemporary trend. For readers fortunate enough to have missed the latest broadsides in this internecine war, Rowling, despite her decades of support for progressive causes, has been summarily “cancelled” by the Left and denounced as a bigot for refusing to bend to trans orthodoxy over biological sex. As one of a vanishingly rare breed prepared to speak out, celebrating her would sound a powerful rallying cry for free expression and intellectual courage.The city urgently needs this wake-up call. Bristol University recently abandoned young academic Raquel Rosario Sanchez to a vicious two-year bullying campaign. Since chairing an event for the organisation Woman’s Place on proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act, Sanchez has been hounded by trans activists, even forced to hire her own private security guards to guarantee her safety on campus. Shamefully, this lofty Russell Group institution failed to protect her or discipline those responsible.Honouring Rowling would underscore three unfashionable truths that biological sex is no mere social construct, that mob tactics are entirely unacceptable and that free speech should remain an inalienable right on campus – and everywhere else.

He would then stay somewhere else. This happened on so many occasions that it is not possible for me to remember them all in detail. However, I would describe it as a recurring cycle that Ms Heard would abuse Mr Depp, who would then remove himself from the situation.Mr Depp, 57, is suing the tabloid\u0027s publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards Ms Heard, 34, throughout their relationship.Mr Depp denies ever hitting Ms Heard or being abusive towards her.Appearing in support of the actor Mr Bett, a former officer at Los Angeles County Sheriff\u0027s Department, said problems would frequently arise from Ms Heard\u0027s habit of drinking large quantities of red wine.He said: Ms Heard often behaved in this way when she had been drinking. I learnt quickly to recognize the signs, so that we were able to leave the situation before it escalated further. I also knew that she could be violent towards Mr Depp, so it was important that he did not remain in a situation with Ms Heard when she was in this kind of abusive mood.Mr Bett, who admitted in court that he found Ms Heard to be perfectly polite when he was on his own with her without Mr Depp, said he had never seen the actor physically abusing his wife or anyone else.He said: “I have never seen Mr Depp being violent to anyone including Ms Heard during the long period I have been working for him. In addition, I have observed Ms Heard throwing bottles, glasses and other objects at Mr Depp while being verbally abusive towards him. As a rule, during these episodes Mr Depp remains fairly passive and either tries to calm Ms Heard down or remove himself from the situation.The actor\u0027s legal team decided on Thursday they would not need to call actresses Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis.Mr Depp’s former partners were due to give evidence over a video link but his barrister David Sherborne said there was no need to call them since the defendants’ case is that the actor was violent to Ms Heard and not other women.He told the court: There is no need to reschedule those witnesses, much as it would have been a pleasure to have them here.The Pirates Of The Caribbean star is suing NGN and Mr Wootton over the publication of an article on April 27 2018 with the headline: Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?.His lawyers say the article bore the meaning there was overwhelming evidence Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on a number of occasions and left her in fear for her life.Ms Heard claims that during one incident in Australia she was subjected to a three-day hostage situation during which Mr Depp drank to excess and took pills.NGN is defending the article as true, and says Mr Depp was controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Ms Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 16th july 2020","story":"Indonesian Clowns use face shields while entertaining children in refugee camps, in Jakarta, IndonesiaPolitics latest news: Delayed Russia report to be published next week by Intelligence and Security CommitteeTravel latest: Nicola Sturgeon \u0026#39will not shy away\u0026#39 from quarantine for English visitorsJulian Lewis hits back at Boris Johnson after he is stripped of Conservative whipCoronavirus latest news: Leicester mayor criticises \u0026#39blanket political-led lockdown\u0026#39 ahead of review Comment: If we cannot scrape the mould off Boris\u0026#39 \u0026#39oven-ready\u0026#39 Brexit deal, let\u0026#39s throw it in the binProject fear is the government\u0026#39s \u0026#39one truly effective policy\u0026#39Covid hospital robots \u0026#39could be hacked for cyber-terrorism\u0026#39Amber Heard was regularly violent to Johnny Depp, says his head of securityRoyal Navy submarine and Stena ferry \u0026#39came within 100m of colliding\u0026#39Shamima Begum wins right to return to UK to challenge stripping of citizenshipDonald Trump rebukes senior adviser for attacking popular Anthony FauciWho will be Joe Biden\u0026#39s running mate?Risk of local lockdowns - are Covid-19 cases in your area rising or falling?Police and CPS to end \u0026#39digital strip searches\u0026#39 of sexual assault victims following legal threatThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayWatch: Ruptured crude oil pipeline sets off a huge fire in EgyptPriti Patel accused of \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39 by French MP over claims France is failing to turn back Channel migrantsThe UK art galleries reopening in July \u0026amp August – and the best exhibitions to seeBlack Lives Matter statue of Jen Reid removed from Colston plinthBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine stena ferry came within 100m colliding","story":"The third near miss in four years between a Royal Navy submarine and a civilian vessel has sparked “significant concern” from investigators.A report into the incident between a submerged submarine and a Stena ferry, says that without the “great presence of mind” of a crew member on the civilian craft, there was a significant chance of a collision.The near miss, on November 6, 2018, occurred in the busy waterway between Belfast and Cairnryan.The Officer of the Watch on the Stena Superfast VII was forced to take action to avoid collision with the submerged submarine that had been spotted at close range ahead of the ferry.As the ferry turned hard to port the submarine maintained its course and passed across the Stena Superfast VII’s bows. It was photographed close to the starboard side of the ferry.The report says the two vessels could have been within 100m of each other as the ferry, which had 282 passengers and crew on board, took the avoiding action.Although aware of the ferry, the submarine’s control room team had overestimated the civilian craft’s range and underestimated its speed. The report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said the submarine’s commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that\u2028”might have appeared rational to them at the time” but were actually based on inaccurate information. The report cited two previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels in recent years. In all three incidents key decisions on board the submarines were made based on “an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity” the report said. The Stena Superfast VII ferry was just over 200m long and weighed 30,285 tons. Given a closing speed of around 27 knots between the two vessels there was every chance that the ferry would have suffered significant underwater damage had a collision occurred.It is not known if the Royal Navy vessel was an Astute or Trafalgar Class hunter killer boat, or one of the four Vanguard Class nuclear-armed deterrent submarines. There were no nuclear safety issues during the near miss.The report said there is no expectation that the bridge team of a merchant ship should be able to detect or avoid a submerged submarine. The investigation board said it was “extremely fortunate” that Stena Superfast VII’s lookout spotted the submarine’s periscope.The  understands the Royal Navy has accepted in full the recommendations of the report. A thorough safety investigation in 2018 identified the necessary actions to prevent a re-occurrence and these have now been enacted by the Navy and explained to the MAIB. Administrative action was taken against at least one member of the submarine’s crew rather than disciplinary proceedings. The MoD said it would be “inappropriate to comment any further on inidual cases”.The incident is the third in four years involving Royal Navy submarines and civilian vessels.On 15 April 15, 2015, a submarine was deep in the Irish Sea when it snagged the fishing vessel Karen’s trawl wires. Karen was dragged backwards at about seven knots and partially submerged before the trawl wires snapped.On 20 July 20, 2016 the Royal Navy attack submarine, HMS Ambush, collided with the merchant vessel Andreas near Gibraltar.HMS Ambush was at periscope depth and conducting tactical training exercises at the time. A subsequent investigation found the crew were not maintaining a continuous all-round look to reduce the risk of detection in a simulated threat environment. The report stated the key common factor between the latest incident and two previous collisions involving submerged Royal Navy submarines was the absence of a sufficiently accurate plot of surface shipping, a critical factor to ensure sound decision-making.A Royal Navy Spokesperson said: “Ensuring safety at sea is a top priority for the Royal Navy, which is why we welcome this report and have already taken action to tighten our training and procedures.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/13/17/clive-tyldesley.jpg","title":"clive tyldesley itv commentary twitter response sam matterface","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Long-serving broadcaster says he has not done anything to warrant a sacking or demotion nor has any health concerns after being replaced by Sam Matterface as ITV\u0027s lead football commentatorThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Labour has accused the government of handing out lucrative Covid-19 contracts to Conservative friends and warned that equipment has not been delivered.Ministers were urged to explain how deals worth “more than £830m have been awarded to at least 12 different companies” for personal protective equipment (PPE) – which has “never materialised”.In the Commons, Labour also demanded answers over a contract handed – “without any public tender process” – to Public First, a company run by a former aide to Michael Gove and associate of Dominic Cummings.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt was “owned by friends of the prime minister’s most senior adviser”, Helen Hayes, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said – and “justified as part of the coronavirus response but appears to relate to Brexit”.“The flexibility required by extraordinary circumstances is no excuse for reducing transparency or abandoning any attempt at due diligence,” Ms Hayes protested.PM\u0027s \u0027incompetence\u0027 to blame for intelligence committee humiliationPenny Mordaunt, a Cabinet Office minister, did not deny that PPE had not been delivered, but insisted every MP knew a senior employee at Public First – who was a “former much-loved deputy speaker” of the Commons.“If the honourable lady has serious concerns about these contracts, other than insinuations, there are very clear process to go through, and I would urge her to do so,” she said.The row comes as the government faces a court case over the awarding of emergency contracts, outside of normal rules, alleging breaches of procurement law and apparent bias to longstanding associates.It has been launched by the Good Law Project, which instigated important legal, and is crowdfunding for resources.Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeControversy surrounds a £32m contract handed to a pest control company called PestFix to source surgical gowns, although it has listed net assets of only £18,000.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved. So what about it HAVING failed to conquer Hollywood or overthrow international capitalism Russell Brand took on a slightly more manageable project, last week.A cameo in Neighbours where he literally bumped into Toadie, eating a muffin, at the Harold Bishop cafe.“You’re Russell Brand! What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The restrictions include a limit of two people from the same household allowed to visit another home.And as part of the new rules, residents are being told to wear cloth face coverings in all enclosed public spaces, including workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres and hair and beauty salons.

The official advice remains that employees should work from home when they can - although the PM has said in recent days that they should consider coming back into the office. He told ministers this week that tens of thousands of Whitehall civil servants could set an example by ing to work. Ministers are hoping to entice people back by encouraging people to believe that public transport is safe to use. August has been earmarked for the introduction of the new nuanced system for travel networks as it is usually the quietest period, when people are often taking time off anyway. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. It wonapost be a green light for bosses to force all staff back into work, however. Peak rush hour usage between am and am is still to be advised against, which will remain for essential travel. Instead, Brits will be encouraged to drive, walk and cycle, and only use buses and trains between am and pm, and after pm. The new roadmap would show how staff canto work over the next nine months - including details on using public transport safely.  But the chief of the FDA union Dave Penman said: Civil servants are there to provide vital public services, not simply supply customers to city-centre economies at a risk to their personal health.It comes as the UKaposs coronavirus death toll reached , on Wednesday - an increase of  on the day before. Greece has, meanwhile, reopened to direct flights from the UK and Rishi Sunak has admitted tax rises could be on the way to rescue the economy.

Errol Grahamaposs daughter-in-law has been granted a two-day judicial review hearing to argue the governmentaposs protection for vulnerable benefit claimants was unlawful. In an important test case, Alison Turner will also ask judges to declare the Work and Pensions Secretary, Therese Coffey, breached the law by failing to properly review its policies after Errolaposs death. If she wins the judicial review, it could have profound implications for the future of Department for Work and Pensions benefit policy for the most vulnerable. A DWP spokesman said: “It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.” Errol Graham weighed less than five stone when bailfs found his body in June  - eight months after his ESA disabled benefit was stopped for missing an appointment. The -year-old, who had severe mental health dficulties, had just a couple of five-year-old tins of fish in his cupboard. Mr Grahamaposs death was referred to a Serious Case Panel. But its membership is secret and the DWP has refused to sayMs Turner will be allowed to see the findings. Ms Turner said in a statement: “Errol had a long history of serious mental illness which left him severely incapacitated. When the circumstances of his death came to light we had hoped and from what the DWP stated at the inquest, we had expected that the department would review their safeguarding policies and involve us in that review. “But, incredibly, that has not happened.We deserve answers and those answers need to be public for the sake of other families - and other vulnerable benefits claimants who suffer similar mental health dficulties. “No one  should be put at risk in the same way Errol was because adequate safeguarding measures are not in place.” Mr Grahamaposs death sparked fresh calls for an independent inquiry into benefit claimantsapos deaths. The spiral towards losing his benefits began on  August , when he failed to attend a fit-for-work test for his ESA.

We should also move as quickly as possible. The PM said that the case for both Houses staying in place should be considered but that other locations should be in the mix. He stated: However, the review should also consider a possible location outside London. The Government is considering establishing a Government hub in York and it would therefore make sense to consider this as a potential location. The comments came after a new consultation process was launched last month which considered whether MPs and peers would need to vacate the historic building as work is carried out. In the letter to people involved in the review, the PM said: We should also move as quickly as possible, both because of the risks associated with the current state of the building and the need to provide certainty on the way forward and thereby minimise disruption to our business. Before Parliament voted in  to approve the renewal works, which will entail decanting the whole building for at least six years, MPs had pushed rival plans that would have seen only a partial vacating required. This would have forced builders to work around the Commons schedule.The idea has since gained traction again following the coronavirus outbreak.A recent report by the National Audit Officestated that the £ billion cost previously reported for the project was likely to be a median figure, with the final outlay on the Unesco World Heritage Site expected to be higher. Initial estimates put the final bill as high as £ billion, with the builders expected to be in until the s. The body said that a team will assess whether a recommendation made in a report four years ago that all MPs and Lords should leave the Palace of Westminster while the work was carried out is still the best and most cost-effective option.

The potentially massive maritime disaster came after the crew of the partially submerged sub had underestimated the ferry’s speed and distance. But the Stena Line ship’s quick-thinking officer took “immediate and effective action” to avoid the collision in the Irish Sea, a report has revealed. The crew of the Royal Navy submarine had spotted the Stena Superfast V vessel seven minutes earlier – calculating its distance at , yards. But they turned across its path believing they had time to get clear.A two-year probe found the sub thought it was , yards away when the ferry swerved.It was actually a quarter of that.

It was played down by authorities at the time and its severity has only just emerged.It was also revealed it was the third time in four years that a submerged Royal Navy submarine had narrowly missed a collision. Andrew Moll, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents, said: “The lookout on board the ferry spotted a submarine’s periscope close ahead. “The Officer of the Watch then took immediate and effective action, turning the ferry to avoid a genuine risk of collision.”  He says underestimating the ferry’s speed and position led to “safety-critical decisions being made on inaccurate information”. The report adds that the ferry assessed “an imminent risk of collision [and] the OOW [Officer of the Watch] told the lookout to adopt hand-steering and, at :, ° of port rudder was applied.”And it warns: “This was the third [such] accident or incident in four years, which is a matter of signicant concern.” The Maritime Accident Investigations Branch said the control room’s electronic tactical display “presented a picture of a safer situation than reality.” The roll-on, roll-off ferry operates between Belfast and Cairnryan in Scotland, carrying up to , passengers.

The father and daughter lived together in the strange home until , when he passed away.

But while it meant she could have the le-saving surgery at last, it also marked the beginning of a ­desperate quest to find organs. Thalia has a condition called restrictive cardiomyopathy, which her grandmother Christine Johnson compares to “a ticking bomb”. Christine said: “She could have days, weeks or months. We just don’t know. We got the call we’d waited for for so long. I can’t put into words what that call meant.” The family are all too aware it will be a race against time for the child. But even in their hour of need they have made it their mission to appeal for potential organ donors – to save not just Thalia’s le but all the hundreds of other children waiting for that call. “We’re still a long way off,” ­Christine said. “We need a healthy heart and lungs that’s not just from someone with a blood group that is compatible with Thalia’s, but also approximately the same size. Thalia is one in a million andwe don’t have hope, we don’t have anything. Now we have hope like we haven’t felt in years.” The little girl was diagnosed with the heart condition in  a few days after her fourth birthday and the arrival of her brother Rudy. With no cure or treatment, the family was told her only hope lay in finding her new organs. But she was only assessed as being in enough need or fit enough to go on the list last week. She is in high dependency at Leeds General Infirmary after battling pneumonia and is the only child in the UK on the urgent donor waiting list for a heart and lungs. If or when that call finally comes, she will be blue-lighted to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to replace her organs with healthy ones and give her a chance at le. Thalia’s mum Ellie-Mae, , from Scarborough, North Yorks, said: “Within a week our family went from the euphoria of having a new baby to ­absolute devastation. “Thalia was so excited about turning four and having a little brother. It was like a kne had been placed in our hearts. “Thalia is the most energising, smiley little girl in the world, and for her to finally be on the list is what we’ve been praying for for so long. Of course we’ve a long way to go yet but this last week has felt like a massive step forwards.” Restrictive cardiomyopathy is an exceptionally rare muscle disease which stfens the ventricles around the heart, causing it to become enlarged.  Doctors at Scarborough Hospital noticed Thalia’s was swollen after she was admitted with a chest infection. She was quickly transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where the family were given the nightmare diagnosis. Then began the tortuous waiting game. “It was – and still is – the most horrible state of limbo, trying to pretend everything was normal, Thalia unable to understand how all the odds were stacked against her,” said Christine, , who helps care for her with her husband Simon, , Thalia’s grandfather.    After two further stays in Leeds General Infirmary, Thalia was then referred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for a heart transplant assessment. But Thalia wasn’t deemed to be a viable candidate because by then she had pulmonary hypertension, a secondary disease to her cardiomyopathy, meaning she now also needed a double lung transplant.  Thalia was then referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for a second opinion. She did relatively well for a long time after that initial diagnosis, Christine says, enjoying many largely carefree days at the family beach chalet near their home in Scarborough, starting school and a trip of a letime to Disneyland Paris. However,  brought a rapid decline in her health, with infections and complications meaning more time in hospital. The family shared Thalia’s story on social media to raise awareness of organ donation and to champion the NHS.Their Facebook page now has almost , followers and Thalia has met heroes including Lewis Capaldi and Jason Manford – although she still wants to meet her biggest idol, Stormzy. Christine said: “We’d never heard of restrictive cardio­myopathy, as the chances of having it are exactly what Thalia is to us... one in a million. She’s the most bubbly, sassy, beautul little girl, inside and out. It breaks all our hearts to think about what she’s got, what the future holds. “It’s such a hard thought to take in, knowing that another family’s whole world will come crashing down so that ours can be saved. “But the heart-breaking reality is that tragedies happen every day, where lives can’t be saved. It’s in those terrible circumstances we hope families can find it in themselves to save a le like Thalia’s.” Sadly this isn’t the first time the family have faced a member needing organ donation. Christine’s nephew and Thalia’s cousin, Alistair Haythorne, , has received three kidney transplants to date.He is currently on dialysis and will hopefully be listed for a fourth transplant in the near future – making the family all too aware of the need for organ donors. Nearly  children have died in the UK in the past  years waiting on the organ donor transplant list.  Angie Scales, NHS Blood and Transplant lead nurse for paediatric donation, says: “It’s so important for families to talk about organ donation and to include their children in those conversations. By saying yes to organ donation, families are in a position to give another family hope. “Donor families tell us they take great pride and comfort from the knowledge that they have helped to save lives.” Simon said the family has been contacted by “countless strangers around the world” saying how they have been inspired by Thalia to sign up to organ donor registers.

Ms Turner stated that she did not know when Meghan might make a bid for the White House - but it could be in the not too distant future, reports the Express. America is set to go to the polls in November with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden looking increasingly likely that he will replace incumbent Donald Trump.Ms Turner said: She will run for President, I have no doubt about it. I have no doubt, I think this is all part of the plan. It may not be very soon but it will be. A rather sceptical Jeremy Vine said it was the first time I have ever heard anyone say that. Ms Turner replied: I have it on fairly good authority that she would like to run for President There may be worse Presidents, I would like to see a mixed-race woman in the White House, I would. Mr Vine said: I don’t know whether woke wins elections, that is the problem here. Ms Turner asked: What do you mean by woke  Opinionated   Mr Vine responded: Woke is not aligning with where consensus is now, I suppose that is the thing.The Duchess of Sussex has hit out at the treatment by “those in the corridors of power” in her first speech since quitting her role in the royal family. In a pre-recorded video, Meghan spoke to the Girl Up  Leadership Summit, as part of a session called The Time Is Now. Speaking from her Los Angeles home, Meghan, , said: “I want to share something with you. “It’s that those in the halls and corridors and places of power, from lawmakers and world leaders to executives, all of those people, they depend on you more than you will ever depend on them. “And here’s the thing: they know this. “They know that all of you, at a younger age than any modern comparison, are setting the tone for an equitable humanity. Not figuratively, literally. “This is a humanity that desperately needs you.  “To push it, to push us, forcefully in a more inclusive, more just, and more empathetic direction. “To not only frame the debate, but be in charge of the debate—on racial justice, gender, climate change, mental health and wellbeing, on civic engagement, on public service, on so much more. “That’s the work you’re already out there doing.” Meghan and husband Prince Harry left their royal roles officially in March and now live in a friend’s borrowed £million mansion. In recent weeks they have criticised the Commonwealth’s “uncomfortable past” while Meghan has hit out at her treatment at the hands of the royal family saying she felt “unprotected”.

I literally couldnapost believe the size of the monster jellyfish. Lots of people gathered round to see what the fuss was. There were lots of gasps of disbelief, and some people that were still in the water quickly made their way back on to the beach.I wonderitaposs to do with the very warm weather we have had in the last few weeks, but it looked like something out of a film.Itaposs the first time Iaposve seen jellyfish on the south coast this year, although we did see a small swarm off Tolcarne beach a couple of weeks ago.

The phase  trial in healthy adult volunteers, which began in April, showed the vaccine generated an immune response, with blood samples indicating it stimulated the body to produce both antibodies and killer T-cells, the Dailyreported. It came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said teams were working towards a best case scenario of a vaccine being made available some time this year, although he conceded it was more likely in . David Carpenter, chairman of the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, which approved the Oxford trial and continues to work with scientists on amendments, told thethat the team were absolutely on track. They can strengthen findings by targeting people in hospitals, healthcare professionals, where the spread is [more] likely to happen, he said. Nobody can put final dates... things might go wrong but the reality is that by working with a big pharma company, that vaccine could be fairly widely available around September and that is the sort of target they are working on. But a source told the newspaper that the results did not yet prove that the Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx nCoV-, provides long-lasting immunity. I can tell you that we now know the Oxford vaccine covers both bases - it produces both a T cell and an antibody response, the source said. Itaposs the combination of these two that will hopefully keep people safe. So far, so good. Itaposs an important moment. But we still have a long way to go.  Speaking on ITVaposs Peston on Wednesday evening, Mr Hancock said: Weaposre all working towards the best case scenario, weaposre all giving AstraZeneca and the team at Oxford, and the Imperial vaccine, every possible support, weaposre working with the other potential vaccines around the world, in America, and Germany, and the Netherlands. Weaposre working with them to ensure thatthey come off first, that weaposll get access to them here. But this is an inexact science and itaposs at risk.

Packed housing is one of the reasons people in Blackburn, Darwen and Pendle have been advised to wear face masks indoors to avoid local lockdowns. In the borough of Blackburn with Darwen household visiting has been reduced to one household plus two members from another household. Officials say infections are spreading rapidly among ethnic minority communities who live in big families. Director of public health Prof Dominic Harrison said: “These steps will help and we are appealing to everyone in Blackburn with Darwen to follow them to protect themselves and their loved ones. “If we don’t, a local lockdown, like in Leicester, becomes a very real possibility.” He added: “We know that they are in mainly south-Asian areas, and they are in areas with high number of terraced houses with high numbers of occupants in the house, so four or more, five or more people in the household.” Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog He said % of the  new cases were people from South Asian backgrounds. More lockdown measures would be introducedcases were not falling by July . Council leader Mohammed Khan said: “Le cannot go back to normal just yet, and we must all make sacrices to avoid a local lockdown. “Please continue to do your bit to stick to the rules to protect yourself and your family.” It comes as the Government is set to make a decision soon on whether to extend the city-wide lockdown in Leicester. There the rate has risen from  per , of population, up to  in the week ending Saturday. But this is down from . in the seven days to  June. Pendle has also advised residents to “limit large extended family gatherings inside” after recording the second highest number of cases in the country at . per ,. It saw a dramatic increase, particularly in the Nelson and Brierfield areas, in the week up to Saturday from . per ,. It also has a large ethnic minority population. Lancashire’s director of public health Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said: “We need your help now to... keep Pendle out of lockdown.” Other towns with high infection rates include Rochdale, Bradford, Peterborough and Luton. Stricter measures to curb the virus have been introduced in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire, following  new cases in the past week. Confirmed cases in the Blackburn with Darwen borough has gone up to  per ,. This is a rise from . cases in the seven days to July . The local authority of , people has called on people to bump elbows in place of handshakes and hugs. Residents are being told to wear cloth face coverings in all enclosed public spaces, including workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres and hair and beauty salons.  Prof Harrison said: “We have what we call a rising tide event rather than an outbreak. “By that we mean that we’ve got a number of cases rising in specic areas across a signicant community, but not a single big outbreak like other areas that had a workplace outbreak. “And when we look at the data what we can see is clusters in a part of the town, but the clusters are household clusters.” Big families looking after elderly relatives may be a factor in outbreaks but officials have warned against stigmatising certain ethnic groups. Around a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s , population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani heritage population. Blackburn councillor Saima Afzal said: “It should be a concern to anybodyany community is stigmatised and we know the facts are there, we are open about those facts.” “You go home and you are caring for a family member, or there are three or four families living under one household, because of economic reasons, or financial issues. “The Asian community do do that, they pool their resources together to help the whole family survive.

The -year-old, who is part of Britain’s biggest family the Radfords, is expecting her first baby who she is calling Ophelia in September.Sharing the adorable picture on Instagram, Millie wrote: “ weeks until we get to meet Baby I can’t wait to meet you.”Excited grandma-to-be Sue Radford replied saying: “Counting down the weeks till we get to hold you Ophelia we love you so much already.” Millie is preparing for her daughteraposs arrival with a stunning nursery decorated in animal prints, adorable personalised blankets and a stylish white crib where Ophelia will sleep. Generous super-mum Sue reduced the teen to tears when she treated her to a haul of baby items including a brand new pram. But with restrictions in place due the lockdown, Millieaposs pregnancy hasn’t been what she expected. Sharing a pic of her baby bump at  weeks she confessed: “I’m gutted I haven’t had the chance to enjoy this pregnancy like I wanted to because of lockdown. No baby shopping, no listening to babyaposs heartbeat, no sharing this experience with my friends or family.  When Millie announced she was expecting she said she as worried as Sue was  week pregnant with her nd birthday with husband Noel. She said: “My parents have always seen me as the ‘good girl’. They are not strict but I knew that telling them would make it real. “Thankfully, they weren’t disappointed. They were excited.” Sue went on to give birth to Heidie in April which means the tot will become an auntie at the young age of just five months when Ophelia arrives.  Heidie joins her siblings Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, nine, Oscar, eight, Casper, seven, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, Archie, two, Bonnie, one and Millie. Millie said she hopes the tiny age gap means the two girls will be close growing up. She added: “It’s weird that my baby will have an aunt who is only five months older. But it means they’ll hopefully be really close.” The Radford family recently revealed how busy they have been during lockdown by adding a bar, play area and outdoor cinema to their -bedroom home.

The Cambridge kids looked adorable in their little outfits as they were ushered into the church by their mum the Duchess of Cambridge. Unlike Kateaposs wedding to Prince William, the celebration was a private affair but well-wishers and members of the press were outside the church to see Pippa and her husband-to-be James Matthews arrive. While most people loved the excitement of the almost-royal wedding, the big day was a bit too much for some of the younger guests and little George got a tad upset. The Queenaposs great-grandson, usually the master of the polite smile and wave, broke down in tears after the ceremony at St Markaposs Church in Englefield, Berkshire, in . The poor little prince had already had enough as he left the church and was pictured pulling a face as he led the rest of the children scattering confetti in front of Pippa and her new husband. As they made their way over to the cars waiting to whisk them off to the reception, Kate turned to her son and gave him a stern telling off. It included the famous aposthataposs enough nowapos finger point, a universal hand gesture recognised by stressed mothers everywhere, and left George in tears.  According to the Daily Mail, he was in trouble after Kate spotted him purposely stepping on the train of Pippaaposs white lace Giles Deacon wedding dress. The little prince spotted Charlotte doing it, so decided to have a go himself. Oh dear... And the prince wasnapost the only page boy acting up, as one appeared to stick out his tongue and pull a dubious finger gesture - right under Kateaposs nose.  The bridesmaids on the big day were Countess Philippa Hoyos, Lily French, Avia Horner and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, with Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire, William Ward and Prince George acting as page boys. But allaposs well that ends well, as the young Prince soon appeared to forget his tantrum, and resume smiling sweetly and waving to the media as the cars drove the wedding party to the reception at the Middletonsapos family home. To the princeaposs credit, he played his role perfectly as he arrived at the ceremony, looking angelic as he prepared to walk down the aisle. Adorably dressed in a white shirt, green trousers and long white socks, big brother George even appeared to help his sister Charlotte carry her flower arrangement. But just before the ceremony got started, the Duchess was spotted shushing the children as they got a little too caught up in the buzz of the day. While this upset was short and sweet, itaposs not the first time heaposs had a wobble in public. Back in , he almost lost his cool at his sisteraposs christening, before a quick pep talk from his dad perked him right back up again. After the ceremony, the newly married couple took a short drive to Pippaaposs parentsapos home in the nearby village of Bucklebury, where staff were waiting to dispense champagne and canapes to the happy revellers. The evening do at the marquee at the Middleton family home was for adults only, with a five-course meal, drinks and dancing until the small hours.  Guests included royals Kate, William, Harry and Princess Beatrice, plus celebs including Made in Cha star Spencer Matthews - the groomaposs brother - and tennis ace Roger Federer.Keen not to steal the show from her younger sister, the Duchess wore an understated but very elegant outfit by Alexander McQueen, who designed her wedding dress back in ."},{"url":null,"title":"single mum left sleeping floor","story":"NewsSingle mum left sleeping on floor after paying £ for broken bed on FacebookSophie Adamson said she bought the bed from a page on Facebook, but after collecting it, she found it all broken when she tried to put it up and the page has since blocked herShareCommentsByNathan StandleyJamie Hawkins:,  JUL NewsSophie said the £ bed was badly damaged when she collected it \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Met Officeweather charts show plenty of warm weather and sunny skies between now and the end of the weekend - with the heat peaking on Friday afternoon.Previous forecasts had suggested Brits would have to wait until Saturday for Mediterranean highs, preceded by days of cloud and rain. Meteorologist Clare Nasir said Thursday will be a better day all around than yesterday outside of the northwest of the country, with highs of C and sunshine for many. North and southeast Scotland, northeast England, eastern parts of Wales and central southern England will be the favoured spots for seeing some sunshine. This will help temperatures up into the s, said Ms Nasir. While Friday looks even better, with BBC forecaster Darren Bett describing tomorrow as the peak of the heat for the next few days - with warm air bringing highs of C in London. However, he added that temperatures over the weekend are going to slowly ebb away due to strengthening wind and patchy rain - though Saturday will still see highs of C and Sunday C in the south.  The hot and dry weather wonapost be felt by all, with Ms Nasir warning a bank of rain and wind will arrive across western Scotland this evening, moving down across central Scotland and Northern Ireland. On Friday, she said: Many of us will see some brighter weather - it will feel warmer south of the rain band, with some sunshine coming through. That rain band pushes down towards the far north of England, [and] extends towards northern parts of Wales.  She added: Into the weekend it continues its passage southwards, with some fresher air to arrive in the north and also some sunshine.

Anna Wellinska of Armley, Leeds has been tormented and abused by a group of young people for two years.The youngest member of the group is just eight-years-old, Leeds Live reported.During the latest confrontation Anna decided to film the kind of abuse she has been receiving.

The mumaposs frantic search for her child ended in heartbreak as she found her child unresponsive inside a vehicle. Police are not filing charges following the July  death in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, according to US reports.According to weather forecasts the state recorded highs of C that day. The case has sparked a stark warning young kids could be more at risk of climbing into hot cars unnoticed this summer as stressed parents juggle work and home-schooling during coronavirus lockdowns.For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, visit our liveblog here    Hopkinsville Detective Sergeant Todd DeArmond told local station WHOP News Radio the girlaposs mum told police she began looking for her daughter after noticing her missing.It is believed the girl got inside the vehicle on her own, according to the report. Emergency services took the girl to hospital where she was pronounced dead, a coroner said. No other details on the incident have been released, and the girlaposs identity is not yet known. But according to a United States organisation that works to raise awareness about the dangers of unattended children and vehicles the little girl died after gaining access to a vehicle on her own.  We are currently much lower than the average number of hot car deaths for this time of year due to the pandemic, but we are concerned that the numbers will increase as routines continue to sht and families begin going back to work, Kids AndCars president Janette Fennell said. Nine children have already died in hot cars in the UK this year, according to the organisationaposs data On average around  children die in hot cars in the US by this time of year, the nonprofit said. According to the websiteaposs data,  children nationwide died last year from vehicular heatstroke,  died in , and  lost their lives in . According to the Park Look Lock campaign, many cases of vehicular heatstroke involve children who were unknowingly left in vehicles or forgotten. However the pandemic brought a higher risk of young children getting into trouble climbing into unlocked cars and boots to play, then finding they canapost escape, according to the campaign. A four-year-old boy died of heatstroke in that horrible way in Tomball, Texas just this April, the advocates warned. According to its analysis of past tragedies, children aged two and three are most at risk as they are old enough to clamber into vehicles alone - but lack the ability to get out. The highest risk days for children dying in hot cars are typically Saturday and Sunday when children are at home and not school. However, the campaign warned that Covid- lockdowns measures were seeing more children normally at nursery school being home-schooled.

Oklahomaaposs Kevin Stitt said he had been diagnosed for the deadly disease as new infections in his state and neighbouring Texas surged by record numbers for a second straight day. But the -year-old Republican - who has backed one of the countryaposs most aggressive re-opening plans following lockdown - said he still respects peopleaposs rights...to not wear a mask. Speaking via video link from his home, where he is isolating, he made the bizarre claims that forcing people to wear masks would be dficult because they can easily slip down below your nose. The governor, who has regularly neglected to wear a mask himself, also received backlash this week after tweeting a photo with his mask-free children in a busy restaurant. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Texas, where the tally of known infections jumped by an all-time high of , cases statewide during the past  hours, also reported a record  additional Covid- deaths,i ts fourth such daily benchmark this month.But Oklahoma, which reported a daily record of , cases, became a focal point of the resurgent coronavirus outbreak after Stittaposs announcement. A staunch supporter of Donald Trump, he attended the presidentaposs indoor campaign rally in Tulsa along with thousands of others three weeks ago - where many didnapost wear masks.I got tested yesterday for Covid-, and the results came back positive, Stitt said in a video conference call with reporters.  I feel fine, really, I mean you might say Iaposm asymptomatic or just slightly kind of a little bit achy. The governor is one of a number of elected leaders infected since the novel coronavirus arrived in the United States this year. Others include US Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, and about half a dozen members of the US House of Representatives, from both parties. Stittaposs diagnosis comes amid an upswing in Covid- cases across the American South and West after state and local officials started loosening economic and social restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Across the country, new cases have been averaging around , a day.  Twenty-eight states have registered record daily increases in cases this month, many of them more than once, and  states have reported a greater number of deaths for a single day than ever before. Nationally, the total number of cases was nearing . million, by far the highest number of any country in the world, and more than , Americans have died from the highly contagious respiratory illness to date. Since Trumpaposs June  rally in Tulsa, attended by several thousand people against the advice of public health officials, coronavirus cases in the surrounding county have risen to over ,.  Thataposs a % increase over the last four weeks. The number of infections in several other Oklahoma counties have likewise doubled, tripled or even quadrupled over the same period. Eight staff on Trumpaposs campaign tested positive around the time of the Tulsa event. Stitt said he had worked with contact tracers when his symptoms developed and they believed he would not have been contagious before Saturday.  An influential mortality model developed by the University of Washingtonaposs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluationprojected late on Tuesday that the US death toll would surpass , by November , up , from a prior forecast. But it also said the number of lives lost could be reduced by ,nearly all Americans wore masks in public. Trump, whose popularity in opinion polls is declining ahead of the election, has been reluctant to embrace mask-wearing, and most Republican governors and local officials have followed suit.  With infections surging for a second straight day in Alabama and a record daily death total there, Republican Governor Kay Ivey on Wednesday reversed her position and ordered all residents to wear masks, starting Thursday. I always prefer a personal responsibility over a government mandate, Ivey said at a briefing. And yet I also know with all my heart that the numbers and the data over the past few weeks are definitely trending in the wrong direction.

He came across a aposflattenedapos area of woodland where a number of trees had snapped and fallen down. Ben, who lives in Plymouth, couldnapost help but wonderthere was more to the discovery as he thought the way the trees had snapped was strange.Eventually, he decided the destruction might have been caused by aliens, reports Plymouth Live.He said: Found a crash site in the woods - could be UFO. I stopped to take the dog for a walk in the woods today as weaposre camping.He went on to describe the area as being eerie and claimed he heard weird sounds and felt like he was being watched.However, experts arenapost convinced an alien landing is responsible for the fallen trees and have instead shared their own theories.Forestry England pointed out that UK woodland areas are no stranger to UFO sightings, but they thought in this instance aposwindblowapos had caused the damage. A spokesperson for Forestry England said: The nation’s forests are no stranger to UFO sightings, as debate continues to rage about the legendary  sighting in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk.  The aposalien crash siteapos near Meddon actually looks like ‘windblow’ to us. This happens when trees are destabilised by strong winds and the first ones to fall can topple their neighbours in a dramatic domino effect. They added: What has happened at Meddon could be a clever trick by aliens to disguise a landing, but perhaps not fool proof, as Ben’s dramatic discovery shows. We still think itaposs windblow.A spokesperson for The Met Office has also taken a look at photos of the trees and they believe a mini tornado or funnel cloud is responsible. They told Plymouth Live: I suspect this has been caused by a funnel cloud or mini tornado that may have just touched down at that point in the woods causing the trees to snap and fall into each other."},{"url":null,"title":"mum shares foolproof way clean","story":"NewsMum shares foolproof way to clean your microwave without using cleaning productsThe mums simple hack guarantees a sparkling microwave in five minutes, and theres no scrubbing involved at allShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience WriterKayla Walsh:,  JUL NewsYou only need two ingredients \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Donning the face coverings to hide their youthful looks, they make a few adjustments to their clothing and hair and find themselves walking out of the stores with bags of drink, before posting the results on social media. The craze is sweeping the video sharing social media app TikTok as the teens exploit the coronavirus crisis to avoid being asked for ID for the alcohol. Multiple videos show underage drinkers applying white powder to their hair to mimic the greying locks of senior citizens and donning older-style clothes before dropping in on the liquor store. One even decided to don medical gloves to hide her youthful skin on her hands, while the mask covered her young face. Unsurprisingly, several video posts have gone viral, with some in the millions of views. Some describe the videos as apospranksapos but others were quick to point out it was illegal. On TikTok, one -year-old said she used baby powder in her hair and tucked some into a scarf to make her look aposmatronlyapos. Complete with sunglasses and face covering, she managed to buy a bottle of wine without being challenged. Excited, she tells her followers she is shaking.She added thatshe had been challenged to provide ID, she would have said I had forgotten it in the car and left the store. Another viral hit shows a girl of unknown age apply her costume in her bedroom before driving to a shop. Accompanied by pals, she puts on an OAP mask from a costume shop, with fake hair that covers her face.  Her mates film her secretively as she walks through the shop, mimicking the frail gait of an elderly lady. She emerges victorious with a shopping bag packed with tins of booze, as her friends laugh excitedly. While some have crazed the teens for their creativity, others point out it is illegal and that posting the evidence on social media might not be the smartest move.  In the UK, everyone will have to wear face coverings inside a shop nine days from now. The new rules, which come into play on July , are being welcomed by most in the medical community. If you fail to cover your face while visiting a supermarket or High Street shop you may be fined £.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that. It is definitely exciting times.”Former Rangers and Dunfermline man Clark was a key component of the Tangerines’ Championship title winning squad from last term.He is now hoping Mellon gives him and the other medal winners a chance to prove they can do it in the Premiership.Clark added: “The boys were excellent last season and we deservedly won the league although it wasn’t the way we wanted it to be.“At the end of the day we are champions and it is good to hear the manager will give us a chance.“However, we all know that he will bring in some new faces and over the next few days and weeks because he will want to strengthenthere are areas where he feels he needs to strengthen.“We will have to work hard and keep strivingwe want to keep raising the standards to meet the challenge of the Premiership week in, week out.”Clark ed from six months out with an ankle injury in a - friendly defeat at Motherwell on Saturday.It wasn’t the result the Terrors were after but the former Queen of the South man was just delighted to get back on the pitch.He commented: “It was a good run out.

It’s lovely to be back and see the pub open again.”With the re-opening of pubs came guidelines for landlords to follow and Ronnie Bissell, who runs the Occidental, has introduced safety measures for the benefit of his customers.He has also had to restrict the number of revellers he can have in at any one time.“We have put lots of things in place to allow us to open and keep our customers safe,” Ronnie said.“I’ve arranged a one-way system, no one is allowed to stand at the bar, tables are separated to comply with social distancing and I’m taking customers details as they arrive.“This is a busy wee bar and I’m happy to see everyone who has come along today.“I’m optimistic about the future and it’s business as usual.”In The Ambassador on Clepington Road, a family group of Lennox Dempster, , Tracey Napier, , and David Mitchell, , were enjoying a drink.Lennox said: “We’re really enjoying being able to come back to our local.”David added: “There are guidelines in place to keep everyone safe and as long as everyone sticks to them I think it will all work out fine.”Licensee Kate Fraser said: “It’s just great to welcome people back after all this time.”At the Balgay Bar, owner Paul Murphy was delighted to get started again.He said: #I’ve been getting ready to reopen for a while now.“The kegs are filled and I’ve been looking forward to getting started up again.“We are asking our customers to work with us and we will implement as many safety precautions as we can.”Karen Rollo at the Boars Rock on Arbroath Road is hopeful for the future. She said: “We’ve redecorated during the closure and we#re all ready to welcome our customers.“With the recommended safety measures in place I think everything will work out great.“We’re optimistic about the future.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

However, it also stresses the importance of visiting these places in a responsible manner and following social distancing rules. vw, px\"  With the campaign now under way, leading city figures have shown their support for its launch.Stephen Gow, vice-chairman of the Aberdeen City and Shire Hotels Association, said: “The hospitality industry, along with many other industries, has suffered a complete loss of income since March this year. It is essential that now we are able to open our businesses – albeit in a very limited manner – we gain as much support as we can locally.“The north-east of Scotland is full of great businesses and for these to survive we need to ensure both locals and near neighbours feel safe and confident in the measures that have been put in place, to encourage them to use these businesses once again.“Without a strong and vibrant hospitality industry, the region will be much slower to recover and have far less to offer in the future.“We hope this campaign will help remind everyone in our region there are amazing places to go and see and fantastic hospitality businesses waiting to welcome them in a manner that is both safe and enjoyable.”Adrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired, added: “Understanding the growing importance of tourism to our city and shire, we fully support Visit Aberdeenshire’s Rediscover Your Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire campaign, raising awareness of what the north-east has to offer at a time when the custom is most needed.“As international travel restrictions are still easing, we potentially have a signicant domestic market that may look to do a dferent holiday this year and with that closer to home – and, of course, the north-east of Scotland has much to offer in that regard.“The campaign will not only give a great insight into the quality of the product on offer, but hopefully help attract many more tourists, local or from slightly further afield, safely to Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, and in so doing help safeguard many jobs in our tourism and hospitality sectors.”The campaign – involving the Evening Express, The Press and Journal, Society and Original  – will have its own dedicated section on the VisitAberdeenshire website, where people can explore blogs with ideas for things to do.Locals are also being asked to share an image of their favourite thing to do in the north-east – including viewpoints, beaches, castles, walks, food or experiences – via social media, using the hashtag #RediscoverABDN and tagging @visitabdn and this will run throughout the campaign.Chris Foy, CEO of VisitAberdeenshire, said: “Local people play an important role in supporting the recovery of tourism in the region while enjoying some amazing experiences across the city and shire.“Unlike visitors from further afield, locals need little notice to plan a day, an evening or even an overnight to rediscover our region.“The opportunity for many businesses to welcome back guests follows hot on the heels of self-catering and outdoor dining experiences re-opening earlier in the month.“But there is a long way to go. Easing of restrictions just gets much of the sector back to the starting line.”For more information, visit yourabdnVisitAberdeenshire, the Evening Express, The Press and Journal, Society and Original  are encouraging people to share an image of their favourite part of the north-east throughout the #RediscoverABDN campaign.

It’s a strange and unequal setup.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “These claims are simply not true. Dentists are now permitted, under our route map for dentistry, to offer routine treatment with the exception of aerosol generating procedures which continue to be available through our hub service for those in urgent need.“We understand that due to capacity issues and the build-up of people requiring treatment over the lockdown that practices will be prioritising their services for those most in need.“The health and safety of all patients and staff attending dental practices remains our primary consideration and in taking a phased approach we are seeking to balance the overall risk of infection with the needs of patients to be seen by dentists. Our overarching aim is to save lives.“As part of Phase  the Chief Dental Officer has commissioned an expert review of aerosol generating proceduresand will be writing to the profession shortly on how they might be introduced safely in practice.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

against cruise ship travel at this time.ldquoThis is due to the ongoing pandemic and is based on medical advice from Public Health England.ldquoThe government will continue to review its cruise ship travel advice based on the latest medical advice.ldquoIf you have future cruise travel plans, you should speak to your travel operator, or the travel company you booked with, for further advice.ldquoThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to support the Department for Transportrsquos work with industry for the resumption of international cruise travel.Previous advice issued by the FCO on March  said that British nationals aged seven and above, as well as those with underlying health conditions, should not travel on cruise ships.What does it mean for planned holidays The updated travel advice means that many who have future holidays booked on a cruise ship risk having their trips cancelled or postponed.Responding to the update, Rory Boland, editor of consumer magazine Which  Travel, said\"The FCOs advice against cruise ship travel will lead to most upcoming cruises being cancelled or postponed.\"Most cruise holiday customers should be legally entitled to a cash refund within  days under the package travel regulations, but as weve seen across the travel industry recently, operators facing a surge in refund claims are often taking longer tocustomers money to them.\"If refunds will be delayed, cruise companies must urgently let customers know and give a clear timetable for when money will be ed.\"The FCO should also extend its warning to include a definitive date, to give operators and customers clarity over when it will be safe to rebook.\"PO Cruises, the biggest cruise line in the UK, has suspended all of its sailings until

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"hurrah-pubs-reopening---love-even-worst","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty.

Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of going too slowly she has been accused of going too quickly. She has been accused of simply copying actions taken by Downing Street and she has been accused of taking Scotland on a dferent path from that being pursued in England. She is damnedshe does and she is damnedshe does not. Things though must be pretty desperate for her criticsour First Minister is now attacked for her choice of personal protection. The letter by Dr Edwardssuggesting that for Nicola Sturgeon to wear a tartan face covering is somehow politicising the pandemic is frankly risible. He claims that she aspires to be some sort of \"super heroine\" on a mission to \"save Scotland\". What nonsense.There are two problems for Dr Edwards and his fellow-critics. Firstly he should read the Daily Update figures printed each day on Page  of The Herald. Here he will see the dramatic fall in the number of infections recorded in Scotland over the past weeks added to that the fact that at the time of writing, for the last five days there have been no deaths attributable to the virus. If he casts his eye further down to look at the UK figures. then he will see quite a dferent story. Frankly I find it depressing that the undoubted success achieved thus far by the Scottish Government working with our NHS and care workers in suppressing the virus is never acknowledged by critics such as Dr Edwards.The other problem for such critics is the fact that the steady, thoughtful, progress being charted through this pandemic by the Scottish Government, and so clearly articulated by Nicola Sturgeon, has won the support of the vast majority of Scots.There are more than enough examples of the failings of the UK Government to keep your correspondents busy just now. Your report in the same issue that since January of this year some , children have been admitted to English hospitals suffering from the effects of malnutrition is truly shocking. This scandal has now been followed by details of the new immigration policy for the post-Brexit UK . This will hit hard key Scottish industries such as hospitality, tourism and agriculture. Furthermore, it is a shameful way to treat the large numbers of our migrant care workers on whom we have come to depend, several of whom have lost their lives during this crisis.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I HAVE taken to summarising Guy Stenhouses articles, to save me reading them in future, and perhaps saving him from writing them.His summary of governmental responses to Covid  is: Scottish Government bad, Westminster Government good.He is right that patients were sent from hospital to residential care without Covid testing Business, July , but no one was discharged with symptoms.It was not known at the time that asymptomatic patients would spread the disease so effectively. The lack of a crystal ball was present throughout the UK and patients were discharged from hospitals in England in the same circumstances. Strange that Mr Stenhouse is not also asking for Matt Hancocks head on a plate.Its also unfortunate that Boris Johnsons announcement of compulsory face masks in shops came too late for his article. Otherwise, he could have pointed out that Nicola Sturgeon was again following the Westminster line, and that Boris had preceded her by at least minus  days.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.THE letter from your correspondent L MacGregormust be an attempt to break the world record for the number of exaggerations, deliberate distortions, misrepresentation and downright lies that can be fitted into a single missive. In a way we should perhaps thank her for her summing up of the tissue of mendacity upon which the case for Scottish independence so heavily relies.These range from the insistence on best-case scenariosto utter fantasyvia financial irresponsibilityto that good old favourite the Independence Time Machine , throwing in for good measure the wilful misrepresentation of the devolved fisheries border of  as an oil field border. The rest of the claims in the letter are also rubbish of the same order.The SNP has recently been advised by a tame academic professor of marketing to abandon facts and tell stories instead ndash a lesson learned from Donald Trump and Aaron Banks and his successful Brexit campaign . Its followers are obviously quick learners.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.AFTER the human misery and predictable economic failure of a partitioned East Germany, West Germany paid heavily for the reunication, investing billions into the East. If Scotland ever becomes independent and when it inevitably failsit can expect no such support from England because of the toxic anti-English rhetoric that is the default position of the economic theory-free zone of the nationalists. Broke and desperate, our future will for sure be as a recipient of ldquoaid from Moscow or Beijing. Can I suggest that even Boris Johnson is preferable to Putin or Xi Jinping John Dunlop, Ayr.IN response to Janice MacKay , Scotland was a country long before most of the present countries of Europe and for some centuries before the United States was cobbled together from the ious territories stolen from the inhabitants. Scotland is an inidual country just as England is, and the fact that it is shackled to England by an unfair Treaty of Union does not negate its existence as a nation. When devolution was eventually prised out of Westminster, some small elements of government were restored to Scotland in the hope that this gesture would prevent the natives becoming any more restless. It did not work.Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh EH.WE are currently bombarded in the media by the views of experts. My Chambers dictionary defines an expert as one who is skilled in any art or science.In his letter today , Douglas Cowe rightly places the word \"experts\" in inverted commas.After listing the supposed benefits of Scottish independence, L McGregor recommends that I read some of the work of true experts, whatever that means, like Dr Tim Rideout. Dr Rideout speaks, of course, in favour of an independent Scotland. Some \"experts\" lean to the political left, some to the right, some to unionism and some to Scottish nationalism.One can iniably find an \"expert\" who happens to suit ones own political leanings.Experts as defined by Chambers are, after all, human.David Miller, Milngavie.THE figures quoted by your columnist Kirsty Hughesto the effect that  per cent of Scottish voters ndash versus % in England ndash would wish to rejoin the EU seems to show that there has been little change in the disposition of overall electoral views regarding Brexit.However, it must lay to rest one belief held by some Remainers: that the narrow margin of victory for Leave in the referendum was due to the larger dferential turnout of elderly voters.Just over four years have passed since the referendum.

In the case of Labour, part of its traditional working class support is hard on criminal justice, and in the SNP, the less progressive wing of the movement partly explains the creation of new pro-independence parties led by voices whorsquove been sceptical on issues such as trans rights.:Mark Smith: Anti-Scottish  I think Irsquom finally facing up to my prejudiceWhat all this means is we should remember wersquore not really as progressive as we think we are and that, while support for the death penalty has dropped from about two-thirds in the s, it is still extraordinary that half the Scottish population thinks itrsquos a good idea for the state to kill people. They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion. The death penalty was abolished in the s even though the vast majority of people supported it, so presumably the reverse could happen and a future government could ignore public opinion and reintroduce it.: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooItrsquos also worth remembering that, although support for the death penalty has dropped since the s, it has dropped at a very slow rate. Yes, itrsquos   now, but think about this: therersquos a good chance that every second person in Scotland will look at the executions of Billy Wardlow and Daniel Lewis Lee during a global effort to save lives and think: good, justice has been served, job done.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

From my involvement I can confidently state that the one constant in this situation has been the rapidity by which the volume and quality of data relating to the virus has increased and knowledge and understanding of its impact has informed the need to adapt our response to reflect this.At the outset each country took its own stance relative to the scientic evidence available at the time. Inevitably this stance was clearly informed by politics and we can see the results of that by a comparison, albeit simplistic, between, for example, New Zealand and the United States.The situation in which we now find ourselves across the UK reflects this. At the outset the available science within the UK led the Westminster and the devolved governments to the same starting point. However, as the scientic evidence grew, Westminster chose one path while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland took a dferent approach which reflected the same principles as those countries throughout the world who sought to eliminate rather than contain the virus.The evidence now clearly suggests this path has been the more circumspect, while only time will tell whether it proves to be wholly successful. What is clear, however, is that the actions of the devolved governments have been taken based around a structured and strategic response to evidence rather than, as appears to be the case, a series of ill-considered reactions to prevailing political dynamics that seems to characterise the Westminster administration.It has also been the case that far from relying on \"common sense\" as promoted by the politicians, those tasked with ing the athletes to training have been extremely prescriptive about what constitutes good, and safe practice leaving no room for doubt as to what is required. While that may appear to be dictatorial and imposing on an iniduals freedom, in reality one inidual not complying with protocols can have a serious effect on everyone  around them.These are unprecedented times, calling for clarity and effective governance. I leave it to others to determine the degree to which this has been achieved across the UK.Bill Mitchell, Kyle of Lochalsh.I HAVE had asthma all my le, and contrary to what youre told, after five decades it never gets any easier. I also have dficulty wearing the now-mandatory facemask for a prolonged period - after two hours I am struggling to breathe, and am obliged to head home to take it off.But the crux of the matter is none of us should be staying out longer than necessary anyway. To paraphrase the old rabies adverts, Covid- is still a killer.To those bleating about their \"freedom\", would you sooner have \"cabin fever\" or Covid- fever  Until theres a reliable cure, thats the gamble you take with your own le and everyone you come into contact with.Israel and the United States are now paying horric prices for their complacency and hubris - let their fate be our warning.Mark Boyle, Johnstone."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-facemask-hostility-predictable---seen-everything-seatbelts-vaccines","story":"It was described as a \"monstrous imposition\" by Tory MP Desmond Swayne, while on Twitter the hashtag #Muzzle took off as opponents bemoaned being told what to do by ministers.The tone had Trumpian undercurrents at times, echoing the presidents comments to a journalist wearing a facemask during a recent press conference when he mocked him for \"wanting to be politically correct\".And hand-in-hand with the characterisation of a public health measure as nanny-statism or a nefarious attack on liberty came the claims that facemasks themselves could harm your health.For this, see the proleration of internet posts relating to pulse oximeters where cynics had used them to measure supposed declines in their blood oxygen levels while sitting at home wearing masks.: Antibody study suggests less than % of Scotlands population has been infected with coronavirus so farThere is no actual scientic evidence that wearing masks can cause hypoxia - but plenty of evidence that catching coronavirus will. And anyone with serious breathing dficulties such as asthma is exempt anyway.Compared to England and the US - where there have been public protests against mandatory facemasks - hostility to the rule in Scotland has not been so pronounced, perhaps because we have less of a libertarian tradition.But among those who are opposed the same tropes emerge: dislike of being told what to dosuspicions that it might actually be harmful and scepticism of the evidence.What is interesting though, is that all this follows a well-worn template. Take seatbelts, for example.No one expects it to be routinely enforced by the police we do it because it could potentially save our own or others lives in a crash.But there was a time when seatbelts were considered controversial.The state of Wisconsin in the US was the first place to make front seatbelts a legal requirement in all cars built from  onwards.By then, there had already been fierce debate for  years that they might do more harm than good - for example, that they might cause internal injuries or make it more dficult to escape a vehicle which was ablaze or submerged in water. There were claims it would be safer to be \"thrown clear\".There were also arguments that wearing them should be a personal choice, not a legal mandate. Some car owners cut the seatbelts out of their cars in protest.: Slower exit from lockdown has had marginal effect on Covid infections and deathsAs recently as the s most Americans did not use them, and  per cent were opposed to them being enforced by law. As with muzzles for facemasks, seatbelts were depicted as tying up drivers.All this came against a backdrop of a landmark exposeacute in  - Unsafe at Any Speed - by consumer protection campaigner, Ralph Nader, which revealed car manufacturers reluctance to sacrice profits for safety features, despite mounting evidence around preventable death and injury.By the early s both the US and UK were finally making the wearing of seatbelts a legal requirement for drivers and front seat passengers. In, the law was extended in the UK to children in backseats, and to adults sitting in the rear from .Compliance among drivers and passengers is now well over % in Britain, with non-seatbelt wearers accounting for a disproportionate share of road crash fatalities - % in .Vaccination is another area of public health where the science around its benefits has become polluted by conspiracy theories and, of course, the persistent  claims of a link between MMR and autism.Some of the hostility is rooted in ignorance about the science, or scepticism about the motives of \"profiteering\" pharmaceutical companies. But it is also a simple dislike for \"being told what to do\".Immunisation is only effective in terms of creating herd immunityenough of the population comply. If enough people are vaccinated, a given infection has little opportunity to spread.: Why some scientists think handwashing and distancing might be insufficient to limit Covid spreadThat not only protects those who are immunised, but those with health conditions that make vaccination too dangerous. Nonetheless, making vaccination compulsory remains controversial - but sometimes its needed.Even in cases where the dangers are really not in dispute - such as passive smoking - it is hard to imagine that the elimination of indoor smoking would have been achieved without a legal ban.Like vaccination, unless enough people wear masks we wont see the benefit - and really, the purpose is to safeguard the most vulnerable whose own health perhaps might mean they cannot wear one.There is nothing to lose and, potentially, quite a lot to gain."},{"url":null,"title":"tourists-contract-covid-19-visiting-scotlands-rural-areas-should-isolate-are","story":"Yesterday, Scotlands hotels, pubs, restaurants and attractions were able to re-open indoors areas for the first time since lockdown ndash amid concerns many traders would not be able to restart their businesses during the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.In a bid to encourage Scots to help revive the devastated tourism industry, Visit Scotland has launched a television and radio campaign, calling on the public to make the most of whats on offer on their doorstep.Visit Scotland is urging Scots to travel close to home, rather than risk spreading the virus to remote parts of the country ndash highlighting the need for a sustainableto business for the tourism industry.:Scottish Government adviser warns SNPs lack of background in business could put jobs at riskWith some communities in isolated parts of Scotland fearful over a potential mass influx of visitors while the Covid- virus is still very much a threat to public health, tourism bosses are hoping to strike a balance between visitors supporting local businesses and being sensible with their actions.There have also been worries that tourists from England, where the prevalence of the virus is higher than in Scotland, could potentially spread the disease north of the border.

As the ferrys range reduced, the submarines officer of the watch altered course to avoid it.However, this turn was towards the ferry and reduced the time available for the submarine to keep out of the ferrys way, said the Marine Accident Investigatgion Branch report.With the sonar contact on a steady bearing, the submarines sonar team initiated a close quarters procedure - the commanding officer was also called to the control room.Based on the picture displayed by the submarines electronic tactical command system, the commanding officer intervened to cancel the close quarters move and ordered that the submarine remain at periscope depth rather than go deep to its safe depth.At about the same time, Stena Superfast VIIs lookout spotted a submarine periscope close on the port bow, and alerted the officer of the watch, who took immediate action to avoid collision.After taking avoiding action, the ferrys closest point of approach with the submarine was about  yards, which was unsafe, said the MAIB.However, the submarines commanding officer believed the passing distance to be about  yards, or four times the actual range.ldquoThis incident happened because the submarinersquos control room team overestimated the ferryrsquos range and underestimated its speed. This combination meant that the submarinersquos commanding officer and its officer of the watch made safety-critical decisions that might have appeared rational to them at the time but were actually based on inaccurate information, said the MAIB.ldquoTwo previous collisions between Royal Navy submarines and surface vessels show a similarity in that key decisions on board the submarines were made based on an insufficient appreciation of the location of surface ships in the vicinity.

The party commands the stage, its performance is incredible, but what lies beneath its feet is so unsteady that therersquos the expectation that something awful is going to happen at any moment. For the audience, this mix of quizzical admiration and a sense of mounting calamity mean itrsquos impossible to look away.However, as an audience, the Scottish public today finds itself at the interval ndash kept on tenterhooks with the lead character, the SNP, poised precisely midway between absolute victory and complete defeat.In a Western world where trust in politics is supposedly dead, the SNP defies the new norm. After a shaky start to handling Covid ndash which many commentators, myself included, rightly gave Nicola Sturgeon a hard time for ndash the Scottish Government broke out of effective lockstep with the shambolic UK administration. As Boris Johnsonrsquos government staggered from one insulting, dangerous absurdity to another, Sturgeon projected calm and honesty ndash at the very least she was able to convincingly present herself as a person voters can trust.If looked at from the perspective of history, therersquos certainly an academic argument to be had, weighing the dferences between how Edinburgh and London faired over the unfolding course of the pandemic. Some will say that in terms of hard policy therersquos been little substantial dference in the actions of the two governments, and that when it comes to the numbers of fatalities therersquos really not a lot statistically between the UK and Scotland. However, that perspective is increasingly more dficult to accept with each passing day as the dferences between the two countries and their approach to Covid become more starkly defined.The harsh truth, however, is that policy nuance and the fine detail of statistics donrsquot really matter that much in political terms. What matters is: are you a convincing and trusted leader  When it comes to Johnson the answer is a screaming No with Sturgeon itrsquos a resounding Yes. Put bluntly, Johnson brings fear, and Sturgeon reassurance. That alone, as political capital, is worth a vault of gold.The party is booming in the polls. If the SNP was traded on the stock market, yoursquod bet your pension on it. Support for independence is now the majority position. The party seems assured of more success at the next Holyrood elections. Surely, this is hegemony Even the looming big political hurdles and intergovernmental fights seem designed to play to the SNP, rather than damage it. Every threat to Scottish powers by Johnsonrsquos government, every dismissing of a right to hold a referendum, every stupid Brexiteer policy, every idiotic Westminster gaff, just confirms for an increasing number of Scottish voters that anything is better than whatrsquos going on in London.:Neil Mackay: I wanted a revolution but got a culture war insteadIt might be dferentthere was effective opposition in Holyrood, but the unionist parties couldnrsquot hold their own toes to the firetheir feet were cold, let alone hold the SNP to account.And talk of accounts brings us neatly to the rest of the balance sheet ndash the loss side of the ledger. Today, profits looks rosy for the SNP, but losses are coming, and soon.The forthcoming inquiry into the Alex Salmond debacle will ndash as even the animals in Edinburgh Zoo know ndash pour acid over the party. The currency of trust could quickly devalue. Faith could become revulsion. Scandal could supersede success.This corrosive circus comes as the Yes movement starts to split, reflecting the deep, dangerous fissures within the SNP. For a long time, therersquos been a growing gulf between fundamentalists and gradualists. Now a new independence party has appeared threatening list votes for Yes.The SNP is ided not just over how to achieve independence ndash and when ndash but on a flotilla of existential issues. The splits are town-country, populist-centrist, woke-traditionalist, green-business, left-right, and even Leave-Remain.Inevitably, for an umbrella party which needs to pull as many into its big tent as possible, minor fights are taking on the shape of destructive ision. That big tent has been up so long that punters inside are starting to turn on each other.Then therersquos the perception of growing anti-English sentiment. To be fair, the perception is mostly driven by fringe extremists many of whom have nothing to do with the broader Yes movement. But as with trust in the SNP over Covid, itrsquos perception that matters not facts. When the First Minister has to tell voters she doesnrsquot have ldquoan anti-English bone in her body, itrsquos clear matters have gone off message. Such a perception will repel newly acquired soft Yes supporters.:Neil Mackay: Scotland can lead the world when it comes to revolutionising the economy in the face of pandemic hellip herersquos howI could close on a good old fashioned Scottish football metaphor warning the SNP about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. But I began with a tightrope allusion, so indulge me in ending on one also. If the SNP can pull off its high-wire act and make it across the great gulf of political space to the other side of the tightrope, it will transform this country. It will take Scotland out of the UK and onto the worldrsquos stage as an independent nation. The party would go down in history. If it falls from the tightrope, though, itrsquos all over. Not only will the party implode, itrsquoll take the dreams of independence down with it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Visitor numbers will also be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: “At the forefront of our planning is the safety of our staff and visitors, whilst being able to reopen for the tourist season by gradually enabling safe access to our properties and facilities in line with Scottish Government guidance.“We’ve been working exceptionally hard to ensure our properties will be accessible and ready to welcome visitors, however, it’s important that we implement our resumption plans at the right time given the dferent requirements for each site.“This also includes looking at the ying local and regional requirements throughout the country and we have considered this when setting out our phased approach to welcoming visitors back and supporting Scotland’s tourism and economic recovery.”“We’re very much looking forward to welcoming visitors back to our sites. There will of course be some initial changes including managing visitor numbers at certain sites, as well as restricting access to specic locations, but we can assure visitors of a warm welcome as always.“We want to ask our visitors to help create a safe environment by behaving responsibly and following our guidance at properties, and we will be providing further information on our website for visitors to help them prepare for their visit.”HES has also published policy and guidance for the reopening of the properties in its care.The standards have been developed from a wide range of sector and industry advice, guidance and best practice, and set the benchmark for the safe reopening of sites and resumption of operational activities. The Operating Standards have been published to provide a resource for the wider heritage sector, and to support and assist other organisations with their own resumption planning.For further information on the re-opening please visit www.historicenvironment.scotTo view the COVID- Policy and minimum operating standards, visit: historicenvironment.scot covid--operating-standardscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Providing play parks do not get excessively busy and that the guidance is adhered to the level of risk should be low.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Officers have been working with PlayBoard NI to develop guidance for parents to enable facilities to reopen.Risk assessments have been carried out in accordance with Health  Safety Executive recommendations and research conducted by the UK Play Policy Forum into the impact of Covid- and children’s play.A range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of infection have been agreed and parents and children visiting play parks are asked to adhere to the following guidance:Closed Play ParksIf the play park you wish to use has not yet been officially reopened, please do no attempt to use or access the equipment, and we will get the play park opened as soon as possible.Secured equipmentIn some cases, damaged or broken pieces of play equipment may have been secured to prevent use. If an item has been secured in this manner, do not attempt to remove the temporary barriers or use the equipment.Social DistancingWhen visiting a play park make sure you follow current government guidance on social distancing, encourage and support your children to do the same and keep a safe distance from others not in your household social bubble.Busy Play ParksPlay parks may be busier than usual. If the park you visit is busy, consider coming back at a later time and let your child know in advance that this may be a possibility to avoid disappointment.Hand WashingWash your hands and your children’s hands before and after visiting the play park. Take hand sanitiser with you and ensure you and your child use it frequently whilst in the play park.Waste ManagementMake sure any disposable tissues, PPE equipment etc. are disposed of in the bins provided orone is not available take it home for disposal.Be SensibleIf you or anyone in your household are showing any Coronavirus symptoms, stay home and do not visit the play park.PlayBoard is inviting children aged between  and  to share their views about how Covid- has impacted on their play by taking part in a survey at https:www.surveymonkey r PBYourVoice "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.

Measures that were previously regulated by the European Union willto the UK at the end of the year when the transition period expires. Responsibilities in  policy areas - including animal welfare, public procurement rules and environmental regulations - will now go to one or more of the devolved administrations.The way the Government is handling theof powers from Brussels has already provoked a row with Nicola Sturgeon#s administration in Scotland after it was revealed that Whitehall will assume control of the state aid regime. The proposed changes - set out in a white paper being published today for consultation - will see Northern Ireland receive responsibility in  of the  areas, Scotland in  and Wales in . As this could lead to dferent regulatory regimes in the UK the Government has drawn up plans for the internal market to ensure seamless trade between the home nations. At the heart of the plans are the principles of mutual recognition - so regulations in one part of the UK are recognised in all the other nations - and non-discrimination, providing a level playing field for companies across the UK. Officials said that without these actions a Welsh lamb producer could end up unable to sell their meat in Scotland, or Scotch Whisky producers could lose access to supply from English barley farmers. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: This plan is vital to protect jobs and livelihoods across all four nations of the UK. Northern Ireland exports more to the rest of the UK than to all of the EU combined - nearly % of Northern Ireland#s total external trade is with Scotland, Wales and England.We will be enshrining in law the UK Government#s guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses will benefit from unfettered access to the whole UK market. And we will implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way which safeguards the effective working of the UK#s internal market.Making sure that seamless domestic trade can continue will support our economic recovery, provide certainty for businesses and create more opportunities for investment across Northern Ireland.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesCoronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Health Minister Swann to recommend mandatory face coverings in shops as no further deaths reportedSinn Fein calls for parties to condemn torrent of abuse aimed at O’Neill,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Recent events have exposed the fragility of the Executive by showing that it doesn#t take a scandal of the magnitude of RHI to blow devolution off course, he said.The repercussions of Covid- notwithstanding, meeting the commitments enshrined in New Decade, New Approach is the only way to restore trust in the devolution settlement and its ability to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland, who have been ill-served by stagnating public service provision for too long.All parties, the Executive, UK Government and Irish Government must work constructively to meet their commitments to forge a better future for Northern Ireland and to nurture healthy devolved governance. The UK Government must provide a realistic and long-term financial plan that recognises the challenges imposed by coronavirus.Mr Hoare stressed, however, that no amount of money can make the agreement work without the implementation of a more productive working culture at Stormont. To restore trust, the implementation of New Decade, New Approach will require regular monitoring and review, he added.The report also insisted that the stability of power-sharing rests on all parties# commitment to working within the spirit and the letter of the rules to maintain the devolved institutions. Meanwhile, it recommends that the Independent Fiscal Council, which is due to be established this summer to oversee the Executive#s revenue streams, should operate completely independently, as well as being adequately resourced. The committee is now urging all parties to focus on the needs of the people of Northern Ireland, who it says, have been ill-served by the Executive#s collapse.There should be no excuses for failure. We cannot sleepwalk into another Executive collapse, because the people of Northern Ireland deserve more, added Mr Hoare.

Trying to give comfort and help to folk in trouble. And again, it#s people from all backgrounds and faiths who come to me. Everybody#s problems are dferent but their needs for comfort, help, discernment and guidance are all equal.The MP adds that he has been given a practical day-to-day insight into the faith by his Catholic constituents.Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought Ian PaisleyWhat strikes me most is that they are unashamed and are never embarrassed about having a faith that promotes devotion and values family, children and le, he insists. These values are identical to my own beliefs. Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.Describing himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn, Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing.

That cannot be overvalued.He goes on to say that this is in sharp contrast to those who take the same stance in his own faith.As an evangelical Protestant I get tired by the embarrassment some of my faith have in declaring pro-le views, explains Mr Paisley, They say to me: #Yes, Ian, you might think that but you can no longer say it#, or #I agree with you, but we#ve just got to leave it with the Lord and realise we can#t do anything about it#.Frankly, that lack of faith appals me. Maybe it#s because I was brought up by a man of action that I just won#t let go. But I think it#s also the fact that my Roman Catholic constituents want a champion, even when the odds are stacked so decisively against us all on this issue.Stressing that he admires that loyalty and determined spirit, he also singles out anti-abortion campaigner, Bernie Smyth, who heads up Precious Le.She very happily signed my Westminster nomination on the basis of my pro-le credentials. I was moved by the fact that she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast, said the MP.Northern Ireland is a small place. That sort of public declaration doesn#t go unnoticed. The local parish priest also wrote to me before the last election. He told me he was openly urging anyone who would listen to him to support me because of these credentials. Then, in a practical way, the community put their money where their mouth is, sending me members to join my campaign team to put literature through doors and talk to constituents about the matter.That reminded me of why I admire my Roman Catholic friends.

We are confident that the device would have explodednot for the terrain it travelled over. We were unlucky this time but we only need to be lucky once.Mr Greene said the PSNI had investigated the movements of the officer#s car, a Jeep Cherokee, around Belfast on the days previous to the discovery and contacted gardai about the burning out of two cars nearby on June . One of the cars was a  southern-registered Skoda Octavia.Maps and photos were submitted in evidence by the prosecution.Counsel said that the trial will hear that the Octavia ended up in the yard of Mr O#Leary, a used car dealer, in May of , and that he is alleged to have altered the log book with an untruthful address.Outlining the case, Mr Greene said that Mr O#Leary will say that he sold the car to a stocky man, in his s for €.On August , , gardai arrested Mr O#Leary under the Offences against the State Act.Mr Greene read from the statement of the PSNI officer, who cannot be identied for safety reasons and is to be known as Officer One.Officer One said in his statement that he would usually check underneath his car but that because of builders at a neighbouring property he could not do it discreetly in the two mornings before the discovery.In his statement, Officer One detailed his movement in the Cherokee for May , May  and June  around east Belfast but said he did not note anything unusual.On Saturday, June , he drove to the golf course at .am, played golf and had a coffee. When ing to his car he saw the car next to his reverse, clearing his view of his own vehicle and allowing him to see the device underneath his car.With a clear view of the car, I saw what looked like a brown shoe box under my Jeep, in the shadow of the car and it appeared to be attached. It looked like a child#s woodwork project. It looked crude, basic and I wonderedit was a wind-up, Mr Greene read from Officer One#s statement.Approaching, Officer One realised it was a device, took photos but did not want to ring the PSNI for fear of setting it off by using his mobile. The PSNI were instead contacted via a landline at the pro-shop.A PSNI ordnance officer, who also cannot be identied, arrived at the scene and discovered  grams of TNT attached to an aluminium detonator inside a wooden box under the Jeep.The device was made safe after a partial explosion occurred, said Mr Greene, reading from Officer Two#s statement.Presiding judge Mr Justice Tony Hunt the defendant was remanded on continuing bail to appear today.The trial is expected to last one week.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesCoronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Health Minister Swann to recommend mandatory face coverings in shops as no further deaths reportedSinn Fein calls for parties to condemn torrent of abuse aimed at O’Neill,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The governing body for ladies’ football in Derry announced details of the tournament last week and Secretary Teresa McKenna said it was only right to remember a ‘great ambassador’. “During  lockdown, Derry lost a great ambassador for our beloved sport, a player who embodied everything which is to be celebrated about ladies’ football,” she said. “The Derry LGFA Executive felt it was only fitting that we would celebrate Seonaidh’s le and influence on the game of Ladies football over many years by dedicating this special event to her memory. googletag.cmd.push “Derry LGFA are delighted that Seonaidh’s family and club have given their blessing to our request and we look forward to welcoming all our clubs back out to competitive football with this very special event.” Seonaidh Mullan lost her battle with leukaemia in April  after a brave thirteen-month fight and the Carnabhal is an opportunity for the Derry LGFA community to pay tribute to her. A mainstay in the Ballerin team, Seonaidh had played for the team since it was formed in , right up until her illness took hold last year. She dedicated a lot of time to coaching the underage ranks and became a driving force behind the growth of the sport within the club. googletag.cmd.push Seonaidh’s husband, Stephen, said the family were proud to see the Carnabhal na Peile dedicated to her memory. “Seonaidh spent many happy years playing and coaching and, even during her illness, she attended matches and was interested in what was going on within her club and county,” he said. “We are really pleased and proud that the Carnabhal na Peile will be dedicated in Seonaidhs memory and on behalf of myself, our children, Oisiacuten and Uacutena, and all of our family, I would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for this very thoughtful gesture. Ballerin LGFC Secretary, Ursula McKillop, said the club were delighted the county board had chosen this way of celebrating Seonaidh’s le. “Alongside the many years of playing ladies football for Ballerin, Seonaidh was also our club chairperson for several years and spent many hours at the pitch coaching our underage teams,” she said. “It is very fitting that her memory is being recognised in this way. Ive no doubt she will be smiling down on us all as we take to the fields again in a few weeks’ time. “Our club would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for remembering Seonaidh in this special way and look forward to taking part in what will be a very special Carnabhal for Seonaidhs family, friends and wider GAA family.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The governing body for ladies’ football in Derry announced details of the tournament last week and Secretary Teresa McKenna said it was only right to remember a ‘great ambassador’. “During  lockdown, Derry lost a great ambassador for our beloved sport, a player who embodied everything which is to be celebrated about ladies’ football,” she said. “The Derry LGFA Executive felt it was only fitting that we would celebrate Seonaidh’s le and influence on the game of Ladies football over many years by dedicating this special event to her memory. googletag.cmd.push “Derry LGFA are delighted that Seonaidh’s family and club have given their blessing to our request and we look forward to welcoming all our clubs back out to competitive football with this very special event.” Seonaidh Mullan lost her battle with leukaemia in April  after a brave thirteen-month fight and the Carnabhal is an opportunity for the Derry LGFA community to pay tribute to her. A mainstay in the Ballerin team, Seonaidh had played for the team since it was formed in , right up until her illness took hold last year. She dedicated a lot of time to coaching the underage ranks and became a driving force behind the growth of the sport within the club. googletag.cmd.push Seonaidh’s husband, Stephen, said the family were proud to see the Carnabhal na Peile dedicated to her memory. “Seonaidh spent many happy years playing and coaching and, even during her illness, she attended matches and was interested in what was going on within her club and county,” he said. “We are really pleased and proud that the Carnabhal na Peile will be dedicated in Seonaidhs memory and on behalf of myself, our children, Oisiacuten and Uacutena, and all of our family, I would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for this very thoughtful gesture. Ballerin LGFC Secretary, Ursula McKillop, said the club were delighted the county board had chosen this way of celebrating Seonaidh’s le. “Alongside the many years of playing ladies football for Ballerin, Seonaidh was also our club chairperson for several years and spent many hours at the pitch coaching our underage teams,” she said. “It is very fitting that her memory is being recognised in this way. Ive no doubt she will be smiling down on us all as we take to the fields again in a few weeks’ time. “Our club would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for remembering Seonaidh in this special way and look forward to taking part in what will be a very special Carnabhal for Seonaidhs family, friends and wider GAA family.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Creggan man, who plays for Stoke City, was in the news again this week when he criticised the reaction to sectarian abuse he has faced during his career in England. The Republic of Ireland player spoke out after a number of prominent footballers recently suffered racist abuse. While condemning the abuse,McClean criticised the football authorities, his Irish team-mates and the media over their response to racist and sectarian abuse he has suffered over the years. He is regularly abused for his decision not to wear a poppy. googletag.cmd.push Does one kind of discrimination hold a higher bearing over another act of discrimination  McClean wrote this week on his Facebook page. He has received support fromSinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson who said more needs to be done to support the local footballer. “Its very sad that anyone would have to suffer such anti Irish racism in . I offer my support to James, Erin and their young family, she said. “Racism in any form must be challenged wherever it arises.There is no place for racism in soccer, sport or society. “I would appeal to those with influence within the sporting world to support James and his family. googletag.cmd.push “No person, in any walk of le, should have to suffer racial and sectarian abuse or intimidation. “It has been the case that James has been the subject of a witch-hunt and there has been avery vile campaign of hate against him across many s on social media.

There is a duty on us all to tackle racism and discrimination of any form in our communities and workplaces by challenging negative comments and behaviour.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Click here for survey  While all Council owned leisure centres currently remain closed to the public, preparations and arrangements are at an advanced stage to make the facilities safe for a phased and planned reopening. Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery. It is essential that they have the publicrsquos backing and support at this critical time, he said.ldquoIt is more important than ever that we support our local shops, cafes, bars and restaurants who collectively provide signicant employment, supporting many families.Cllr Andrews said local businesses and ious retail outlets ldquohave all gone the extra mile, working to implement guidelines and regulations designed to keep staff and customers safe at all times.He added: ldquoCrossgar is one particular part of the district where businesses have worked hard to ensure that people are safe, whether shopping or out for something to eat.ldquoThe village is home to a number of businesses, many of them family-owned, and it is important that we support them at this time, alongside other businesses across the district.

I would like them to get in touch.William said he has heard many reports about the disaster, including one relating to men from Portaferry who allegedly took a piano off the ship.The Georgetown Victory was a lsquoVictory Shiprsquo and was built in  at the Fortfield Shipyard at Bethlehem, Maryland, in the United States. She weighed in at , tons and was powered by two steam turbine enginesSays William: ldquoThe vessel was registered at Baltimore and when it left Fremantle for Glasgow with , Royal Navy men and marines due for demob. The crew mistook Strangford Lough for the River Clyde and the ship ran aground  yards off Killard Point, with her back breaking just forward of the bridge within a few hours of stranding.The Georgetown Victory had been converted from a cargo ship to a troopship able to transport up to , troops, with her cargo holds converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels. But he has no intention of doing so.His next project will be making a model of the SS Bereby, a British merchant steamer built in  and owned by the Elder-Dempster Line.In , the vessel, which was carrying military stores and general cargo, was wrecked at Ringvad Point, near Gunnrsquos Island, while en route from Liverpool for Takoradi.Anyone who can assist William with information about the Georgetown Victory is asked to contact him on    or pop into his shop in Quay Street..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call to be vigilant of seals  ","story":"VISITORS to Minerstown beach are being urged to tread carefully to protect seals and the arearsquos rich ecology.The appeal has been issued by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with officials particularly keen for boats and jet skis to stay away from key areas.Minerstown beach mdash popular with locals and visitors alike ndash is located within the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and, along with neighbouring Tyrella, is part of the Murlough Special Area of Conservation and area of special scientic interest.Noted for its honeycomb worm reefs and harbour seals, Minerstown was particularly busy over recent months with many people furloughed from work as part of sweeping coronavirus lockdown measures visiting the beach where harbour seals which are protected by law.Then animals use the rocky outcrops just offshore as so-called haul-out and pupping sites with the peak pupping season running from the end of June to mid-July.Pups wean from their mothers approximately four weeks after birth and, for this reason, council officials are asking all watercraft owners to stay away from the haul-out areas until the end of October.Council staff say that with seals very sensitive to disturbance, it is important for people to leave them alone.They say the area between the beachrsquos high and low tide marks is an important site for sand flats with boulders containing the honeycomb worm reef, a Northern Ireland priority marine feature.The worm lives in tubes constructed from small pieces of sand and shell fragment cemented together forming reefs between pebbles and boulders in the middle shore.Council officials have explained that these delicate reefs are under threat from beachgoers walking in the area and from vehicles driving on the beach.ldquoUnderstanding the impact that our actions can have and following simple advice will protect the health of the wildle at Minerstown beach and protect it for future generations, said officials.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said people were spoilt for choice when it came to local beaches and the waterways, with Minerstown one area which has seen an increase in use during the lockdown period.ldquoUnfortunately, an increase in the use of the beach and its surrounding waters can cause some problems for the local wildle, he said.ldquoThe council is asking beach goers to help it protect these beauty spots and the associated plants and animals by being mindful of how their actions can impact on the environment.Describing Minerstown as a ldquovery special place, she said it was important for local wildle.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoWhile we want our residents and visitors to enjoy the wonderful coast that our district has to offer, we also want to protect the habitats and species that make this place so special.ldquoPlease help us to protect this area by not taking vehicles onto the beach, stay away from the seal haul-out sites, always keep dogs under control and not allow them to chase birds.

I hope it is not obeying the tune of centralising services in Belfast. The local population deserves better.The former South Down MP said that as Northern Ireland was being reopened for business following a reduction in the number of Covid cases, ldquonormal services at the Downe hospital should resume.Lady Ritchie said anything which falls short of what was previously in the hospital would ldquorepresent a lack of faith and trust.She added: ldquoIt is important to remember that the real ing of the Downe Hospital with its suite of services and consultant physicians is directly linked to the AE provision.ldquoI have told both the health trustrsquos chief executive and health minister Robin Swann that anything that falls short of that requirement will be unacceptable and present our community with an intolerable position.Last week, health officials insisted that emergency services removed from the Downe as part of sweeping changes to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be reinstated. In addition, officials branded claims that the service will notand be replaced with a daily minor injuries service as ldquoinaccurate and misleading.The health trust says that it hopes to be in a position to confirm a date for theof AE services to the Downpatrick hospital by the end of July and that it remains totally committed to the Downe and its staff..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11592170.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

He would then stay somewhere .ldquoThis happened on so many occasions that it is not possible for me to remember them all in detail. However, I would describe it as a recurring cycle that Ms Heard would abuse Mr Depp, who would then remove himself from the situation.Mr Bett also claimed: ldquoMs Heard often behaved in this way when she had been drinking. I learnt quickly to recognise the signs, so that we were able to leave the situation before it escalated further.In his statement, Mr Bett gave his account of an incident on May  , in which Mr Depp is alleged to have thrown a phone at Ms Heard and smashed objects at their LA penthouse, which he denies.Mr Bett said he and another security guard, Jerry Judge, were waiting outside and entered the apartment when they heard shouts from Ms Heard.His statement said: ldquoWhen we entered, we saw Mr Depp standing approximately  feet away from Ms Heard, who was standing by the couch.ldquoAs soon as Ms Heard noticed that we had entered the room, she looked very surprised her demeanour then changed and she pointed at Mr Depp and screamed to us words to the effect of lsquoIf he hits me one more time, I am calling the policersquo.Mr Bett went on to say: ldquoI have quite good eyesight. I was able to see that Ms Heard was wearing little or no make-up, her skin was quite pale and she had no red marks or evidence of any bruises or abrasions to her face or body.ldquoI could see Mr Depp was visibly upset at having been accused of hitting Ms Heard. However, he never came closer than  feet to her during the time I was able to observe them.ldquoI did not notice any smashed glass or broken bottles in the apartment at the time.Mr Bett claimed he, Mr Depp and Mr Judge agreed that the actor should leave the building ldquodue to the fact that the situation had escalated and Ms Heard was hysterically shouting at Mr Depp and making allegations about his behaviour..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Depp security chief claims Heard was  uverbally and physically abusive u to actor article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today’s events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day.“I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe.“I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with us to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety.”Roger Gardiner, Orange grand secretary for Co Armagh, welcomed the PSNI acknowledgement of the efforts made to keep within the guidelines.“We did not expect anything dferent,” he said. “The only real events held by the Orange on Monday were really just a few members laying wreaths at war memorials across the Province. In Co Armagh we held a small outdoor event with less than  members who were all socially distanced.”The Co Armagh event took place at the Museum of Orange Heritage, Sloan’s House, Loughgall, on Monday afternoon.TUV leader Jim Allister also praised the handling of the Twelfth.“Many eyes were on the unionist community on Monday, ready to grasp any real or perceived breach of the regulations,” he said.“The reality is that they were left scrabbling around desperate to find something to complain about as the vast, vast majority heeded the Orange advice to have a Twelfth at home and celebrate responsibly.“The institution has provided tremendous leadership on this and I am delighted that the unionist community has responded so well. “Cancelling what is unquestionably one of the largest cultural events in Europe and foregoing generations of tradition was a big sacrice which deserves much wider recognition than it has received to date and stands in stark contrast to the actions of others in recent days. “While Stormont can no longer even give press conferences about the pandemic because the joint head of government blatantly broke her own guidance to honour a terrorist, there is no need for any Orange leaders to go into hiding. Orangeism rose to the challenge in .”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
