It restores the levels of female hormones, bringing relief to hundreds of thousands of women each year.Doctors warn some types of HRT can raise the risk of breast cancer, but insists that the benefits outweigh the risks.The Telegraph claimed the aim of making HRT available to women over the counter was to improve access.  Reacting to the news, Haitham Hamoda, chair of the British Menopause Society, said: \u0027Improving access to HRT is a good thing.\u0027But it is really important that women can access all the help and advice they need.\u0027It\u0027s great there is so much conversation about menopause now, and people are far more open about it. \u0027But we don\u0027t want this to come down to a question of self-diagnosis – it\u0027s really important that those thinking about starting HRT get the right information.\u0027Clare Murphy, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: \u0027Improving access to HRT as well as abortion and contraception is really important for women, so this is extremely welcome news.\u0027 The move comes after a lengthy campaign to improve access to HRT and reduce the cost for those who receive it on prescription.And it follows on the heels of the contraceptive pill being made available over the counter for the first time since it was licensed 60 years ago.The MHRA approved two brands of the contraceptive, called Lovima and Hana, to be made available without written authorisation.MPs said at the time that the change would reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancies and abortions, and relieve pressure on GPs. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u0027We understand that, for some women, menopause symptoms can have a significant impact on their quality of life and we are committed to improving the care and support they receive.\u0027The spokesman added that the menopause and improving access to HRT would be a \u0027priority\u0027 under the new Women\u0027s Health Strategy, which is being developed.Hormone replacement therapy to be sold over the counter for first time"},{"url":null,"title":"Biden offers Putin access NATO bases","story":"Share this articleShare this articleSubscribe to read | Financial TimesUS has identified Russian elites who will be sanctioned if Putin invades Ukraine - CNNPoliticsHungary’s leader, visiting Moscow, calls Russian demands reasonable and says sanctions are pointless.U.S. Dangles Offer to Russia on Missile Checks at Key NATO Bases"},{"url":null,"title":"1 5BN blackhole forces Sadiq Khan slam BRAKES green revolution","story":"Share this article\u0027It is so important that the government urgently comes forward with the long-term funding TfL desperately needs so we can keep services running and deliver much-needed improvements to our transport infrastructure,\u0027 he warned earlier this month.The Labour party mayor, re-elected last year for a second term, is reluctantly proposing to raise the compulsory housing tax in the next budget, which he has said would \u0027unfairly punish Londoners for the way the pandemic has hit our transport network\u0027.He wants the government to inject around £1.7billion to fund TfL until April 2023. However, the Department for Transport has said Mr Khan is responsible for getting the system \u0027back onto a sustainable financial footing in a way that is fair to taxpayers, rather than continuing to push for bailouts\u0027.\u0027We will continue to discuss further funding requirements with TfL and the Mayor,\u0027 a spokesman said this week. The standoff reflects the inevitable rivalry between Mr Khan, touted as a potential future Labour leader, and the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, himself a former London mayor. Both have accused each other of mismanaging the capital\u0027s extensive transport system. TfL notes the pandemic has \u0027devastated\u0027 its accounts, with fares revenue falling by 95 per cent at the height of the first coronavirus wave in 2020.It has been forced to dip into its cash reserves to keep services running while going cap in hand to the government for support.Mr Johnson\u0027s administration has already pledged £4billion in subsidies to keep the system running, as well as £600 million in loans.The financial crisis has also affected the capital\u0027s new east-west Crossrail route, formally known as the Elizabeth Line, with the stretched budget adding to delays and costs.Other global cities have faced similar struggles, including Ile-de-France Mobilites (IDFM) in the Paris area, which needed government support in its 2020 and 2021 budgets.Meanwhile in the United States, \u0027strong\u0027 financial support packages passed by Congress and the White House helped replace ticket revenues lost from lockdowns, according to Paul Skoutelas, head of the American Public Transportation Association, an industry organisation. But TfL, which gets nearly two-thirds of its operating income from fares - a much higher proportion compared to New York or Paris, where it is more like 40 per cent - has been left especially exposed.\u0027Pre-Covid, TfL was largely self-sustained,\u0027 explained Taku Fujiyama, who leads University College London\u0027s railway research group, noting it received no major central government grants.\u0027Some cost-cutting measures are on the table now,\u0027 he said, adding dramatic line closures were unlikely but minor service changes \u0027might happen\u0027.\u0027TfL needs to play a delicate game,\u0027 Mr Fujiyama told AFP. \u0027The central government would not give blank cheques, and the TfL would need to demonstrate their effort, whilst the mayor knows that dramatic service reduction would be politically costly.\u0027With the threat from the Omicron variant now receding, passengers are returning to the system, aiding revenues but still leaving a large gap to plug.Weekday passenger numbers were at 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels on the Tube and 70 per cent on buses in mid-January, with TfL expecting them both to reach 80 per cent this year.The organisation has said it is exploring a number of ways to boost income, including through efficiency gains, commercial property projects and consultancy services.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d51e60e521c968cf1463b119d9197cc2cef8923f/0_51_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=09d3a164d13259419bbe279b3df0294b","title":"oil prices climb seven year highs opec meeting markets await eurozone inflation","story":"It said in a brief statement that it would reveal the new energy price cap at 11am.

Experts believe that this could rise to around £1,900 from April 1 when the new price cap comes into force. Calls have intensified in recent weeks for the government to step in to help struggling households. Ofgem will on Thursday announce what is expected to be the steepest ever increase in home energy bills, amid growing speculation that the Treasury is considering a multi-billion pound move to protect households from the full brunt of the hike. The unexpected, eleventh hour decision comes as new government measures to protect households from rocketing energy prices has emerged.  understands the Treasury is looking at the “broad-brush financial support” as well as extra payments for vulnerable customers who will be hardest hit by the energy price cap increase due to be announced on Monday. The multibillion-pound plan to “top slice” energy bills would allow suppliers to borrow government money and soften the financial impact on their customers by paying the loans back through higher tariffs over the coming years, according to senior industry sources.More people are seeking one-to-one support from Citizens Advice than at any point during the pandemic. The charity warns that crisis support - including referrals to food banks and advice on emergency one-off grants - is at the highest level on record. Similarly, advice on managing energy debts has reached unprecedented heights.  Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: But there are four dangers in going down this route, Jessop said. Helen Morrissey, senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The prime minister and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, have agreed to a “rebate and clawback” scheme, in which taxpayers will underwrite loans to energy firms, the paper said.

This is more than twice the European Central Bank’s target, but the bank –– which holds a policy meeting tomorrow -- has so far shrugged off rising inflation, saying that it is temporary.Markets have priced in a series of rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England this year. The Bank meets tomorrow, as does the European Central Bank, which has so far brushed off talk of rate increases. Fed officials have played down the chance of a half-point rate rise in March. According to Deutsche Bank research, global stock markets in January had their worst month since March 2020, at the time of the Covid-19 outbreak and first lockdowns.  The pound has hit a 1 12 week high before the Bank of England meeting where policymakers are widely expected to raise borrowing costs again, following December’s surprise rate hike.

The Financial Times reported that Cevian, Europe’s largest activist fund, wanted Vodafone to be more aggressive in driving consolidation in markets such as Spain, Italy and the UK. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said:  Oil prices have climbed towards the seven-year highs reached last week, after a drawdown on US crude stocks suggested strong demand and amid a lack of supply, but investors remained cautious ahead of a meeting by the Opec oil cartel and its allies (known as Opec+) later today.  US crude stocks fell by 1.6m barrels in the week to 28 January, more than expected, Reuters reported, citing market sources who had seen American Petroleum Institute figures. Brent crude is up 20 cents at $89.36 a barrel while US light crude has gained 21 cents to $88.41 a barrel. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia are expected to stick to the group’s policy of moderate boosts to output at today’s meeting, i.e. pumping 40,000 more barrels a day from March. Tensions are rising between Russia, the world’s second-biggest oil producer, and the West over Ukraine, stoking fears that energy supplies to Europe could be disrupted.

File photograph: Nick BradshawAn estimated 80 per cent of those eligible for a booster vaccine have received the jab, public health officials have said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) said that in “broad terms”, it is satisfied with the level of protection in place against Covid-19 in the State.Speaking at a meeting of the Oireachtas Health Committee on Wednesday, Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer, said demand for booster vaccines has decreased since the record demand experienced over the Christmas and New Year period.“There are a variety of reasons for that. We think that if you take the proportion of people who have been boosted and then the proportion of people who can’t be boosted because they’ve been recently infected… we estimate that about 80 per cent of all those eligible to be boosted have been boosted,” he said.There is currently no recommendation for booster vaccines for those in the 12 to 15 year old cohort, he said, adding that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) is currently examining the issue.“There’s a lot to weigh up there so we’ll wait to hear back from them. I think we would expect something certainly in the next two to three weeks, I think we’d expect a recommendation from them either way on this.”On the remaining restrictions in schools, Dr Glynn said public health officials are reviewing evidence about mask-wearing for primary schools and will make a recommendation on it later this month.Asked about the difference between pubs and schools, Dr Glynn said a “key part” of the rationale is to give all children in primary schools an opportunity to be vaccinated. In pubs, all adults have been given this opportunity, he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"a 37 acre central bank site near m50 set to be designated for social housing","story":"The currency centre in Sandyford retains the facility to mint euro coin at the siteA large tract of Central Bank lands near the M50 motorway in south Dublin is set to be designated for social and affordable housing as the bank reviews the future of its high-security currency centre in Sandyford.The 37-acre site, home of the national mint for decades, is in the sights of the Land Development Agency (LDA) as it prepares to submit a statutory list to the Government of public lands suitable for housing. The agency, which was set up to amass and develop State property for housing, aims to build 8,000 new dwellings around the State over the next five years. Members of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have voted to provide residential and open space zoning on the Central Bank site, rejecting the proposal of planners in the council’s draft development plan to seek zoning for economic use. The council aims to adopt the 2022-2028 development plan next month. “These lands should provide local affordable homes for families in the Dundrum, Stillorgan, Sandyford areas,” said Fine Gael councillor Barry Saul. “People who grew up in the locality should be afforded the ability to purchase a new affordable home in their locality.”The Central Bank is listed as a relevant public body with relevant public land in the law underpinning the LDA. The bank is on a list of bodies whose lands must be built out with 100 per cent social and affordable housing if they come under LDA control, thereby limiting the price at which such property would transfer to the agency. This has led to some disquiet behind the scenes. Certain figures in the Central Bank have argued privately that the institution should not be compelled to sell land for less than the market rate, saying such a move would infringe its independence of the Government. The bank has ruled out a move in the short-term, saying in a statement that the timeframe would be “at least five to seven years” if change is recommended. “We continue to conduct a strategic review into the future of the currency centre in Sandyford,” it said. “If that strategic review recommends moving to another location, the Central Bank of Ireland will have due regard to the contents of the Land Development Agency Act and any planning regulations that are in place.”The bank has been in Sandyford for more than 40 years. The currency centre is a storage and distribution facility for bulk cash services, necessitating permanent Defence Forces protection and extensive surveillance. It stopped printing banknotes there in 2019 as euro notes are imported, but retains the facility to mint euro coin at the site.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron subvariant ba 2 has potential to replace original globally says who","story":"There appears to be no difference in disease severity in new BA.2 subvariant.

Other parties have called the move a stunt. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPANorthern Ireland’s Minister of Agriculture has warned he will decide “shortly” whether to take unilateral action to halt post-Brexit checks at the North’s ports.Edwin Poots told BBC Radio Ulster he had sought legal advice after he attempted to bring a paper to the Northern Executive seeking approval for the checks on agri-food products.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Assembly member said he expected to receive the advice of senior counsel “imminently” and would make a decision after he considers the advice.“If the advice leads me to a conclusion that the staff need to have the legal basis to operate there, which stems from having Executive approval, then I’ll have to act on that,” he said.He also warned that the DUP could take action soon to withdraw its ministers from Stormont over the lack of progress on the Northern Ireland protocol.“What we have currently is entirely unacceptable and if people think that is something that we’re just going to allow to grind on and on and on then that’s not going to happen,” he said.“The European Union negotiators have been dragging their feet and there’s a consequence for that and that consequence is coming down the line, and it’s coming down the line very, very fast.“This situation cannot go on much longer. If we’re not into days, then it’s weeks, but my suspicion is it’s more like days.”The DUP and other unionist parties are opposed to the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that avoided a hard Border on the island of Ireland by creating a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea.They claim it is creating economic hardship and has undermined the North’s constitutional position as an integral part of the UK by placing a barrier between it and Britain.Mr Poots’s attempt to seek a vote on the checks last week was part of his party’s broader campaign against the protocol.The DUP has repeatedly threatened to withdraw its ministers from the Stormont Executive – potentially leading to the collapse of the power-sharing institutions – if sufficient changes are not made to the protocol.He claims that recent court rulings mean the Executive must give its approval for the checks to continue.The move was criticised as a stunt by other parties, who maintain the Executive has already agreed his department is responsible for carrying out the checks and he does not have the authority to halt them as they are a requirement of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international agreement.Had his paper been discussed at the Executive, under Stormont rules the DUP could have used its veto to block approval for the checks.However, Sinn Féin used its veto to prevent it making it on to the agenda.Political careerMeanwhile, Mr Poots said on Wednesday his political demise has “not just happened quite yet” after he failed to secure the nomination to stand as his party’s candidate in South Down in the Assembly elections, which are due in May.The decision to select Diane Forsythe has to be ratified by the party’s Executive.Mr Poots is one of two DUP MLAs in Lagan Valley – the other is the First Minister Paul Givan – while the party leader Jeffrey Donaldson – currently the constituency’s MP – is to seek election to the Assembly there in May.“Everything I have done I have been doing in the interests of the party,” he said.

Of those, around 150,000 are prescribed HRT in the form of tablets, gels, creams or patches.The  can disclose that watchdogs are set to propose a reclassification of the medication so women are able to access it in a pharmacy without a prescription.It follows changes last summer that saw the contraceptive pill sold over the counter following a relaxation of rules by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.It also comes after a long campaign to improve access to HRT and reduce the cost for women who receive it on prescription.In October, ministers announced that costs would be cut by up to £200 a year after the Government backed a campaign championed by celebrities including Penny Lancaster and Davina McCall. Under that change, costs of up to £19 per month can be replaced by one annual prescription for the same cost.The latest proposal aims to improve convenience so that women are able to access HRT more easily, without needing a GP appointment. But it follows years of debate over the risks and benefits of HRT, which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.Haitham Hamoda, the chairman of the British Menopause Society, said: Improving access to HRT is a good thing, but it is really important that women can access all the help and advice they need.It\u0027s great that there is so much conversation about menopause now, and people are far more open about it. But we don\u0027t want this to come down to a question of self-diagnosis – it\u0027s really important that those thinking about starting HRT get the right information.Some pharmacists already employ trained prescribers who are able to issue medicines on prescription. The latest changes may still require a consultation with a pharmacist, as is the case when the contraceptive pill is purchased over the counter.The number of women taking HRT therapy fell dramatically after a major 2002 study linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. Since then, evidence has been conflicting.In 2015, NHS watchdogs said far more help should be offered to those suffering debilitating night sweats and hot flushes. Experts from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence suggested at least twice as many women could benefit from HRT as were actually on it, saying far too many had been left in unbearable misery.In 2019, a Lancet review said the therapy raised the risks of breast cancer by one third. It found that while the risk of breast cancer was 6.3 per cent for women aged between 50 and 69 who have not taken HRT, it rises to 8.3 per cent for those on the most common combination of HRT.The medication works by boosting levels of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which are lower among women during the menopausal period.  Last year, a study found that taking hormone replacement therapy during the menopause does not increase the risk of dementia. However, staying on HRT long term was linked to a slight increase in the risk of Alzheimer\u0027s.The changes will mean pharmaceutical manufacturers can apply for reclassification of their products, allowing over-the-counter sale under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist.  They come as ministers prepare to extend rules that allow abortion pills to be taken at home. Since the start of the Covid pandemic, home abortions have been allowed in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy in legislation due to expire at the end of next month. But the  understands that period will now be extended in a move likely to anger anti-abortion groups and some MPs.Clare Murphy, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: Improving access to HRT as well as abortion and contraception is really important for women, so this is extremely welcome news.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: We understand that, for some women, menopause symptoms can have a significant impact on their quality of life, and we are committed to improving the care and support they receive.That\u0027s why we\u0027re developing the first ever government-led Women\u0027s Health Strategy, informed by women\u0027s lived experience. Menopause, including improving access to Hormone Replacement Therapy, will be a priority under the strategy.More from NewsWatch PMQs live: Speculation mounts another Tory will join Tobias Ellwood and call for Boris Johnson to quitUkraine crisis latest: US offers Russia chance to inspect for Tomahawk missiles in Eastern EuropeHow the ‘Partygate’ scandal has sent Boris Johnson’s approval rating plummeting\u0026#39Indiana Jones of the art world\u0026#39 returns statue to France 50 years after heistDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mi6 chiefs wordle outburst sparks five letter response","story":"The head of MI6 has revealed his annoyance at puzzle game Wordle spoilers being revealed as his outburst sparked a playful spat between C and GCHQ.Richard Moore, the chief of MI6, tweeted Wednesday that he was “thinking” of unfollowing accounts on the social media site that revealed the day’s answer in the online game.His comment prompted the official Twitter account of GCHQ to tweet a mocked-up graphic of the game with the word ‘sorry’ on it in response.The playful exchange between the head of the UK’s foreign intelligence agency and its digital spy body comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the Ukraine over mounting concerns of a possible Russian invasion.In the midst of the crisis, the head of MI6 indicated this morning that he is enjoying playing the hit game, which sees people given six attempts to guess a five letter word.Players are then given clues about which letters they got right and if they were in the right place to help them solve the puzzle.The game, which only releases one new word a day, has become an internet sensation with celebrities such as TV author and presenter Richard Osman and BBC anchor Dan Walker among its fans.Expressing his frustration at those who reveal the answer before people are able to solve it themselves, Mr Moore tweeted: “Thinking of unfollowing those who post their #Wordle results…”He then posted the GCHQ response to his feed.The exchange prompted other users on Twitter to offer Mr Moore advice on how to avoid seeing the Wordle answer online, such as removing tweets with it from his feed.Another user added: “I would hope you would know their results before they post them - kind of the point of your role.”Meanwhile, the agency will be busy monitoring the build-up and movements of around 100,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.Mr Johnson flew out to Kyiv yesterday in show of support to Ukrainian president  Volodymyr Zelensky, as the UK supplies the Eastern European nation with weapons ahead of any escalation in the conflict.More from NewsWatch PMQs live: Speculation mounts another Tory will join Tobias Ellwood and call for Boris Johnson to quitUkraine crisis latest: US offers Russia chance to inspect for Tomahawk missiles in Eastern EuropeHow the ‘Partygate’ scandal has sent Boris Johnson’s approval rating plummeting\u0026#39Indiana Jones of the art world\u0026#39 returns statue to France 50 years after heistDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMajority of public think Boris Johnson should resign over alleged Downing Street partiesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle won world","story":"Some people are calling it the biggest sellout since Nick Clegg took the Liberal Democrats into coalition with the Conservatives 12 years ago. Wordle, the online word puzzle turned sleeper viral hit, has been bought by the New York Times for a seven-figure sum, just weeks after its creator Josh Wardle said: “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun. It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs.”It’s hard to blame Wardle, a British software engineer from near Abergavenny but based in Brooklyn, or wish him anything other than good luck. Knowing his partner loved word games, Wardle created the guessing game for her, naming it Wordle as a play on his own surname. But once it caught on in his family’s WhatsApp group he released it to the rest of the world in October last year and its popularity snowballed beyond his wildest dreams. How many of us, having – as he did – created the game as a fun challenge for his partner, would turn down more than a million bucks? The gratitude of strangers doesn’t pay the bills. Besides, the experience of going from unknown to internet stardom must be incredibly discombobulating. “I’d be lying if I said this hasn’t been a little overwhelming,” he said.But by the same token it’s difficult to escape the feeling that something pure and innocent has been broken. Since it first appeared last October, Wordle has been free from advertising and subscription alike, uncluttered by adverts or notifications. Wardle himself was endearingly honest about his lack of greed. “I don’t have to charge people money for this and ideally would like to keep it that way,” he said last month. “The business side of things is not super interesting to me at all, and I can’t imagine anyone paying… I’m just kind of suspicious of apps and games that want your endless attention. I worked in Silicon Valley. I know why they do that. I kind of deliberately did what you’re not meant to do if growth is your goal. I think people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”Jonathan Knight, general manager of the New York Times’ games ision, says Wordle “has done what so few games have done: it has captured our collective imagination.” He’s right about that. I’m one of the millions – at least two million and counting, up from 90 players in November and 300,000 at the beginning of January – who play it every day, sometimes clicking on the homepage at exactly midnight when a new puzzle goes live.The rules are simple: you have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. If you guess the right letter in the right place that letter turns green, the right letter in the wrong place turns yellow, and a wrong letter stays grey. I have good-natured competitions going on with my wife and friends, though the essential benevolence (at least from my end) is regularly tested by the fact that it takes me noticeably more attempts than it does them. I maintain that this is because I’m a writer and therefore think of many more different words than they do. Their replies provide me with yet more possible answers for future puzzles: if not for Wordle itself, then for its smutty parody Lewdle.There are many reasons for the game’s success. It’s an intellectual exercise, and we like to feel clever. It’s hard, but not too hard: the answer is always an obvious one in retrospect (even if British players were upset the other day when the chosen word was FAVOR, spelt the American way). “I feel smart when I get a Wordle, even though I made the game,” Wardle says. “It’s about the journey, especially on days where I’m really stumped and have to think about it. It’s sufficiently hard to enable me to hit a sense of accomplishment that feels good.” We can try to work out which words are best to start with (at least two vowels and probably an ‘S’ too). We have to think not just of inidual letters but of combinations too: ‘r’ is often a good second letter after a hard consonant such as ‘p’ or ‘t’.Social media and messaging services have made results easy to share, and the grid Wardle has designed for this is perfect: it shows your results without giving away the answers. In the progress from one colourful line to the next is a litany of decisions, guesses, failures and triumphs. The mixture of isolation and connectivity which these grids represent is a perfect reflection of pandemic times. “I get emails from people who say things like ‘Hey, we can’t see our parents due to Covid at the moment but we share our Wordle results each day’,” Wardle says. “During this weird time it’s a way for people to connect in a low-effort, low-friction way.”“The fact that we are all trying to solve the same puzzle brings us together,” says psychologist Lee Chambers. “There’s both a sense of community in terms of ‘How difficult did people find it this time?’ and a competitive angle in terms of ‘How well did I stack up in finding this word compared to everyone else?’’’Most of all, Wordle’s success has been down to the fact that there’s only one a day. We live in an age not just of more, more, more but also of now, now, now: everything we want is available instantly in its entirety. TV shows, films, books, games: they’re all just a click away. But Wordle is different. There’s no cache of old games, no easy store of upcoming ones (yes, computer scientists have broken the source code and you can find websites where all future answers are listed, but where’s the fun in that?) There’s just today’s game, nothing else. It harks back to the days of vinyl records and analogue TV, of 90-minute TDK cassettes and the Radio 1 charts on Sunday afternoon: simpler times in a less atomised society. “The internet is in a really bad place at the moment, but this is great because it’s not doing all those nasty things,” says Adam Procter, who leads the computer game design course at Southampton University.Wordle is not, it has to be said, especially original: there are shades both of the TV show Lingo and the 1970s peg-and-board game Mastermind, which had on the lid a bearded man and a woman in white staring at the camera with disturbing intensity. But very few games can claim to have a single inventor: number puzzles, for example, began in French newspapers in the late 19th century, whereas Sudoku’s popularity in the West today is a joint effort between American puzzle constructor Howard Garns (whose grids ran in magazines from 1979) and Hong Kong judge Wayne Gould, who developed a computer programme capable of rapidly producing multiple unique puzzles.Wordle’s success also points to a wider social trend: we are obsessed with puzzles. No pub is complete without a quiz, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? has entered the national psyche, Mastermind is still going 50 years after its first broadcast and University Challenge now gets former alumni back for Christmas spin-offs to go alongside the main franchise. GCHQ advertises for codebreakers and puzzle solvers. Crime fiction, which is all about using clues to solve mysteries, remains hugely popular both in bookstores and on TV: before Richard Osman’s multi-million-selling Thursday Murder Club series came Dan Brown, whose Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code were essentially coded treasure hunts wrapped up in thriller clothes. Newspapers carry entire supplements of Sudoku grids, crosswords and other puzzles. Interestingly, the modern crossword also dates from troubled times, beginning in American newspapers in 1913, just before World War I. Crosswords became ever more popular during the Great Depression as a distraction from people’s troubles, and only one newspaper held out against including one until after Pearl Harbor – the same one that has just bought Wordle.The New York Times has pledged that Wordle will “be free to play for new and existing players, and no changes will be made to its gameplay,” at least for the time being. And if the game remains essentially the same, the logical and intellectual challenges it poses should also be undimmed. But those are only part of what makes, or perhaps made, Wordle so special. It was something we felt belonged to us all, unmonetised and unexploited, and now it belongs to a £5bn corporation. If ever there was a moral for our times – or perhaps a MORAL for our TIMES, get it in six tries or fewer – it is this.More from NewsWatch PMQs live: Speculation mounts another Tory will join Tobias Ellwood and call for Boris Johnson to quitUkraine crisis latest: US offers Russia chance to inspect for Tomahawk missiles in Eastern EuropeHow the ‘Partygate’ scandal has sent Boris Johnson’s approval rating plummeting\u0026#39Indiana Jones of the art world\u0026#39 returns statue to France 50 years after heistDuchess of Cambridge ready to tackle her next role ... as patron of England rugby boardsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits cant afford lose 2000","story":"Brits cant afford to lose £, more every year without help from governmentThe Cabinet Ministers increasing taxes on incomes through National Insurance or failing to cool rising prices – particularly soaring fuel bills – are a major part of the problemBoris Johnson and the Conservative Party only pretend they support people Image: UK PARLIAMENT AFP via Getty ImagopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb |comments Slashing the living standards of families who are already feeling the squeeze could trigger a ferocious backlash against the Conservatives and Boris Johnson.Households simply cannot lose nearly £, in spending power without feeling intense pain or plunging into debt. The Cabinet Ministers increasing taxes on incomes through National Insurance or failing to cool rising prices – particularly soaring fuel bills – are a major part of the problem. One of the fundamental iding lines in politics is whose side a party is on. Opinion polls suggest voters are recognising the Conservatives are tightening family budgets callously whereas Labour is proposing fully-costed policies to put extra money into pay packets and slow price hikes. Working people deserve better from a government and political party which only pretends it is on their side, levelling down their living standards while ly claiming to want to level up those it disadvantaged for years.  What a waste We are learning how the Conservatives cannot be trusted with taxpayers’ money as they admitted to £.billion losses on Covid PPE contracts worth £.bn. Every piece of unusable, unsuitable and overpriced item is charged to the British public and the colossal waste of our money by the Government is indefensible. Add other unacceptable bills such as the £.bn in loans and financial support written off as Covid fraud and the total tops £bn before other areas are counted – enough to cancel a year’s National Insurance rises or suspend BBC licence fees for nearly four years. Joker hurts UK Russian mockery of Boris Johnson’s visit to Ukraine would normally be dismissed as Putin propaganda.

He said Ms Truss was little known and had said a lot of stuff that will not be popular with members  when they hear it. If she gets to the last , the combination of her support for Remain and her record will be big problems for her. Her chances are probably being overrated, he said.He said he thought Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove probably will run again, while on Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, he said: He has never been in Cabinet and it is hard to imagine Tory MPs promoting someone straight to the top job who has not been in Cabinet.He said: RS is obviously the front runner cos heaposs way ahead in the polls and unlike Truss Hunt TT was pro-Brexit. His team conceived and executed furlough in very tough circumstances, and which was one of most popular things a politician has done in a very long time. That will be a big strength when the contest comes. He went on to tell Tory MPs there was no excuse for self-delusions about Boris Johnson. At this point the blame lies mostly with the Tory MPs, he wrote. Heaposs obviously totally unfit for the job and every day heaposs left their moral authority drops another notch.

Treasury insiders denied that Mr Johnson had set a precedent that other ministers should follow.  They said Mr Sunak had felt it was important to be visible and supportive of the Government on the day Sue Gray published an update of her report. The Chancellor later attended a crowded meeting of the Toriesapos backbench  committee in a show of solidarity with his beleaguered boss. And he led Treasury questions in the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday.  Mr Sunak, who was one of the only ministers wearing a facemask on the frontbench, tested negative before the Commons statement.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, sitting on Ms Patelaposs other side, later tested positive for Covid and was forced to miss her trip to the Ukraine with the PM.

The advice adds that people should work from homeyou are able to and wear a face-covering in crowded places. A spokesman for Mr Sunak said: The Chancellor has followed the legal requirements to the letter. “He has taken daily lateral flow tests and has limited his social contact where possible, whilst also ensuring that he is able to continue to conduct important Government and Parliamentary business as the public would expect.  Just last month, No  announced Mr Johnson was unlikely to be seen in public for a week after a member of his immediate family, later revealed to be baby Romy, tested positive for Covid. The PMaposs official spokesman said he would heed official guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact, he told reporters. He’ll be working from No , doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No  and indeed inside No  as well, having limited contact with others in the building, and conducting meetings online.” However, Mr Johnson faced accusations he was hiding behind the illness, as it came while he faced intense scrutiny over his attendance at a BYOB garden party in No  during lockdown. The PM cancelled a visit to a vaccination centre in Lancashire, where he would have faced tough media questions, while a Downing Street press conference was also axed.

The evidence of his alleged crimes are being kept hidden from him for fear of interference.And with war brewing on Europeaposs eastern flank, the PM told the enemy he didnapost have time to ring, because he had too much arse-covering to do.The Conservative Party is like an abused we with no other home to go to, and in two minds, not about whether this is acceptable, but whether itaposs survivable. And like every victim, it has yet to realisethataposs the question, then itaposs time to go.  Yesterday, a report he resisted ordering was not published. Instead, there was an aposupdateapos on the alleged criminality of his office, his staff, and his personal residence, and the PM greeted it in the same way he has every Mirror front page, ITV broadcast, and BBC breaking news update since late November: a burst of surprise and contrition with a half-le of . seconds, decaying into toxic belligerence that will linger in the bone for a thousand years. Events for which there was not enough evidence to merit an investigation by the politan Police had, in the space of a month, uncovered  witnesses,  photographs, and  pieces of paper.Despite the insufficient evidence,  out of  parties, on  dates, have met the evidential threshold for an investigation, on the grounds that those involved knew they were against the rules, there was no reasonable justication for them, and not looking into it would end Cressida Dickaposs career quicker than sending the riot squad into a candlelit vigil.One of them is an alleged gathering in the Downing Street flat on November , , which Mrs Johnsonaposs personal spokeswoman has repeatedly insisted is total nonsense, but about which there seems to be enough evidence to merit weeks of attention by an entire squad of coppers.  While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared. I get it, and I will fix it! He says he is taking personal charge, and setting up the Office of the Prime Minister. So who was in charge of his office for the past three years  Where is the drunken boozehound who careered around Downing Street Friday night drinkathons, encouraging staffers to let off steam with a long chug on the vodka bottle  Who allowed the culture of recklessness and lawlessness, at the heart of a government that was criminalising the same sins in others  Which leader has led his party to a disgrace worse than Windrush or Grenfell or Orgreave Bring me his head! bellows Boris from the Despatch Box. I will slay this beast, the same way that I would have slain Jimmy Savile,only I didnapost think that investigating historical sex abuse was money spaffed up the wall!Other things he has taken personal control of include Brexit, social care, test and trace, the energy crisis, the ministerial code of conduct, the saving of Owen Paterson, and funding for his gold wallpaper. The fact he took personal control of the vaccines may have something to do with the fact that  million people donapost want them. How many times has he taken charge, only for things to spin out of control  How many times has he shaken up the civil service, only to be rattled himself  Read more The nation is now watching the Conservative Party the same way as the rest of the street watches a victim get out of the police car, andto their abuser. They drag with them a whole country into this deranged, gnarled, unhappy misgovernment, back to the man who wonapost promise to publish the full truth in the House of Commons, where he might be held in contempthe failed to, but will promise it in the bar, to the MPs he has lied to for years, and who have been brainwashed into thinking such a promise is a concession rather than a repetition.Meanwhile the PM only appears in public when the public can be kept away from him. Abba tribute bands are raising their prices for satin satire. Andyou want a three-word slogan to describe where we are, it is simply: another fine mess. The PM or his we may get a fixed penalty notice pictures may or may not emerge. He may be out on his ear, or he may convince enough MPs to give him one more go. Itaposs irrelevant, because the fallout of this radioactive scandal will last to the ballot box and beyond it reaches into homes and hearts, to the guts and spines of millions to whom the words aposToryapos and aposPartyapos are now as repugnant as the fact that people like Leshie had their pain doubled and then dismissed by a man whose charm has long since been spent. The Tories got drunk on power, picked a man who can be fooled by a cake, and then dithered about whether to let him keep hurting the rest of us.

This will not be tolerated.Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcallingImage: Getty Images AlloyopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Feb |commentsIt probably seems like a small thing, at best. At worst, a waste of time and resources. It’s not though. It’s important. A tiny triumph. A baby step in the right direction. Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcalling – “targeting people who are shouting things from their vehicles at women girls. This will not be tolerated.” Last week they stopped a van after the occupant yelled at some women who turned out to be plain-clothed police officers. Oh to have seen his face. He was reported for a breach of the Public Spaces Protection Order and is likely to be issued with a £ fine or taken to court, which is another way of saying that he was left in no doubt that THIS IS NOT OK. That’s apparently what men need to be told, reminded of, in no uncertain terms, so they’re one hundred per cent clear. No, it’s not just a bit of harmless fun that we need to lighten up about. It’s horrendous. Scary. Humiliating.  Maybe this concept is confusing because we’re living in an age of sharing, honesty, and talking about everything. Mostly that’s great, but somewhere within this, a simple truth has got lost. Sometimes, it’s good NOT to talk. Sometimes, you need to shut the hell up. Perhaps we need a massive advertising campaign, public service announcement telly commercials and posters everywhere to clearly inform everyone once and for all: Stop telling women what you think of their bodies. Especially when they haven’t asked, which is pretty much always. There are no Thought Police – anyone is free to think whatever they like. The opinions inside someone’s head can’t hurt anyone . The problem comes when they’re broadcast out loud to the woman you’re thinking them about, be it on the street, online, or on a radio show, like that fool who talked about Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay. What you think of the woman’s body is irrelevant, by the way. Evenyou believe it’s a compliment, still keep it to yourself. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but most women do not feel flattered and delighted when a stranger gives them positive feedback about a body part. We feel embarrassed, and frightened. And we’re taught to ignore this behaviour – apart from in Bradford, it’s up to us to deal with it ourselves – to put our heads down, walk quicker, in case the situation escalates.We’re luckywe are only verbally harassed. Even online, where the threat of physical violence is removed, these kind of comments are dangerous, and unacceptable. They perpetuate the belief that women’s appearances are fair game for discussion and debate. That our bodies are anyone’s business but our own. They also ensure that the practice of speaking about women in this way seeps down to future generations, continuing the cycle. It has to stop. As the fight to make our streets safer for women goes on, catcalling being taken seriously in one city in the UK is just a drop in the ocean. But at least it’s a start. Maybe those TV ads aren’t a bad idea – and it’s obvious what music they should be set to. Ronan Keating, You Say It Best, When You Say Nothing At All.

James Bradshaw, , says the builder, who heaposd hired to add a two-storey extension to their house, would only work five-hour days and when confronted about his shoddy workmanship brazenly quit saying he didnapost want the stress .The couple agreed to pay almost £, to the builder, who came recommended by a family friend, for an extension to accommodate their growing family, a job that was supposed to be completed by August . But after months of issues and delays the builder vanished in September, leaving James and his family £, out of pocket and living on a building site. The -year-old says he has since had a surveyor assess the work that had been done, who concluded that it needed to be completely demolished and restarted due to structural issues. When James contacted a solicitor he was advised not to bother taking the builder to court as he wonapost see a penny of his hard-earned savings again - evenhe wins the case.  The sales director has now shared photos of the mess heaposs been left with in a bid to warn other conscientious and decent peopleapos not to fall victim to cowboy builders. James, from Wolverhampton, said: The reason we were having the extension done is because weaposve had a daughter and we have three children living with us already - my son and my fianceaposs two children. We were having the extension done to create two extra bedrooms and to extend the kitchen and dining room to have a bit more space for the kids. It was shocking from day one. He never did a full week, heaposd only turn up two to three times a weekat all and heaposd turn up at :am and leave at pm. Every time the building inspector came to review the work heaposd done it kept getting failed so he had to redo lots of it. Eventually I said to him aposyou need to come in for a meeting because this just isnapost good enoughapos. As he walked through the door he said aposIaposm going to give you your money back and you can get someone  to complete it because I canapost get it done and I donapost want the stress anymoreapos. He only offered us £, back and I just said aposyouaposre a joke and youaposll be hearing from our solicitoraposs. He left our house in the state itaposs in and we havenapost spoken to him since. Itaposs been a nightmare. Itaposs put a lot of strain on mine and my partneraposs le and caused a lot of devastation for our family. Weaposd been saving the money for about  years and weaposd got a loan to help as well which weaposre still paying back at the minute.  The two-storey extension was supposed to create two extra bedrooms and an extended kitchen and dining area within  weeks, for an agreed cost of £,. By the time of their final meeting in September - two months after the extension was supposed to be finished - there was only an incomplete single-storey and a plank of wood blocking where the back door used to be. The following month, an independent building survey confirmed that what was built was plagued with structural issues and needed to be completely demolished and restarted, despite the parents already forking out a whopping £,. The report found that the walls were out of square in numerous places and either had a cavity that was too wide or cavity ties that were too short. This means they werenapost fully tied in and didnapost provide full stability. It also noted that the entire structure was at risk of damp due to multiple issues, including mortar breaching the wall cavities, and aposlazy workmanshipapos was evident in the internal brickwork, where a broken brick aposlooked to have been jammed in placeapos. Overall the report concluded: Considering the overall condition of the build we would recommend that it is removed down to foundation level and the structure started again. Demolishing the work alone would cost an additional £. In light of this, James sought legal advice to try and claw back some of his hard-earned savings back to be able to recty the nightmare build.  But the dad says that his solicitor then delivered the devastating news that although he would definitely win in court he would never see a penny of the £, again because the builder could simply close the business down due to not having the funds to repay it. James said: I had a meeting with the solicitor and said aposdonapost tell me what I want to hear, tell me the honest truthapos. Her words were aposthe only person that wins in this is the solicitors because we get paid either way, itaposs going to cost you £, to £, to go to courtapos. She said aposyou will win in court but his solicitor will advise him to shut the company down because he hasnapost got the money to pay it back so you wonapost see a pennyapos.Two days after we received the court letter it came up on Facebook that the company was closed so I think heaposs already shut it down. Weaposve looked into his history a bit now as well and heaposs well known for opening companies and shutting them down - I think this is the fourth company heaposs done that with since . The family had new builders start at their home last week to demolish the unstable structure and restart the extension. But at a new estimated cost of £,, they can no longer afford to get much of the project done. The heartbroken dad hopes that by warning people about the dishonest and unreliable cowboy he fell victim to, he can help other families avoid the same fate. James said: Thereaposs nothing we can do now, we just have to bite the bullet that weaposre not going to get anything from it because the system doesnapost support this kind of thing. Weaposve got new builders in now but because weaposve wasted so much money we can only afford to get the shell done and weaposll have to do the inside stage by stage. The new quote to put right and finish it is £, because thereaposs been a huge increase in prices of building materials and labour as well as the extra work of demolishing it.

Most of the officers investigated were police constables and based at Charing Cross Station, according to the Independent Office for Police Conduct , leading to a number of recommendations in a report. In one disgusting chat two officers talk about hitting their female partners before blaming women in general for getting murdered by men.  It read: Officer : “I f**ing need to take my bird out, won’t see her until next Saturday. Then I have to work. Promised to take her out the Friday after. Making it up to her from when I backhanded her. Officer : “Grab her by the pussy.” Officer : “You ever slapped your missus  It makes them love you more. Seriously since I did that she won’t leave me alone. Now I know why these daft c**ts are getting murdered by their sp****c boyfriends. Knock a bird about and she will love you. Human nature. They are biologically programmed to like that shit.” Officer : “Lmao. Officer : “I’m right though.”  In another exchange a male officer sent a string of messages to a female colleague: “I would happily rape you.” “If I was single I would actually hate fuck you. “If I was single I would happily chloroform you.”One police officer was even referred to as “Mcrapey Raperson” in a WhatsApp exchange.The report noted that not all the police officers in the team shared these views, but they also found evidence that police officers were afraid of speaking out. Those who did were harassed, humiliated and excluded, with women told should “play the game or stay quiet”, or leave. The report also shows officers used homophobic language and shared a number of racist messages including references to African children, Somali people and Auschwitz that are too offensive to print. Responding to the report Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “Being a police officer is a privilege which has been abused by these sickening officers.“It has been clear for some time that there are problems with the culture of the politan Police, which is why last year I tasked the Angiolini Inquiry and the police inspectorate with investigating these deeply concerning issues. “I expect the politan Police and the Mayor of London to implement the recommendations of this report as soon as practically possible. The public rightly expects the behaviour of the police to be beyond reproach - standards must be raised.” Of the  officers investigated, two were dismissed for gross misconduct, two resigned and several face disciplinary action Nine are still serving in the force.

The -year-old mum of two - who is a full-time carer to disabled son Tommy, aged  - has now lived without heating for more than a month.“Itaposs really upsetting because I feel like a failure of a mother. I can choose between keeping my house warm at the moment and feeding the kids. “And the kids need to be fed but they need to be warm, it’s quite upsetting. No one should have to choose between feeding or eating.” Beth is one of the . million UK householders whose heating is powered by oil as her home in the rural hamlet of Dartshill, Somerset does not have a mains gas supply.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Her problem started as the cost to heat her family home, which she rents, rose sharply - from £ to £ for  litres, to fill less than half the tank.The cost of living crisis has left the mum, Tommy, five, and Gabby, three, forced to share a bed each night.They have a tiny electric heater to warm the bedroom they share, but in the evenings, they can see their breath in their living room when the temperature drops. Desperate to keep her children warm, Beth bundles them up in jumpers and scarves at home - but Tommy, who is autistic, struggles to wear the outfits. She says: “We’re wearing a lot of extra layers and having to sleep in the same bed to keep warm. “I shut the bedroom door to keep our body heat in but as soon as we got downstairs, it is freezing and we’re all shivering. “It’s a very old draughty cottage, I woke up the other morning around  am to find ice around the windowsill. “We’re wearing a lot more clothes, which means a lot more washing and a backlog of clothes as we wait days for things to dry. “It’s also a choice when it comes to hot water -the kids have a bath, I can’t have a shower as well.” She added: “I have no money and I’m worried about the kids getting ill because it is so cold. “February and March can be the coldest months so I needed to get something done quickly.” Tommy, aged five, is “very delayed” and has to wear specic clothes, meaning he doesn’t like wearing the extra layers.Beth is unable to work after becoming his full-time carer due to his severe epilepsy and the family rely on Universal Credit to get by.She previously tried to get a loan but was refused as she still owes around £ from the last loan she received. “I’ve tried everything. I even tried to get a grant in my local area but I heard nothing back,” the mum said. She also claims disability allowance to support him, who spent nine weeks in hospital in , suffering constant seizures. He has to wear a helmet to protect himselfhe falls, and mum Beth is on constant alert for his seizures. “Because of his epilepsy and autism, he is very delayed, and he doesn’t understand why we need to wear these extra clothes,” added Beth. “So trying to keep him warm it’s really dficult, he’s used to having heating and now we don’t have it. “It’s very frustrating for him.”  The desperate mum recently turned toGoFundMeto help cover the £ bill - where one kindhearted stranger donated £ anonymously.The hike in the price of oil comes amid a cost of living crisis with Beth’s rent recently rising by £ per month - a rise she will struggle to cover.

Since marrying in , the couple has made Kensington Palace their official home along with their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Despite having the help of a nanny, the pair are regularly seen taking their children on the school run and reportedly love doing fun activities such as crafts, baking and playing in the garden. But itaposs not all fun - Kate and William can also be strict when they need to be. And according to a source, there is one rule in their home that the couple is firm on following - and are likely to keep up eventhey move house. They told the Sun : Shouting is absolutely ‘off limits’ for the children and any hint of shouting at each other is dealt with by removal.But rather be sent off to their bedrooms or to the naughty step when they act up, the royal couple have a dferent technique - the sofa chat. The source added: The naughty child is taken away from the scene of the row or disruption and talked to calmly by either Kate or William.

The Cambridge family currently split their time between their official London home of Kensington Palace and their weekend retreat of Amner Hall in Norfolk But they are said to be ready to move as living in suburbia makes total sense. According to the , the pair, who are parents to eight-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, six, and three-year-old Prince Louis, are eyeing up a move to Windsor and are interested in the Fort Belvedere residence. In , it became the home of Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VIII - and it is where he signed his abdication papers in .Meanwhile, last year, it was reported that William and Kate were seriously considering relocating to Windsor to be closer to the Queen and royal decision making.A move to Windsor would also see them nearer Kateaposs family, who is based not far away in Bucklebury. A source told the Mail on Sunday at the time: “Anmer Hall made sense while William was a helicopter pilot in East Anglia and it was useful for Christmases at Sandringham, but it doesn’t really work anymore. It’s a little too far away for weekends, but Windsor is a perfect compromise. They are eyeing up options in the area.

The stag do theory would make sense, as dressing as comical or current characters is often part of the culture, but one or two things possibly rule it out.

Snapped from a road in Leicester, the photo shows East Park Road in North Evington, a deep orange and almost red sunset. A silver line streaking through the middle of the sky can also be made out.The photo was taken at pm on Sunday, January , which just happened to be the same night that a fireball meteor was spotted blazing across the night sky in the UK, reports the Leicester Mercury. There were more than  reported sightings of the meteor on Saturday evening - however, most were slightly later in the day, at around pm. As well as in the UK, the meteor was also spotted across Europe as it made its way across the sky.The UK Meteor Network confirmed the sighting on Twitter, saying: The fireball... was a Sporadic type with an interesting orbit, in perihelion itaposs inside Mercuryaposs orbit.Went down to km but no meteorite. It was described a leaving a green and blue trail as it entered the Earthaposs atmosphere. Twitter user @SydneyEggbert said: Caught it on my Teslacam last night, driving North on the M near Birmingham.It was spotted in Wakefield, Yorkshire, according to Yorkshire Live, as well as across north Wales and Scotland.But due to the slightly earlier timing of the Leicester photograph, there is uncertainty as to what caused it. It could be a lens flare from a nearby streetlight, a flaming meteor, or something completely dferent altogether.

But the former teacher says she must leave the terraced home by February  as she faces bankruptcy proceedings brought by Stoke-on-Trent City Council in a row over £,. Monica says the dispute dates back to  when the council intended to pay her a £, work-related settlement. It later transpired the council had paid the amount twice in error - and Monica didnapost realise until it was too late.The money owed has now leapt to £, due to court fees, Stoke-on-Trent Live.  The -year-old said: “The council gave me a cheque which I put it into the bank account. I waited for four days and then started paying stuff out. But it appears they also paid the money into my account via bank transfer. “From July to December,  I had no income at all. There were bills that needed to be paid and I had quite a few family bereavements. It was a really crazy time. “The council said they had overpaid me in late December    early January . At that time my father was in hospital and he subsequently died. When he died he had an outstanding amount of le insurance which was around £,. He had expected to live for longer. “I genuinely didn’t notice my account balance. I had two young children under the age of three and I had my dad, who meant the world to me, unexpectedly pass. He had no prior illnesses. He was  but didnapost look a day over . “I cannot explain how mental that time of my le was. I had been left for nearly six months with no money at all. “The first thing I did was pay a bulk amount down on my mortgage because it hadn’t been paid for six months. It wasn’t a case of looking at my money, it was the case of knowing that money is here and to pay people. “We realised dad needed to pay around £, on his le insurance in order for the body to be collected.”  Grieving Monica says she also gave £, to her aunt and uncle to get her cousin’s body flown back to the UK after he died in Jamaica. After paying off her expenses she looked at her bank account and realised she still had £, left - and knew something was wrong. She says she offered to pay the council £, and then come up with a payment plan for the remaining £,. But Monica says this was rejected by the council. She added: “What the council is trying to do now is force the sale of my house which means I’ll have nowhere to live. I’ve checked to seeI can get housing but I can’t. “I’ve checked to seeI could get any money from the sale of the house but I won’t really. I might end up with £, maybe. It wonapost be a deposit for another house and I won’t get that immediately.” Monica has started packing her belongings already. She added: “It’s disgusting. I think the council has shown a complete and utter lack of empathy. I have no idea how they can pay me in error and then have me in court. “I was so embarrassed, even though I’ve done nothing wrong. The council made the mistake. I can’t figure out why it’s been allowed to happen. They made the mistake but they are punishing me and my children for it. “It’s their incompetence that has caused me and my four kids to face being left without a home. This is our forever home. “I have been so stressed about it. I’ve got this thing about remaining positive in negative situations. I’ve got four little people who depend on me and that has been my light.” A council spokesman said: The dispute with Mrs Cru-Hall has been ongoing since . Stoke-on-Trent City Council does not treat applications for bankruptcy lightly, and these are only applied when there is no other alternative. We consider that all action taken against Mrs Cru-Hall to recover public money has been carried out in a reasonable, fair and timely manner. A debtor has ample opportunities to pay or agree a mutually beneficial payment plan throughout the recovery process, as well as being offered the chance to pay the outstanding money in full. We have tried to communicate with her, however with no reasonable offers of repayment, ultimately this has led the case to progress to court. Stoke-on-Trent City Council is not making Mrs Cru-Hall homeless, nor have we been asked to assist with any further applications from her. We liaise with the courts and the Citizenaposs Advice Bureau to the best of our ability but are mindful of the council’s duty to protect the public purse. We engage and discuss options with any debtors who inform us that they are experiencing financial dficulties, to set in place the best form of recovery for them. As part of that process, we signpost people to agencies that offer free financial help and guidance.

Lauren Grfiths was driving home from work to Ammanford in South Wales in her Range Rover Velar when the vehicle lost power all of a sudden. The -year-old managed to park the £k car outside her home in Llwyngwern, Hendy, near Swansea.But it then burst into flames right next to her three-storey home, reports The Sun.The foot health specialist did manage to rush away from the burning vehicle but the flames quickly spread to her home and her neighboursapos homes. Three fire engines spent two and a half hours fighting the fire as it spread through Laurenaposs home.The mum told the Sun: There were blue sparks coming from the grill and quite a bit of smoke, it was terrying. “I wasn’t able to switch the engine off either. I was pressing the start stop button and nothing was happening and there was a loud banging from underneath the bonnet.  Panicking, Lauren grabbed her two sons and ran into the garden of her house as she called . Then a passerby helped the family into another nearby garden where they could keep away from the fire. Lauren described how all the neighbours ran out into the garden and everyone watched shocked as the Range Rover exploded.  She said it was like a bomb had gone off as there was debris everywhere. That was when firefighters arrived on the scene to tackle the blaze. Lauren has claimed Range Rover wonapost take liability for the car because it was two months over its warranty. She added that she has gone to Land Rover for everything, from the caraposs MOT and wear and tear issues to even the oil top ups.  And everything was fine after its MOT which only happened in November. The Mirror has contacted Jaguar Land Rover for a comment. Laurenaposs landlord said her home is now a health and safety risk and she cannot salvage anything from inside, including her sonaposs first hair and teeth.  A Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: On attendance, crews were confronted with a car fire that had spread to a semi-detached property and was well alight. Firefighters extinguished the fire using four breathing apparatus, two hose reel jets, two thermal imaging cameras and a short extension ladder. The fire had destroyed the vehicle and had caused fire and smoke damage throughout the property. Neighbouring properties had also suffered heat damage from the fire. The Police and Western Power were also in attendance. The Fire Service ventilated the property, using a positive pressure ventilation fan, and left the incident at :pm. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental. A Land Rover spokesman told The Sun: Customer safety is our highest priority. We are aware of the incident and we sympathise with Ms Grfiths’ experience, the cause of which is yet to be determined. We have duly offered mobility to the customer and are willing to support an investigation by the insurer – the process for which, requires the insurer to investigate first, to avoid any adverse effect on Ms Grfiths’ home and vehicle insurance policies.

The Duke of Cambridge celebrates the landmark on June , weeks after the Platinum Jubilee. A royal expert claims she has been getting down to work to make sure itaposs the perfect day for the Prince. The Monarch has a big thing planned for his birthday this summer in what will be a huge month for the royal family. Royal expert Christopher Andersen, author of The Brothers and Wives: Inside the Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry, and Meghan, says something special is brewing. Speaking to US Weekly he claimed: The Queen has a big thing planned for William and he is going to throw something as well.There will be big parties again,Covid allows anything like that to happen. It was reported that the Cambridges threw a aposlow-keyapos bash for Kateaposs th, organised by William and their three kids - Prince George, , Princess Charlotte, , and Prince Louis, , in January. But where will they see in Williamaposs th The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have reportedly left members of their London circle aposaghastapos by considering a move to Berkshire.The royal couple currently split their time between their official London home of Kensington Palace and their weekend retreat of Amner Hall in Norfolk and are said to be ready to move as living in suburbia makes total sense. According to the , the pair are eyeing up a move to Windsor - and are interested in the Fort Belvedere residence. The publication writes: Their London circle is aghast – what’s wrong with Anmer Hall, their -bedroom weekend house in Norfolk  – and so, too, are their green-welly friends, who consider this corner of Berkshire as not proper countryside and horribly naff. However, a source told the paper: People can be very snotty about that area west of London, but that mainly comes out of ignorance.  It’s picturesque and also meaningfully close to town, unlike other parts of the Home Counties. A move to Windsor would also see them nearer Kateaposs family, who is based not far away in Bucklebury. A source told the Mail on Sunday at the time: “Anmer Hall made sense while William was a helicopter pilot in East Anglia and it was useful for Christmases at Sandringham, but it doesn’t really work anymore. It’s a little too far away for weekends, but Windsor is a perfect compromise. They are eyeing up options in the area.

However, there is one strict rule in particular that staff have to abide bythey want to call Kensington Palace aposthe officeapos. A job advert posted on the Royal Household’s official website, described the housekeeping role as an aposexciting opportunityapos to work for the royal couple and to aposjoin a supportive and positive teamapos. And there is zero-tolerance for gossiping as the couple specied that applicants had to be good at maintaining confidentiality and exercising discretion.

You will be keen to take on new challenges as these arise and develop your own knowledge and skills.” But anyone who wants to apply to be a housekeeper for the Queen has to pass a secret test first, to set the special cleaners from the bunch. According to Tracey Waterman, the head of recruitment, the team sets a secret challenge to all interviewees to see how they react - and those that pass, get the job.  The premise behind it, she explains, is that she will place a dead fly somewhere around the room to seethe candidate notices it and how they dispose of it. Speaking during Channel aposs documentary Sandringham: The Royals at Christmas, she said: The dference between a housekeeper in a five-star hotel and in a royal Palace would be attention to detail. One of the tests I like to do, to seea candidate has a potential eye for detail, is to place a dead fly, either in the fireplace or on the carpet. Once the dead fly is placed, I then bring the candidate into the room. I lead them into the room quite slowly, just giving them a chance to glance at the room, have a little look at what we’ve got inside the room. Bringing them to the fireplace, maybe highlighting that we’ve got a beautul fireplace. It’s this hint that Tracey hopes will make them aware of the dead fly. But it’s not just about spotting the fly she says but what they dothey do notice it. She adds: It’s a great test, maybe out of  people half the candidates will notice the fly. One out of ten will actually bend down and pick it up, that’s the special housekeeper.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Eve, , was on the cream for more than two decades after doctors and skin experts gave her the topical steroids to treat her eczema.They prescribed her stronger and stronger creams until Eve became concerned that even the most potent cream no longer seemed to help her symptoms.She said nobody warned her that the creams were not for long-term use and after decades of applying them she was left with skin crumbling off her face and when she tried to stop using them she ended up in AE.MyLondon reported that Eve had been using the creams since age two and had it on a repeat prescription. She explained: “I could pick one up whenever I wanted. I was putting them all over my body, wasnapost washing my hands afterwards. I didnapost realise youaposre not supposed to use them long-term, no one ever told me, they just said it might thin my skin. I was probably  or  when I started noticing that I was flaring up but it didnapost look like eczema, more like an allergic reaction. My face would look burnt and the scabs would crumble off my face. So Iaposd put on the steroids again and keep using them. But when Eve decided to go cold turkey and come off the steroid creams, she ended up in AE after suffering from an adrenal crisis - the body’s extreme lack of cortisol due to the reliance on steroid creams- which led to anxiety, depression and severe pain. She added: My skin was dry, it was so painful. Iaposve never felt pain like that she said It felt like any clothes touching my skin were going to rip it off. I was shivering, I couldnapost regulate my temperature, I was head to toe covered in an awful rash.  To combat the condition, the doctors once again prescribed her steroid creams. The -year-old lived in Camden, North London, before moving home to her parents in Cambridgeshire while she recovers. But she hopes to move back to Camden once her skin improves. Now, Eve is determined to heal from the damage naturally by forcing her body to be less reliant on the creams, despite the fact she knew it could be two years of hell. After coming off the steroids last summer, she has seen some improvements - but still deals with often debilitating symptoms every day - similar to her ordeal in AE. She said: I get these things called zingers. Itaposs like your nerve endings zapping you. It gives you a tinge all over your body. It feels like being sunburnt all the time. I get really bad insomnia. I probably sleep for three hours a night. Coupled with itching at night. From  - am, I am itchy all over. Like a bone deep itch. Nothing will satisfy it. In a bid to raise awareness of Topical Steroid Withdrawalone evening Eve posted a video on TikTok. By the morning, she woke up to thousands of views and comments from others - praising her for openly speaking about her skin struggles. She added: I try and see the positive but there are nights where you just cry and wish you looked back to normal. I know other people [TSW sufferers] get so so depressed and so down. People think, whataposs the pointI look like this  I want to show people, via my videos, that you can still have a le. Things do get better. On her videos - Eve shares the activities she is looking forward to her once she feels better. These include wearing makeup, being able to drink alcoholand to not have to hoover [her] sheets every day due to the flaking skin. Iaposve been so overwhelmed with the response to my videos, its been nothing but kindness. There is no single negative comment on any of my videos. Itaposs so wild that so many people are going through this and yet nobody knows about the condition. The National Eczema Society said TSW is a complex condition and called for more research to be done, as it is not well understood. As with change to medications, they advise speaking to your doctor before stopping steroid creams. Dr Mark Hudson-Peacock, a consultant dermatologist agreed that the condition is complex, and should be dealt with on a case by case basis.

Filling the gap with glue to hold it firm, she says she has no regrets about her spot of self-dentistry.She says her local dentist closed before the pandemic and has had trouble finding one since. After trying to get an NHS dentist appointment, she took matters into her own hands and applied the treatment in her living room. Mrs Sheen, who suffers from gum disease, said one of her teeth had started to come loose - and went online to come up with a plan to make things better. Two years on, she says she doesnapost regret a thing. She explained: I have bleeding gums every time I clean my teeth and it’s making me not want to clean them as I hate the taste of blood and all my teeth are getting wobbly. One in front was so wobbly it had to come out as I couldn’t eat with it so I put Elastoplast on the end of the pliers and tugged it out. The only thing I could think of was melting glue and moulding it into the gap. It’s been two years now.  It’s working okay, I can actually smile without seeing a gap. NHS England recently announced they would provide an extra £ million for dentists to provide additional urgent care for NHS patients. The unprecedented backlog has left dentistry hanging by a thread with many dentists looking to change careers or seeking early retirement. On January  NHS England pledged an extra £ million for dentists to provide additional urgent care for NHS patients. Funding will be available until the end of March and will be paid on a sessional basis. “Any additional funding is long overdue recognition of the huge backlogs facing NHS dentistry” said General Dental Practice Committee Chair Shawn Charlwood. “After a decade of cuts a cash-starved service risks being offered money that can’t be spent. Hard-pressed practices are working against the clock, and many will struggle to find capacity ahead of April for this investment to make a dference. “Until today not a penny of the government’s multi-billion-pound catch-up programme had reached dentistry. This is progress but must be just the startwe are to rebuild a service millions depend on.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDentist\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jess tipped the scales at  stone and one pound when she was at her heaviest. The support worker was a size  and she had spent years gorging on junk food after being trapped in an abusive relationship.She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia - a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body - and decided to get into shape. Through a combination of exercise and a low-fat diet, Jess lost an incredible  stone and four pounds in just one year. Jess is now a size  and weighs nine stone and nine pounds, and she says she now has about  pounds of excess skin, which swings whenever she walks.She is now hoping to fund an operation by setting up a GoFundMe page. Jess, from Bredon, Worcs., said: I still see myself as largely overweight due to the skin and it has got me down. I had thought of cutting the skin off myself. Iaposve lost all the weight through exercise and diet but I really need help to get the body I really want. At one point I was basically bed bound but I still exercised using arm and leg machines. Itaposs been really hard work but Iaposm so proud of what Iaposve achieved. Jess piled on the pounds after getting hooked on burgers and pizzas washed down with bottles of full-fat coke. Her health deteriorated so much her doctors told her lungs were being crushed under her own weight. Jess decided to make a change in January  and swapped fast food in for vegetables, rice and brown toast.  She said: I was basically eating from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep. I ate everything basically from chocolate to fast food to snacks. My illnesses meant I could hardly move, sometimes it was so bad I couldnapost even lt my head and my weight made it even worse. Even on my good days I couldnapost do much - so exercising along with my diet was a hard feat. But I did what I could.  I bought a foot pedal and I would sit on my sofa and pedal away for as long as I could. It would exhaust me and Iaposd crash out for the afternoon or the next day. As the weight started to slowly drop off I felt proud. It was working. Soon I had dropped a dress size and I started to feel more confident glancing at myself in the mirror.  Jess, who lives with partner James, , now hopes to raise enough money to pay a private clinic to have her saggy skin removed. She said: It causes a lot of discomfort. The skin can throw me off balanceit swings as I walk. Itaposs like carrying a heavy duvet around my middle. I have to wear waist trainers and shapewear all the time to hold it in place which is often painful and uncomfortable.Iaposve lost all the weight on my own and Iaposm determined to have the operation to remove the skin without being a burden on the NHS.The reason I put the weight on was because I was in an abusive relationship. I want to show people in similar situations that it is possible to change your le and lestyle. I just need a bit of help to get me where I want to be.

Courtney Lyn wanted a tattoo of Rocket the raccoon, a fictional character from the Marvel movie s of the Galaxy, on her arm.However, she was horried after realising part of the design looked more phallic than intended, DailyStar reports. She shared the video on TikTok, which has been viewed more than two million times, leaving many in stitches. The woman said in the video: It was supposed to be a knee cap. But it doesnapost look like a knee cap, it looks like a penis! She then shows the whole tattoo, showing Rocket holding a laser cannon while seemingly kneeling on the ground. Courtney showed off the reference photo, adding: Look at this knee cap in question, there is a line there. Hefollowed it correctly, unfortunately. I donapost knowthataposs a fold in the clothing, a crack in the knee pad or whatever, but he followed it. I donapost want to correct someone who does it professionally. ButI saw that from an artistaposs standpoint, I would probably think, aposHmmm I’m not going to do that.apos  Or, as some of you have suggested, do some shading. She also said the tattoo artist had worked on her previously – adding she was watching him doing the inking the whole time. However, it wasnapost until she went back home and saw the tattoo in the mirror that she saw it for what it was. Many TikTokers giggled as they made the same realisation. One commented said: Itaposs only missing the veins. Another wrote: They most likely did that on purpose. Whose knee cap looks like that  Some asked Courtney to make sure the tattoo artist covered the stroke up when she goes back for the finishing touches. Courtney said: Iaposm getting it coloured in, Iaposm finding a dferent tattoo artist, and no Iaposm not giving himlegs, he will be on his knees, and I will not be doing it red.

But one woman on Reddit has discovered her parents still donapost want her sharing a bed with her signicant other when they go over to visit, even though theyaposre both adults and are married - and even have children.Sharing her story anonymously, the -year-old woman explained she was recently visiting her parents with her husband and their two sons and was getting ready to settle down for the night when her mum told her husband he would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. And when asked why, all her mum could say was that her dad doesnapost feel comfortable with them sharing a bed under their roof. She wrote: My husband and I are visiting my family. My husband, kids and I were getting ready to go to our room for bed when my parents started acting really awkward. Like something was off. I asked them what was wrong and my mum quietly told me that my husband should sleep on the couch in the living room. I was a bit shocked because ... why  Apparently, my dad doesn’t feel comfortable. I called her and my dad weird and told my husband to ignore them. We finally put our kids to sleep and were getting ready to sleep when my mum barged into the room while we were changing and said that she doesn’t want us in the same room alone in her house.  My husband was freaking terried at this point because he was in the middle of changing, so he leaves for the couch and my mum says she’s sorry but she’s not in the mood to deal with my dad’s complaining all night. The woman said she got up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water and noticed her husband was still wide awake, so went and sat with him for a moment - until they both accidentally fell asleep on the sofa together. She added: I got up at like  am to drink some water and I saw my husband wide awake just lying on the couch. He said the couch is uncomfortable as f**k, so I sat down next to him and we both accidentally fell asleep. I woke up later to my mum freaking out. She was whisper yelling so she didnapost wake up my dad and askedwe’re that co-dependent on each other that we can’t spend one night alone. I tried explaining that it was a mistake but she kept calling me disrespectful and said that I was selfish. I was upset but my son called for me so we ended our conversation.  And even though the sofa nap was an honest mistake, the woman has been branded disrespectful by her family - but doesnapost understand why her parents are being so weird about the situation. She said: Now I’m wonderingI really am the a**hole in this situation  My mum says I am because I was being selfish, disrespectful and completely disregarded how dficult her le would’ve becomemy dad found us. My whole thing is that it was an accident, I’m , and my dad is being weird. Commenters on the Reddit post were baffled by the parentsapos actions, as many of them said it was strange to keep the married couple apart, especially when they already have children together. One person said: If youaposre married and have kids, they should respect your marriage and let you guys sleep together. Itaposs hard enough falling asleep in someone aposs house, at least let the people have the comfort of having their spouse there to sleep with. While another added: What kind of shenanigans is this  I don’t see why your dad has any issues with you sleeping in the same room with your husband. You guys have kids so clearly sex has happened.

The now-abandoned building is captured in eerie snaps that show miles and miles of corridors that snake through the building. Arkadiusz Podniesiski captured the shots inside the infamous landmark. The -year-old from Wroclaw, Poland spent two days at the site in Ukraine in March last year. Using a Nikon D he captured the insides of Chernobyl and has been documenting the effects of the Chernobyl disaster since .  Other images show once-used porcelain tableware with the power plant’s logo, or shattered clocks and giant telephone switchboards which such places once relied upon. The insides of the airtight caissons and hot chambers are shown as well, this is where the radioactive waste produced by nuclear fission is cut, shredded and sorted by radioactivity before it’s compressed and incinerated. On April , , the world’s worst nuclear disaster took place in northern Ukraine, close to the Belarusian border.  An experiment that was designed to test the power plant’s safety measures went drastically wrong.It caused an explosion in the reactor and led to a fire which spewed radiation for  days.Over , people were evacuated from the surrounding area and the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was set up in a -mile radius from the damaged reactor. This was later expanded and radioactive clouds travelled across Europe. Arkadiusz gained exclusive access inside the power plant, including a rare tour inside the sarcophagus.  He was just  when the disaster happened and remembers the time vividly, so when the chance to travel there came up  years ago he jumped at it. He told the Daily Mail that going there for the first time “changed my le forever” and was honoured to be one of the few photographers in the world able to go inside the sarcophagus. The photographs he took he said were important historical documents and key to remembering Chernobyl.  When talking about what it was like inside the reactor building, he said: “In this labyrinth of near-identical corridors, I quickly lose my sense of direction and, after a while, I stop paying attention to the signs. “I blindly follow the dosimetrist. Although the masks prevent us from breathing in radioactive dust, there is nothing we can do to protect ourselves from the gamma radiation penetrating our bodies. “Unseen dangers may lurk around every corner. In such a situation, the dosimeters are our eyes thanks to them we know how far we can go.”  However, Arkadiusz has visited not just Chernobyl but Fukushima as well, many times throughout his le so he is more than used to staying safe in such environments. He uses protective equipment inside such as a hazmat and is forced to only shoot with one hand as he carries the dosimeterin his other hand.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools. But we need to keep thinking long term.#"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts january 28 2022","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Craignish Village Hall is to host a bike clinic.Bring your bike along to Craignish Village Hall on January  and have it looked over by qualied cycle technicians at socially-distanced workstations.The workshop is suitable for anyone wanting to learn how to keep their bike in good working order and to increase their basic cycle maintenance skills.Organisers hope balance bikes will be available for budding cyclists, as well as ebikes for adults to try.Tea and coffee will be provided and there is no need to book.This workshop is supported by Craignish Village Hall and the Corra Foundation in  collaboration with Act, The Ardrishaig Bothy and local Cycling UK project co-ordinator Joanne Clark.Unpaid carers in communities near Cairndow may soon be able to take a well-earned breather thanks to a scheme proposed by community enterprise Here We Are.The #sit-in# service would allow volunteers to sit with a cared-for person to give the carer a break, or perhaps the volunteer might simply drop in for a chat with someone living alone.Staff at Here We Are, based at Clachan beside the Tree Shop, are currently looking into how the scheme might work in Cairndow and Strachur and would like to hear from anyone who might benefit from this free community service.Contact Dot Chalmers or Fiona Campbell at Here We Are on  , or email mail@hereweare-uk for more information.Kilchrenan Primary School parents and education officials have decided to move its six pupils to Taynuilt from Valentine#s Day.Head teacher Graham Dickie is retiring and no-one is in line to replace him.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Taking these factors into consideration parents, in collaboration with the council, have decided to move pupils to Taynuilt from February .#A paper is being prepared for the Community Services Committee to outline the details and options moving forward.#Councillor Elaine Robertson said: #It is always very sad when a local school is no longer operational, both for the families and the community.

We’re playing for a famous trophy and it’s  years old. To have it first up adds to the buzz around the Six Nations. It will focus our minds next week.“The games in November were excellent in terms of seeing fans back when we arrived at the stadium, the noise they generated when we came on to the field and how they helped us through those games. So to have them there for our biggest fixture of the year will be a great boost to us.“We’ve also got three away games this year, so we’ll also have to handle those occasions where the crowd are against us and for the home team. But everyone involved in rugby can’t wait to play in front of supporters again for this Six Nations.”Team captain and former Hawick star Stuart Hogg added: “We know it’s going to be tough and physical, but these are the games you want to be involved in. I know I speak on behalf of everyone involved in the Scotland camp when I say we’re excited for next weekend.“It’s the best opportunity to kick off the Six Nations by playing England at home.

So, those comments are just wrong.”Last month Mr Macron warned that the problem of migrant crossings in the Channel cannot be solved unless the UK changes its policies.The latest comments echo some of those he made while speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg to mark France taking over its six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, when he also said there needs to be “legal, stable” routes to be able to migrate to the UK.More than , people crossed the English Channel to the UK on board small boats in January , according to data compiled by the PA news agency.This is more than six times the number who succeeded in making the dangerous journey in January last year..remove.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Patel: Macron us criticism of British immigration system  ujust wrong u"},{"url":null,"title":"us-could-reach-deal-russia-ease-tensions-missiles-europe","story":"The US could be willing to make an agreement with Russia to ease tensions over missile deployments in EuropeMoscow steps back from the brink in Ukraine, according to a leaked document.Spanish newspaper El Pais published two documents purported to be written replies from the US and Nato last week to Russia’s proposals for a new security arrangement in Europe.The US document, marked as a confidential “non-paper”, said Washington would be willing to discuss in consultation with its Nato partners “a transparency mechanism to confirm the absences of Tomahawk cruise missiles at Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland”.That would happen on condition that Moscow “offers reciprocal transparency measures on two ground-launched missiles bases of our choosing in Russia”.vw,vw,px, px\"Dmitry Peskov Aegis is a system for defending against short or intermediate-range missiles, but Russia has claimed in the past that the US could attack with Tomahawk intermediate-range missiles from Aegis Ashore sites.The US document said Washington would have to consult Nato allies on the potential offer, particularly Romania and Poland.The text of the second document closely reflects statements made to the media by Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg as he laid out the -nation military organisation’s position on Russia’s demands.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the leaked documents, saying only: “We didn’t release anything.”In comments to the state RIA Novosti news agency, Russia’s Foreign Ministry also refused to confirm or deny that the documents were authentic.Fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine have mounted in recent months after President Vladimir Putin deployed more than , troops to areas near Ukraine’s borders, including in neighbouring Belarus, backed by tanks, artillery, helicopters and warplanes.Mr Putin says he does not intend to order an invasion.The US underlined after its written proposals in the leaked document that “progress can only be achieved on these issues in an environment of de-escalation with respect to Russia’s threatening actions towards Ukraine”..remove.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: US  ucould reach deal with Russia u to ease tensions over missiles in Europe"},{"url":null,"title":"address-haggis-full-burns-night-history-explained","story":"What is an Address to the Haggis PLANNING a Burns Night supper If you’re serving haggis, you might want to honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances.

Ordnance Survey [OS    ] lists the house as “A toll gate at which road dues are collected between Linton and Dunbar.“It is the property of the County road trustees, and is at present occupied by Gilbert Miller.”Thus it can be concluded that East Linton did, indeed, have a turnpike toll-house, probably dating back at least to the mid-th century when the tollbars were set up and the houses constructed along the main turnpike road.Like the other tolls mentioned here, it was a casualty to the railways being constructed, reducing road traffic very considerably and starving the toll-keepers out of existence in late Victorian times.But where is the old toll-house today There is no building on the main road past East Linton in any way resembling a toll-house, and the crossroads where it once stood has long since disappeared after a scheme to construct a bypass outside the village.Computerised super-imposition of a present-day map of East Linton onto Forrest’s  map indicates that the toll-house would be situated close to what is today Lauder Place.And, indeed, a stroll through those parts reveals the existence of the ‘Old Toll House’, accessed through a driveway from Lauder Place.A humble, single-story building just like the other East Lothian toll-houses, it has been signicantly extended at the back.By the present owner, it was identied as the former toll-house by the original deeds, which have since been mislaid.It would today have had a most tranquil situation, far from any of the major roads, had not the mainline railway been just a few feet away, with the trains roaring by with a deafening noise.When its present owner bought the old toll-house  years ago, it was in decent repair, albeit very small and cramped.Curiously, there was then a three foot square stone built room with a small window with iron bars, a prison cell perhaps, intended for people who refused to pay the toll But since the toll-keepers had no powers to imprison people, perhaps it was rather a whisky store, since the toll-keepers often doubled as low-level publicans It is also possible that the magistrates required a convenient holding-cell for local offenders before taking them to a burgh tolbooth.Since the ‘cell’ has long since been removed and the toll-house extensively renovated, with no original features remaining, we will never know.The East Lothian authorities built their toll-houses sturdy and strong, and the Old Toll House in East Linton is likely to stand for centuries to come.Jan Bondeson"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-malik-power-restored-county-clear-up-effort-underway","story":"Households in parts of Dunbar, East Linton, Innerwick and Garvald who were left without power following the storm this weekend have had their supplies restored.SP Energy Networks, which own and operates the electricity transmission and distribution network in south east Scotland, said that power was restored as quickly as possible following the storm.A statement on its Twitter said: \"We’d like to apologise to any of our customers who lost power during the storm and thank you for your patience as we work as quickly, and safely, as we can to clear any debris and reconnect services.\"Extreme weather conditions like gale force winds can make it extremely challenging for our engineering teams to fix issues with the network, especiallyclimbing poles or pylons is required.

https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm pic vIoAobCFSSThe First Minister said her advisory sub-group on education met and considered the issue last week.She told MSPs: “It concluded that although we may be close to the time when face coverings no longer need to be worn in the classroom assuming current trends continue, we have not yet reached that stage.“No-one wants young people to have to wear face coverings in the classroom for a moment longer than necessary.“But given the current uncertainty about infection trends in the immediate future, and the relatively high levels of Covid in the younger age groups, continued caution is prudent at this stage.”The new sub-iant - BA. - has been identied and is currently being investigated.The First Minister has said that BA. is \"not a cause for any alarm\" and there is no need to make any change to the current measures at the moment.There has been a total of  cases of the BA. sub-iant of Omicron have been confirmed in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said, though this number is likely to be an underestimate.The First Minister told MSPs: “Genomic sequencing is being used to investigate this further.“So far, I can confirm that in Scotland,  cases of BA. have been confirmed through genomic sequencing but we expect this number to increase as more sequencing results are reported.“And given that not all tests are genomically sequenced, it will be an underestimate of the presence of this sub-iant here.”She said there was no evidence that BA. led to more serious illness or had a greater chance of escaping immunity, however it appeared to be able to “out-run” Omicron.Flu vaccinations have now resumed for vulnerable groups. You should visit the NHS inform website to arrange to get your flu jab. Ms Sturgeon urged those who are eligible for their booster jab to get their vaccine. From February , vaccinated travellers, who are fully vaccinated or under , will no longer need to take a pre-departure Covid test and they will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival until theyve received a negative result.Travellers in this group will still need to take a test on or before day  after arriving in the UK - which can be a lateral flow device rather than a PCR test from Sunday.Anyone who tests positive on their lateral flow test will need to isolate and take a free confirmatory PCR test.The new measures apply across the UK after an agreement between the UK Government and the three devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon warned last week that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. See the full guidance via the Scottish Government website.Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

I sell to fishermen and ious people the majority of whom are connected to the sea or rivers in some way.”From his studio Sam creates impressions of fish using the tactile effects that metal , its processes and techniques have to offer.“Because all the scales are hand done and beaten, you can go a wee bit mad,” he laughs. “I did once count how many hammer blows were in one of the herring that I do and there was .”Sam’s work has been featured on TV and he has also shown at group exhibitions in galleries including the House of Bruar, the Royal Scottish Academy, The Wykeham Gallery and Visions West Gallery, Montana.www.sam-macdonald ROIS SCOTTISH SEA GLASSFor Rois Clark, one person’s trash truly is another person’s treasure. Since , Rois, , has been creating unique pieces of jewellery from the sea glass she finds on Scotland’s coasts.“I’d noticed someone making shell and sea glass jewellery in Hawaii years ago, and I’d never seen it used that way before,” she says.“I started to look around beaches in Scotland and found we had our own sea glass. Then I noticed how dferent shores have produce dferent types of sea glass – the colours, types of bottles and textures were unique to the conditions of the that particular coastline.”Rois Clark Rois, who is based in Glasgow, admits the main source of satisfaction from her work derives from creating meaningful jewellery from broken pieces of old discarded glass.“My background is in Student Ministry,” she comments, “mostly working with younger vulnerable women.“I find it quite a prayerful practice making treasure out of the broken pieces – the action for me is a symbol of hope. We’ve all had our own tumultuous journey, and many vulnerable people can feel a little broken themselves, but when handled with care and attention things can change.”Rois collects her sea glass from over  beaches all over Scotland, gathering samples of ying shapes, colours, and textures. Each piece of jewellery is handpicked, handmade and comes with a map stating where it was found.She says: “I’d say  per cent of people who select my products choose it for the location aspect. A lot of the time people share a story about why that location means so much to them.”www.roisseaglass IONA TURNER ARTISTSince graduating from Glasgow School of Art last June, artist Iona Turner has impressed many with her original jewellery made from seaweed foraged from Scotland’s beaches.Growing up in Edinburgh, Iona chose  to spend a lot of her time by the sea and since the age of  she has been a seasonal surf instructor in East Lothian.Iona Turner “I began working with the materials that I was foraging there after developing a desire to make something using the natural surroundings,” she says.“I came to seaweed through foraging it for food, that’s how I got a bit more familiar with its materiality.“The process I have is low-impact and a sensitive approach to the seaweed – I don’t meddle too much with it before making my pieces.”Iona forages for seaweed that’s been ripped up by natural processes, such as after a storm or a big swell. The storm-cast knotted-wrack seaweed is used to make her bold statement pieces of jewellery.She says: “I really like that I get to collect the material myself and source it from places that I love. I also love working with a material where there is no waste from it – any discards are made into compost. And what I really enjoy most about the seaweed is that I get to be the supply chain.“I think my buyers are drawn to my pieces because of the sense of the closeness to nature and the fact that they are buying something that doesn’t have the same consumer guilt that other products can have. Just having that connection to a coastal place is also a big draw.”www.instagram iona.maker"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions. The success of DRS in Scotland, however, will depend on ensuring we get the details right, not just in our cities but in rural and island settings as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up.

We’ll burn their pictures and propaganda posters,” the man says.“We will break their idols. We will reveal their palaces so that the people can punish them.”The Justice of Ali released footage in August showing grim condition at Iran’s notorious Evin prison, which it claimed it obtained through a hack.The video came just ahead of commemoration ceremonies for Iran’s  Islamic Revolution this month.It also followed an apparent hack last Thursday that saw multiple channels of Iran’s state television broadcast images showing the leaders of an exiled dissident group and a graphic calling for the death of the country’s supreme leader.The incident on Tuesday potentially marks the latest in a series of embarrassing cyber attacks against the Islamic Republic, as world powers struggle to revive a tattered nuclear deal with Tehran.Other attacks, which Iran has blamed on Israel, have targeted its nuclear programme.In October, an assault on Iran’s fuel distribution system paralysed petrol stations nationwide, leading to long queues of angry motorists unable to get subsidised fuel for days.An earlier cyber attack on Iran’s railway system caused chaos and train delays.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Me being myself should not be not allowed. vw,vw,px, px\"Makayla Gerken-Schofield is proud to be a pansexual athlete at the Winter Olympics “Going to an Olympics gives me even more visibility, and it is important for young people out there, whether athletes or not, to have that person who could inspire them to be able to come out or get out those feelings that are buried inside.“I’ve already had a few messages and stories from people, and a tear comes to my eye because it is something that touches me – the fact that people have the confidence to come to me and speak out is something that has touched my heart.”Gus Kenworthy and Bruce Mouat are among the openly gay athletes also representing Great Britain in China, whose official national TV regulator issued an edict in September ordering broadcasters to “resolutely put an end to sissy men and other abnormal aesthetics.”It raised fears of a crackdown on freedom of speech during the Games, amid a backdrop of allegations of serious human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, and the jailing of protestors in Hong Kong.A total of more than  openly LGBTQ+ athletes will be competing in Beijing, including American figure skater Timothy Leduc, who will become the first non-binary Winter Olympian when they compete with partner Ashley Cain-Gribble this week.“Ashley and I represent an alternative programme in pairs skating,” said Leduc. “We just like to present a dferent narrative and hopefully make more space for other stories to be told in skating.”British Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson has previously stressed that all members of the -strong British team will be fully supportedthey choose to speak out.And Gerken-Schofield, who competed at her first World Championships in Sierra Nevada in , says she has been inspired by the response of fellow athletes following her decision to go public about her sexuality.“I’ve always felt comfortable within my discipline, and some of the athletes have come up to me and said they proud of me for coming out,” she added.“I feel like I’m being myself more.

And recent developments are likely to reinforce this stance.”The hit to growth is likely to have been “more modest” than first feared, he added, while recent official figures confirmed the UK jobs market continues to fire on all cylinders with little impact from the end of furlough.But the Bank is still left with a dficult decision, given the knock to consumer pockets from looming energy bills and fuel price rises – which policymakers are powerless to control with rate hikes.Governor Andrew Bailey recently told MPs there were also worrying signs that inflation pressures may last longer than first thought, with sky-high wholesale energy prices now looking likely to last until the second half of .He also cautioned over recent signals of more broad-based wage rises across the UK economy.Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said: “The Bank of England can’t control the major factors that will push inflation up in the immediate future, such as global energy prices or elevated shipping costs.“But a February rate hike would help persuade the market that the Bank really means business, and help to stave off embedded inflationary expectations that could spark a dreaded wage-price spiral.”Economists are split on how many rate rises there will be this year, but many believe the Bank will be more cautious with the pace, especiallyit moves to begin scaling back its £ billion quantitative easing programme.The Bank has already said it would consider so-called quantitative tightening when rates hit .%, which means the Bank could make the announcement alongside Thursday’s decision and see it lead the charge among its central bank counterparts.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4404766.jpg--.jpg?1643191025000\n","title":"history made at kells connor wi","story":" Kells  Connor WI made history in  when their AGM was held in a cattle shed , courtesy of the McAllister family.New President, Rosemary McAllister and her Committee members were elected including Anna Murphy , Eleanor Worthington , Helen Mitchell , Jill Crockard , Wilma Buick , Mary Crothers  Gwen Henson , Olga O’Neill  Iris Manson , Angela Currieand Sharon Graham The competition winners for the Bell Challenge Cup were: st – Maura Ellis, nd – Angela Currie and joint rd Sally Harper  Rosemary Farquhar.Maura Ellis spoke about her avid crafting interests and showed some of the wonderful exhibits made the talented Kells  Connor WI craftswomen.The ladies subsequently attended their annual Christmas dinner in the more luxurious surroundings of the Rosspark Hotel, where they enjoyed a delicious meal and held a quiz afterwards.

He was ordained in  as an assistant minister in Megain Memorial and Mersey Presbyterian Churches in East Belfast. When he became minister in Portrush, he also represented PCI in its partner relationships in Central and Eastern Europe until .Having attended Ballymena County Primary School and Coleraine Academical Institution, he went on to study farm management at Greenmount Agricultural College from -, with an agri career in mind. This led to three years of study at the University of Ulster’s, Coleraine campus, where in  he gained a BSc in Social Science and Environmental Studies. After spending a year working for the Department of Agriculture, in  he attended Belfast Bible College before starting his studies at Union Theological College for the ordained ministry of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the same year.Talking about his faith, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “With a father and a grandfather as Presbyterian ministers, you might say that I am not only ‘a son of the Manse’, but ‘a grandson of the Manse’ as well. While I came to a personal faith in Jesus at the age of nine, there was never an expectation that I would follow in their footsteps. But God, obviously, had other plans and I genuinely give thanks for the near  years I have spent in the ordained ministry.”Today he ministers to a congregation of around  families in and around the seaside town, which grows considerably during the summer months and at Easter. “I would describe myself as a ‘preaching pastor’, as I see the linked importance of preaching and teaching the Bible, coupled with pastoral care being the complimentary need to this.“The issues that we face at Portrush Presbyterian Church, or ‘PPC’, are set against the context of the st century, a secular society, but a hungry society. In my time in PPC we have reflected the wider cultural trends, which I am glad to say have been away from ‘nominalism’ and traditional church attendance, to a more committed church community living in a community where outwardly church is less important, but certainly not without value.“Primarily we love to share the Good News in all ways we can, but we know we must earn trust and respect. In this, we see the location of PPC as critical to a very wide community of visitors and friends, helped by street gospel distributions and other opportunities as cultural moments in the town provide s for evangelism. As Moderator, I want to translate the le and experience of ministry in Portrush, both church and community, to a bigger canvas, but with the same vision and pattern,” he said.Mr Kirkpatrick also explained that building relationships with the community, and serving the community, were both important. “We see our presence as a gospel one, building relationships with all where we can people and organisations are part of this involvement from our local schools, to the PPC’s shop in the town that connects with community in a dferent way and funds ious community projects. We also encourage our members to be active in the community in ious ways through the RNLI and REACH, for example, a community project which took on a greater signicance due to Covid.”With regards to the pandemic, he said that while the lockdown was dficult for so many dferent reasons, it also created an opportunity to try new things. “We did recorded services and streaming services. I did a daily devotional called ‘Side-by-Side’ and a video reading of several appropriate books such as ‘The hiding place’ by Corrie ten Boom, ‘To a dferent drum’ by Pauline Hamilton, and Elizabeth Kuhn’s, ‘Green leaf in drought’ as I wanted to encourage our people in their isolation.”Married to Joan for  years this summer, a palliative care nurse, they have four children and five grandchildren. “Thursday was baking day in our home during the lockdown when Joan baked. The following day I was able to deliver to folk as part of my rounds, giving me a chance to listen to them and pray for them on the doorstep, or in their garden. We’ve made every effort to be in church and have le back when we were given the chance. Thankfully we have a big building, which has meant we could welcome everyone back safely.”Thinking about his forthcoming year in office, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “For everyone, the last two years have seen all aspects of le, and Church le with it, turned upside down and the story still isn’t over yet. As time moves on, I hope and pray that we will be able to process the many painful memories that it has left behind. I appreciate that this will not be an easy, or a straightforward journey for everyone, as our stories are all dferent.“With this in mind, as Moderator, I look forward to visiting congregations, ministers and their families, seeing what they have been through, how they have coped, and ministering into that. Stepping into my predecessor’s shoes after two years will not be easy, and I pay tribute to Dr Bruce as he has led the Church through this time of national and global crisis. Whatever the year may hold, I am thankful to God, that I won’t be undertaking it alone, and certainly not in my own strength, for Jesus will be with me!”When Mr Kirkpatrick is not in the pulpit, or visiting members of his congregation, he says that he enjoys walking, reading, watching films and listening to an eclectic mix of music.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle.

The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13435296.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I took up art, I did it for about a year and that was the end of that.“Then about five years ago, my sister’s husband had died and we were clearing out the house. I found that she’d kept all of the sketches I’d done when I was  in an envelope. “I started looked at them, messing around with them, I bought some paints and started colouring them in.Clubsound in the s. PACEMAKER PRESS BELFAST“The nights I wasn’t working I was painting. In two years I must have done about  paintings for people.“It’s a blessing for me, it kept me sane, when you play every week and suddenly you stop, it hits you hard.“It relieved the boredom, it gave me something to focus on, when a painting turned out successful you felt you’d achieved something.“My biggest satisfaction is that I’ve painted memories for people that are now hanging in their house.George Jones started and finished his radio career with Downtown. Picture by CHARLES MCQUILLAN PACEMAKER.“It’s another sense of entertainment I suppose, another string to my bow. If my sister hadn’t kept those sketches I wouldn’t have all of this.”George recalled his sister’s influence on his musical career: “The first two records my sister brought in that started me on music when I was about nine or  were Little Richard ‘Long Tall Sally’ and Elvis ‘All Shook Up’. “In those days it wasn’t vinyl, it was  bakelite – it looked the same as vinyl butyou’d dropped it, it would have smashed. “I listened to them non-stop and then she bought me my first guitar at .”George said he formed skfle groups with boys of his age in the Bloomfield area of east Belfast. One of them was Van Morrison, whom George went on to tour with as The Monarchs.He said: “I go to lunch with Van Morrison quite a lot. The Monarchs were the first band to go to Germany. We had a hit record in  when the Beatles were still hovering around Germany.“Van has been trying to find the rights to it to repress it and put it out as a single on vinyl. I sung on it and he played saxophone – a bit of rock and roll.”George, who has been part of the successful ‘Do You Come Here Often ’ and ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ shows, started learning the guitar at . He believes that might be the magic number: “I’ve interviewed so many people in my years on the radio who started the exact same way. “I’m hesitant to ask when they started to play the guitar – it’s always . So many great guitarists I interviewed, the likes of Hank B Marvin, started at .”Having found his first chords at  George is still going strong at .He said: “For me it’s been an incredible le, just when you think it’s all over, Clubsound have found a new lease of le.“We’ve found out that young people have started listening to the albums their parents have. I hesitate to use the term, but you become a cult.“Young ones come up to me and say ‘Yeoooo, Shankill Airways, my mum plays that all the time’.”George said the state modern music meant that people are yearning for songs from bygone days, especially the fties and sixties: “It was real music, there was no electronics – it was guitars, live drums, you were getting the whole live vibe.“In our day you just piled in, there was no such thing as tickets, you paid at the door and they squeezed in as many as they could.That added to the experience.”George plans to publish his memoirs as a book. In it he plans to recount his first meetings with Rory Gallagher and an incredibly green Gary Moore, of whom he told his father, ‘that wee lad will never be a guitar player’.‘It took a long time but I’m now over shock exit from Radio Ulster’George said that when he made his radio debut with Downtown his plan wasn’t to dilute his Clubsound persona too much.He said: “I used to bring what I did on stage onto the radio. I used to bring these we characters like Sadie that I did the voices for – she got more mail that I did. Radio needs to entertain,you’re on for two hours you’re not just sitting there spinning dics, you have to draw people in.”It wasn’t long before George was snapped up by Radio Ulster where he delivered ‘Just Jones’ for an amazing  years. Then one fateful day he was told he was surplus to requirements despite his popularity.George said: “People come up to me to this day, saying, ‘we miss you on the raido’ and ‘why did they do that to you’. “It was a big change in my le, it brought me down to earth more than anything. I thought those days were over – about two more times before that we were down and out and started over again, especially after the Miami thing and in South Africa my son nearly died of typhoid.“There were downs, but this was one I didn’t expect. I felt I was doing a good job.“During my six month notice period the public lted me to heights I never would believe. On the last week I was there I got nearly , emails from all over the world. I walked out of there about  feet tall. That was the bonus.”He said: “My we and family have helped me put it behind me. It took a long time because I was hurting.“I took up U with good success. It was water under the bridge and I had to put it under the bridge. I finished up in Downtown where I’d started in the s. Then I said to myself, radio is changing but it’s time for me to step aside.“When I look back now at radio in general, it’s like looking back to the wonder years of music, it saddens me – why has it changed so much  The commercial radio stations are just advertising boards with bits of music. “The word entertainment has disappeared from broadcasting. You couldn’t sit and listen to a radio show for two hours now, whereas before you’d have people would have been glad of that two hours of company.”Asked who he listens to on the ‘wireless’ George said: “Ken Bruce is still one of the old school and he makes me laugh. He still plays the oldies. Steve Wright still plays oldies. Asides from that it’s Classic FM.“It breaks my heart but I wouldn’t listen to any local radio stations.”Where to see George and Clubsound in actionClubsound’s current line-up of George Jones, David McKnight, Barry Woods, Alan McCartney and Jimmy Black will be on the road this spring including gigs at Theatre at The Mill in Newtownabbey on Saturday, March , Armagh’s Market Place Theatre on Saturday, April  and the Portico Arts and Heritage Centre in Portaferry on Monday, April .

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We first saw Sinn Fein Ministers refuse even the most basic of requests, whilst their Councillors are now blocking proposals to organise \"meaningful and respectful events\" marking the Jubilee.\"That Sinn Fein Councillors in Mid Ulster were joined by the SDLP further highlights a wider problem within nationalism. The respect and admiration for Her Majesty the Queen stretches far beyond the unionist community yet it is snubbed in favour of a narrow nationalistic vision.\"Many of the same Councillors who want to prevent allow others celebrating a major occasion that will marked worldwide were quite prepared to see £, of ratepayers money spent establishing a working group to promote discussion on the topic of a united Ireland.\"There is a complete lack of leadership on display from Sinn Fein.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas metercosts will increase by around pound per year to pound,. The Ten TownsareaincludesAntrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon ,Limavady,Derry-Londonderry, Newry and more than other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “The Utility Regulator forewarned us that energy price rises of this nature will continue because of exceptionally high global wholesale gas prices, however it is never good news for consumers when prices go up. This is going to put extreme pressure on many households as they try to pay their gas bills. “With the cost of energy continuing to increase, the Consumer Council is concerned about a potential rise in fuel poverty as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “We welcome firmus energy’s commitment to assist some of our most vulnerable consumers through support for the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, but it is clear that energy companies including firmus, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high fuel prices will be with us for years.” Consumers who are struggling with their energy bills or topping up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk. The Consumer Council’s websitehas a number of free resources includingSwitch On: A Guide for Home Energy Users,which helps consumers be more energy efficient at home, get the best from their electricity or gas supply, and save money. firmus energy customers in Greater Belfast and in the gas to the West network area will not be impacted by this tarf change.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abfcdfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cabcedaecb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
