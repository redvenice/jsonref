And 59 per cent said they agreed with Boris Johnson\u0027s criticism of the BBC for \u0027cringing with embarrassment over our history\u0027.The two planned new services are both expected to be more \u0027news-talk\u0027 shows than the traditional rolling news services that are provided by BBC News and Sky News. One of the companies, GB News, which has already secured an Ofcom licence, is backed by investors from the US and the UK. It has been in talks with American media giant Discovery.It is understood that GB News has been in discussions with Mr Neil about joining up, with sources suggesting it would be similar to a TV version of the LBC radio station.According to an insider it will aim to sit in the centre of the political spectrum but be less Left-wing and less woke than the BBC. The insider said: \u0027Just by taking a centrist line it will seem more to the Right because the others are so much to the Left.\u0027 Sources say News UK, the publisher of The Sun and The Times, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has also been developing plans to launch a news channel. Discussion are at an advanced level.Earlier this year David Rhodes, former president of CBS News in the US, was brought in to News UK. It is understood he joined to launch a news channel.There are said to be high-level discussions about what form the service will take. Mr Rhodes also worked as a senior executive at Fox News, which is on the Right of American politics and is famous for its strident take on the news. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bravery medal hero British Army dog took Al Qaeda sniper","story":"Share this article He had already conducted 16 operations over a five-month period when he was injured.Kuno required several operations before he could be flown home on an RAF plane for reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, receiving in-flight care from a Royal Army Veterinary Corps team.Back in the UK he was transferred to the Defence Animal Training Regiment in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, where he underwent further extensive surgery.The surgery was overseen by Dick White, one of the world\u0027s leading specialists in canine surgery and special professor of small animal surgery at the University of Nottingham.Kuno then embarked upon a lengthy programme of rehabilitation to restore function to his nerves and muscles – just as any other injured service personnel would.

They pose a new challenge to the brand’s insistence that issues reported in July were simply evidence of “the actions of a few” and stood in contrast to “the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area”.Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, where many of the factories are based, said the allegations suggested “an unforgivable breakdown of our basic social contract” and called on Boohoo to urgently release a full list of its suppliers in the city.Boohoo said the documentation seen by the  “appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed”. But it added that its own investigations “have highlighted similar issues” in some of the manufacturers identified by the  and that it had suspended trading with them until its concerns were resolved.Claims in the documents, which were described by one expert as “a smoking gun” on Boohoo and other brands’ oversight of minimum wage issues, detail allegations of:The reports, which date from 2017 to just a few months ago, came alongside whistleblower claims of other violations in Leicester’s factories. Industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they had seen dozens more that raised similar concerns at other Boohoo suppliers.There is no suggestion that Boohoo had access to the reports, which were circulated to some factory managers and other brands. The company, which has been accused in the past of turning a blind eye to issues in its supply chain, has its own oversight process for factories in Leicester.On its own investigations, Boohoo said: “Due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers … we have immediately suspended orders with a number of suppliers whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the .”It added that it was “deeply concerned by these findings” but said that until its own investigations and an independent QC-led review were complete “it would be inappropriate for us to comment further”. The brand did not clarify which of the factories it had suspended.Eight of the 18 companies denied some or all of the claims set out in the audits, with some calling them historical or saying they did not represent typical standards. The other 10 did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Audit reports are a central part of how fashion brands assess working practices in factories before deciding whether to place orders. But while they may be circulated within the industry, until now the reports have not been released publicly, even when they raise concerns over possible minimum-wage violations.“We have long known these reports exist, but brands never release them,” said Nik Hammer, an associate professor in employment studies at the University of Leicester and author of a 2015 report on the city’s textiles industry.The reports came alongside separate claims from one worker at Pro Fashion Limited, a subcontractor making clothes for Boohoo and its sister brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal. The worker showed the  a recent “official” payslip. It showed them earning the £8.72 legal minimum wage. Separately, the worker had what they described as a “shadow” payslip which was handwritten and they said showed many hours more had been worked. That suggested the real rate was just £6 an hour.Concerns over the company’s supply chain have been raised repeatedly over the years by campaign groups, the media and MPs, including the Conservative Andrew Bridgen in a speech to parliament earlier this year. But the brand and the government have until recently largely ignored calls for reform.The scrutiny intensified again this summer after the  revealed claims that Leicester textile firms had breached lockdown measures, and the Sunday Times reported that one Boohoo supplier had offered an undercover reporter £3.50 an hour.The Manchester-based brand had £1.5bn wiped off its share price in two days in July amid growing investor concern over practices within its supply chain. When the lockdown claims first emerged, Boohoo said they were inaccurate and that it “categorically does not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance … with our strict code of conduct”.With investors deserting the firm, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding the company do more to protect workers in its supply chain, it announced plans to set up a “model factory” in Leicester where workers would be treated fairly, and set up an independent review. It also said it would increase an inspection programme led by the third-party auditor Verisio.But critics say the whistleblower accounts and reports seen by the  provide a worrying snapshot of the problems within the industry, particularly over alleged minimum-wage violations. At Onyx Fashion, a Boohoo supplier, one audit claimed managers admitted full-time workers were being falsely recorded as working part-time hours – an allegation the company “vehemently denied”.A 2018 report on Ezili Dariyai, which mainly produced leisurewear, said timesheets were not signed by workers and minimum-wage payments could not be verified. The company then went into liquidation, owing more than £600,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, causing Mahomed Hanif Musa Patel to be struck off as a director. He did not respond to requests for comment.Another firm, Bux Clothing, was accused in a 2017 audit of failing to keep proper records of working hours, making it impossible to verify the payment of minimum wage. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.On 8 July, we announced an independent review of our UK supply chain in Leicester. This two-part approach\u0026nbspsaw us invest heavily in significant extra compliance and auditing resource to forensically investigate the allegations that had been made about mistreatment of people employed by garment manufacturers in the area. We also appointed senior barrister Alison Levitt QC to lead a comprehensive and fully independent review of our Leicester supply chain, which has included a public call for evidence.\u0026nbspThe documentation that has been seen by the  appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed. Whilst we are deeply concerned by these findings, until these processes are concluded, we have had sight of all the facts and received Ms Levitt’s findings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency, and we have committed to sharing an update on the findings of Ms Levitt’s review, our response, and the actions that we will take to address any failings at the end of September.\u0026nbspWe will continue to offer our full support to raise standards where appropriate for the benefit of those employed in our supply chain, but will not hesitate to take more severe action when necessary. We can confirm that due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers during this process we have immediately suspended trading with them whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified within the timeline we have set. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the , as our own investigations have highlighted similar issues.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe feel that it is important to give owners the opportunity to show demonstrable, measurable and significant improvement to protect the jobs of those employed, but if we are left in any doubt about an owner’s true commitment to drive change in the timeframe that we have set out we will have no choice but to terminate trading with them.\u0026nbspWe recognise that walking away from every factory where an issue is found would have a catastrophic impact on the livelihoods of those employed in the sector. Instead, we are working closely with a number of organisations, including the GLAA and Slave Free Alliance, sharing our findings with them to support the important work that they do in ensuring that the rights of workers are protected and that everyone is treated fairly and paid appropriately.Bux Clothing is one of five textile firms in Leicester to separately be issued with improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over hygiene and social distancing measures since the city’s second lockdown, alongside I Design Leicester, Clothing Pallet, VR Mode Limited and Smart Garments. All five complied with the notices.As well as Bux, the  has established through worker interviews that Smart Garments is also a Boohoo supplier.Smart Garments did not dispute the HSE’s findings that it “failed to put reasonably practicable control measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19” but said the body was “satisfied with our risk assessment and how we managed the factory in the current Covid environment”. Boohoo did not comment on the improvement notices.Dominique Muller, whose report on Leicester factories in lockdown for the campaign group Labour Behind the Label prompted the recent Boohoo storm, claimed the range of the audits showed that “the idea that this could go on without Boohoo’s knowledge or tacit acceptance, it’s a complete fallacy. They hold the power in Leicester, and it’s disingenuous to pretend anything else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c97d6ca89def0e66fa1876c2048ce6566443b546/0_386_6250_3749/master/6250.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c2693fc6dbc2e226c1290ebb3a2590d7","title":"pebble pods and bubble domes six amazing places to wake up in northern ireland","story":"From quirky glampsites to boutique hotels with amazing views, discover the most enticing places to stay in Northern IrelandPebble Pods, Strangford, County DownA relatively new entry to the Northern Ireland glamping scene, but one of the most remarkable, this private location on the shores of Strangford Lough takes pod camping to a new level – and with only three two-person pods, you’ll never find it overcrowded.The glass-and-timber Pebble Pods resemble Hobbit holes, and have a host of amenities, but let’s focus on the most important: a private hot tub, thermal sauna, firepit and barbecue area, providing for year-round luxuriating by the cool waters of one of NI’s most gorgeous loughs.If you’re an active person, there are free bikes and even kayaks to help you explore the area. If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests.

Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away?

My generation has shown itself to be robust and ready to make changeThe night that the schools closed we lit a fire in a field and danced like it was the end of the world, dizzy on diet lemonade and vodka.I had had two days to say goodbye to the people I had seen five days a week for seven years – people I had grown up with, people who had shaped me. For two years I had seen my life as “the time before exams” and “the time after”, so now I had to work out what to do when suddenly the structure in my life had been taken away, when the destination I had been running towards suddenly disappeared.Under lockdown, I feared that I wasn’t doing enough reading or writing, or anything. Would a future Cambridge student just sit and watch Netflix all day? Isolation taught me how much of myself was simply an extension of my friends, and how that was a great thing. It taught me about how much I loved them and needed them in my life. At a time when I wanted to tell them this, when I wanted to touch them and cling to them, I couldn’t.Before lockdown, my mam worked full time, and I would be at school till late. We were “like two ships in the night”, she used to say. We then became two little rubber dinghies tied together and bobbing along. It was a big change, seeing each other all the time. We are so similar it was like an experiment into what it would be like to live with myself.I was raised primarily by my mam, gran and sister, and I would not have it any other way. I think single mother and daughter relationships distinguish themselves from other familial relationships. For me, there is something beautiful and completely natural about the shared energy. When we argue, we have the force of two volcanoes erupting at the same time. Our relationship has changed, in that I have started to see her not just as a mother but as another woman. As a friend.I wrote a journal every night from 20 March through to 14 June. At the time it felt like a useful coping method, and it was for a while, until it turned into more of a compulsion. Looking back at it, it reads like something from a post–apocalyptic movie, each entry starting with “day x of lockdown”. Some days I wrote pages and pages, writing about how I felt, questioning who I would be when this ended. Other days the entries were sad and short: “a nothing day”, the term that came to represent the days I could not leave my bed.Then there were the moments of much wider significance: Boris Johnson catching coronavirus, Dominic Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle, the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed. All of these large events are woven in alongside seemingly more mundane teenage things – missing my friends and my social life. A recurring character in my journal is results day. I think I began to see that as The End. My ramblings almost describe 13 August as a finishing line.I was never confident about how the results would be handled – how was I supposed to feel safe with my future in the hands of a government run by a party that had systematically underfunded my childhood? As 13 August got closer, and more information became available about how results would be awarded, I felt more and more detached.After Scotland’s results day, which resembled a postcode lottery, my friends and I stopped describing our forthcoming results as something we had earned and instead as something we had been given. To the government and Ofqual, we were not iniduals but statistics. It came as no surprise to us that private schools had done better under the algorithm that was used. The confusing morning of 13 August was spent mostly comparing the grades our teachers had given us with Ofqual’s. I was fortunate in that I came from a state school with a history of good results – others were not so lucky. In the end, the government was forced to U-turn.We are the generation who are about to venture into adulthood during the biggest recession in this country’s history. The generation who will try to be young and carefree during a global pandemic, clutching grades awarded for exams we did not sit. But when I see the headlines telling me my generation is cursed or ruined – that our mental health is on the decline and the future is horrific – I will remember these curious months when time slowed down.The road trips. The walks through the park, light breaking through the leaves. The marches through town, placards in hand, demanding a fairer world. The cold, early-morning trips to the sea to watch the sunrise. My generation has shown itself to be resilient, robust and ready to make change. And that, in itself, is enough.• Sarah Mulgrew will be a first-year undergraduate at Cambridge University in October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04316ac76c75761fe47c26d4923242496fbf3712/0_122_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dea2eadfc4187ec151dbd3262dec0045","title":"on my radar larry achiampongs cultural highlights","story":"The artist on the soulful sounds of Khruangbin, Damon Lindelof’s powerful Watchmen adaptation and the joy of rediscovering skatingMultidisciplinary artist Larry Achiampong was born in 1984 and grew up in Bethnal Green and Dagenham, east London, in Ghanaian households. He received his MA in sculpture from the Slade School of Art in 2008. His work, which mainly looks at pop culture, class and colonialism, has been shown at Tate Modern and Somerset House in London, the 57th Venice Biennale and the Institute for Creative Arts in Cape Town. His most recent exhibition was When the Sky Falls at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton and his latest work, Sanko-time, is part of The Line, London’s free art walk. It’s an audio piece that accompanies the cable-car ride from Greenwich Peninsula to the Royal Docks. It can also be heard anywhere in the world at the-line.org.Mordechai by KhruangbinI passed my driving test in January and, as I’m based in Essex, I’ve been going to London to check on my mum. I’ve been listening to albums in the car and Khruangbin’s Mordechai is so special. It brings musical flavours from around the planet and it feels like this Texas-based trio really studied their craft. Some artists have an interest in a certain culture and it can feel derivative, but Khruangbin have created a psychedelic, soulful mix of sounds. The drummer, Donald Johnson, has got such an effortless flow it actually reminds me of Tony Allen. I don’t think the hole that Allen has left will ever be filled, but in the meantime it’s nice to have Johnson’s drums for company.I was a fan of Alan Moore’s Watchmen comic and even the Zack Snyder film was OK. But what writer Damon Lindelof and actors Regina King and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II created with this series filled the holes that I felt were in the comics. It concerned me that the conversations around race and gender in the original comics weren’t as important as they could have been. This show opened things up in a way I was completely surprised by. I must watch it again: it’s like a deep book where you pick up on symbolism and have to reread. The Tulsa massacre in the first episode was so powerfully written and shot. The way they looked at the diasporic American perspective… it was incredible.This is a third-person shooter team game. Your avatar morphs between human and squid and they have weapons but the guns are full of ink. Third-person shooters are usually violent but this isn’t. If your character is splatted, it just explodes into ink. I’ve been playing this for years and I’m still really into it. It nails aspects of popular culture such as mods and skinheads, and it’s an energetic and social game. I’ve played it a lot with my son and I’ve made friends playing it online.Purfleet and Rainham MarshesI spent some of my childhood in Dagenham and then moved out to Purfleet-on-Thames from London in February. The nature and quiet in Rainham Marshes is incredible and Purfleet is also very interesting. It’s maritime, but not like I’ve known before. It’s very industrial. There are derelict areas in the docks that have rusted away, but they’ve beautifully rusted away. I’ve sat out and spent time there this summer and I’m looking forward to seeing how it changes with the seasons. It’s been nice to be able to walk around and have contemplative moments.I grew up skating with hand-me-down and secondhand skates. But I recently bought myself some new quad skates. I haven’t skated for 25 or so years and it’s strange rekindling those muscle memories. I thought they were gone, but not at all. To be outside, especially in the heat and when there aren’t many people about, has been so special. Skating was the thing I loved as much as drawing when I was a kid. That has become my job and, for a while in a naive way, I used to dream about competing at the X Games. It didn’t happen but it’s nice to find that energy again as an adult."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

Should all children and staff be required to wear masks, or only some age groups? Should children be tested for the virus? How should social distancing be managed in the classroom and playground? And finally, should schools be reopening at all?With a recent sharp resurgence in virus cases, France has issued some of the most detailed guidelines for when schools reopen. Children in secondary schools will have to wear face coverings at all times when in school and in the playground, the education minister said on Thursday, as France reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases since the easing of restrictions.This is a change from recommendations in July that face coverings for older children would only be necessary where 1-metre social distancing could not be managed, and is a response to concerns from teaching unions about rising infections as the summer has gone on.While there were class size restrictions when French schools first reopened, in the new term there will be no size limits and the 1-metre social rule is advised but is not mandatory.Poland plans to reopen schools next week for the first time since mid-March despite reaching a record high number of daily registered coronavirus infections late last week.It has said it will not mandate mask wearing for children in the classroom. However, it has said inidual principals can decide to impose face coverings in school halls and locker rooms. Unlike in some other countries, no temperature checks at the school gates will be introduced.With one of the world’s highest per capita death rates from Covid-19 during the pandemic, Belgium has looked closely at the issue of masks in the classroom. When schools reopen on 1 September all children aged 12 and above and teachers will be required to wear masks, following an announcement by the prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, last week.“The goal is to avoid a second wave,” she told a news conference. “We see today that the situation is stabilising and improving. It is very important that children go to school.”Germany has drawn attention in recent days because of the experience of Berlin where, after reopening in the last fortnight, several dozen schools have had to close because of infections.Officials say most infections in Berlin involve only one teacher or student, and suggest that the transmission occurred outside the school.Berlin has responded by closing schools for very brief periods to allow contact tracing. “So far, these are isolated cases and not outbreaks,” Valerie Kirchberger, a paediatrician and coordinator of Berlin’s testing strategy, led by Charité hospital, told local media.Unlike in countries where education is organised on a national level, German schools are run regionally. While some German states have made face coverings mandatory at all times in schools, in others they are compulsory only in hallways and playgrounds. More generally, schools across the country have tried to manage the risk of infection by keeping classes separate.Regarded as one of the world’s most intensive education systems, South Korea struggled with reopening, delaying restarting schools multiple times and then phasing in different age groups.While a resurgence of infections in the country forced schools to close again, they have resorted to numerous tactics to keep operating, including attendance on alternate days and temperature checks.One of the first western countries to reopen its schools, in April, Denmark separated younger children into “micro-groups” of 12 known as “protective bubbles”.With school starting times staggered and desks 2 metres apart, masks were not deemed necessary. However, Denmark had relatively low infection numbers in the wider population, the result of quick and effective early suppression of the kind advocated by the British public health expert Devi Sridhar, who has emphasised that suppressing community transmission is ultimately what will make schools safe.As of 18 May, children aged 12-16 had returned to secondary schools following similar rules.Israel has emerged as one of the major cautionary tales. Having managed its initial outbreak relatively successfully, it reopened its schools in May, initially sending a limited number of classes children back in small “capsules” to minimise the risk of transmission. In a surprise move, however, the government then announced that all grades could return and lifted restrictions on class sizes.The reopening contributed to a resurgence of the virus, with tens of thousands of pupils later sent into quarantine as their classmates tested positive.Underlining the differing considerations in different parts of the world, Kenya’s schools will not reopen until at least January. As David Lagakos and Emilie Yam wrote in a piece for the World Economic Forum’s website, “low-income countries face a very different set of circumstances from high-income countries – for example, a higher proportion of households that include both children and elderly people … and the urgency of maintaining the livelihoods of working-age adults to prevent hunger and poverty.”With a school year running from January to November, officials have relied on the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to run school programmes via the radio, TV and internet since students stopped going to classes in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/894e3be67c174d9a38c0fcfaec0696a129fe6796/0_43_3114_1868/master/3114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c2b6e8d65f1f9361fb6419771d085","title":"the best tech for students from laptops to note taking tools","story":"Having the right equipment is more important than ever this year. Here’s how to chooseIt’s that time of year again when students are gearing up to go to university. But this time, it’s under very different circumstances – which makes having the right equipment even more important.From laptops and phones to headphones and note-taking tools, here’s a guide to some of the tech that might help improve your student experience … without breaking the bank.Given that a lot of teaching and learning will probably be done online over the coming months, it is arguably worth spending a bit more than you might normally.Look for the latest 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7 processors, at least 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or more of SSD storage. Don’t be tempted to buy a laptop with a traditional magnetic hard drive. They may be cheap and come with a fair bit of storage, but they’ll be slow.Screen size is up to you – smaller is better for carrying around, larger better if it’s fixed to a desk. I recommend a 13-inch to 14-inch screen as a happy medium. Make sure it’s at least 1080p resolution.Generally, you can get a good Windows 10 laptop for about £500. Be aware that at this price you will sacrifice typing and mousing experience, speaker and webcam quality, and probably battery life, too. Of the traditional laptops on offer for £499 or so, the Asus X409JA or Acer Aspire 5 are worth looking at.But if you want something a bit more flexible, the 10.5-inch Microsoft Surface Go 2 Windows 10 tablet costs around £479 with a keyboard with student discount.The good news is that you don’t have to spend £1,000 to get a really great one.For budgets under £450, the Google Pixel 4a is one of the best phones of the year at £349, with a top camera and great software including the excellent auto-transcribing Google Recorder app.If you want 5G, the OnePlus Nord, at about £379, is a true bargain, with a good camera and great performance, battery life and screen.Alternatively, Apple’s cracking iPhone SE 2020 at £419 is equally excellent value. It doesn’t have 5G or a better camera, but it has better performance and will last up to five years with software updates, whereas the others will last about three.For budgets up to £800, the £799 OnePlus 8 Pro is arguably the best Android phone released this year, and the £729 iPhone 11 gets you Face ID, a better screen and camera, and longer battery life than the SE.They can make a huge difference when it comes to being able to concentrate in a busy library, cafe or student house.For on-the-go listening, choose true wireless earbuds. Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are small, super-comfortable, block out noise, work with Android, iPhone, Mac and Windows, and last a long time on a charge with an excellent case. Available for as little as £105.Apple’s AirPods are great, too, but they do not block out noise, relying instead on simply drowning it out. Excellent for calls and can be had for around £125, or free with a Mac or iPad for students.If concentration is your key need, noise-cancelling headphones are essential. My top pick are the older Bose QuietComfort 35 II, excellent at both active and passive noise blocking, isolating you from speech better than most rivals. They are also extremely comfortable and durable. At around £220, they still undercut some top-priced competition.For taking notes you can access anywhere and for free on any device, I’m a long-time fan of Evernote and Microsoft’s OneNote.Both sync to the cloud, can handle text, images, handwriting, drawing and attachments to notes, including audio recordings – excellent for lectures – and have apps on the web, Android, iOS, MacOS and Windows.Evernote Basic is free to use on two devices with a 60MB per month upload limit for notes, which is fine for just text and the odd photo.Evernote Premium costs £4.99 a month with up to 10GB of uploads per month, unlimited devices and notes up to 200MB in size. Students get Evernote Premium for half price when bought yearly.OneNote is free to use, but notes are stored in OneDrive, which comes free with a Microsoft account with 5GB of space. More OneDrive storage costs £1.99 a month for 100GB of space, or it can be bought with a Microsoft 365 account starting at £59.99, which includes 1TB of storage as well as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook apps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe013e5933588534d19df7824a75c88bb9ba791/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af83244086c094162793602ba580ebda","title":"weary teachers frustrated by late guidance on reopening english schools covid 19","story":"Schools reopen next week and rules on rotas in case of local Covid-19 outbreaks were published on FridayTeaching unions have expressed their frustration at the introduction of last-minute guidance on the reopening of secondary schools in England, which says schools in local lockdown areas should introduce a rota system to limit attendance and compulsory face masks in communal areas.The guidance, issued on Friday ahead of English schools reopening for the start of the new academic year next week, is intended to limit the amount of contact between staff and students in schools, and provide enough time at home for symptoms to become apparent.Initially, the new guidance had said that if a single case of coronavirus was confirmed, every pupil in the affected person’s year group or “bubble” might have to quarantine for two weeks. However, this passage was removed by the Department for Education shortly after publication on Friday night.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the changes to school attendance were an “absolute last resort”, and only for a “worst-case scenario”.“We hope that we won’t have to implement the guidance set out today,” he said.However, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the timing of the introduction of the new guidance was “unfair” to headteachers and school leaders.“Heads are going to feel under a lot of pressure now, over this weekend, to start looking at these, thinking about how they will implement them in their schools, whether they will have to make any changes to arrangements they’ve already put in place.”Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, where some boroughs are still under local lockdown restrictions, said the guidance was “fairly clear, but it was very late”.“It came out at 7.30pm on the Friday before a bank holiday,” he told BBC Breakfast. “Why is the government doing this again, putting out guidance so late so that headteachers don’t have time to prepare?”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that school leaders felt a “weary, resigned sense of inevitability” at the timing of the new guidelines.Asked how teachers would feel about the situation, he said: “Here we are again, right at the last minute with something that we have been accused of expressing treachery in asking for – where’s the plan B in case of local lockdown – at last it has arrived.”Echoing this, Paul Whiteman, the leader of the NAHT union, said headteachers had been asking for a contingency plan for what would happen in the case of an outbreak for weeks.He described the timing of the guidance as “reprehensible”.“It was obvious weeks ago that lockdown advice was necessary,” he said. “The government’s decision to publish this at 9pm on the Friday of the bank holiday weekend before most schools are due to return is nothing short of reprehensible and demonstrates a complete lack of regard for the wellbeing of school leaders and their teams.“Keeping schools open has to be the priority, but you don’t need a crystal ball to see that there will almost inevitably be some disruption in some areas in the coming weeks,” he added, saying that “another late-night publication is fairly typical of what we’ve become used to”.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the advice should have been available “months ago”.She said: “It is simply unacceptable that this guidance was altered immediately on what is a key issue for schools – what to do when pupils are found to have Covid. As it stands currently there is still no clarity on what should happen in a school where there is an outbreak. This does not build confidence in government’s competence to keep schools safe when it scores such an own goal.” Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, the Teachers’ Union, was the latest union official to criticise the last minute announcement.“We have been saying for some time that schools need clarity on these important issues and that it is the responsibility of the government to provide that clarity,” he said.Roach also called on the government to provide extra funding for schools to employ surplus staff in the case that schools were affected by local lockdown measures, saying there needed to be greater recognition of the impact of local restrictions on teachers and staff.“The availability of staff where there is a local lockdown or outbreak may mean that schools have to limit provision if they cannot be staffed safely,” he said. “The government now needs to confirm that schools will have the additional resources they need to deliver an effective remote learning offer to all pupils as well as funding for additional staff that will be necessary to maintain continuity of provision in the event of local disruption.”Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee, acknowledged that the late-hour release of the guidance was “incredibly difficult” for teachers.While Halfon said he did not know why the government decided to release the information so close to the reopening of schools, he said it was “better that it’s there”. Asked about the removal of a paragraph shortly after the guidance was released, Halfon said: “Clearly these things shouldn’t happen and mistakes obviously have been made, and been rectified, but the important thing is that the guidance is right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b092405a50fbd75e36f509442af67d52732bc3/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d1ee937c8d4996fc92a5ef8c5ff71569 2020w","title":"chadwick boseman the unbearable loss of a prince of american cinema","story":"What a terrible blow to lose a young actor of so much promise – the poignancy of his death made all the more acute by its echo in Spike Lee’s recent Da 5 BloodsHis beauty, his grace, his style, his presence and — until what stunned admirers must now understand to have been the very end — his youthful, boyish openness. These made up Chadwick Boseman’s persona an actor who had come to be loved among many things for his lightly worn imperiousness, humour and charm as T’Challa, king of the fictional African country Wakanda in the Marvel smash Black Panther. Like many actors who play kings and princes in hugely successful movies or TV shows, the regality rubs off, the royalty is a residue, but he had these things anyway.What makes his death so shocking for me is that I had so loved his performance in Spike Lee’s new film Da 5 Bloods, playing the squad leader Norman, who was killed in action in Vietnam, 50 years before four of the men under his command (played by Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr and Norm Lewis) now come back to present-day Vietnam on a fraught journey into their own pasts. Lee brilliantly recreates flashback jungle scenes for all five, but with the four middleaged as they are now, and Chadwick Boseman’s Norman as he was then, as he was in their memory. He has grown not old as those that are left have grown old: he is still the impossibly handsome and daring young leader who has the tragic military burden of persuading his men not to mutiny because of the racism of the top brass.This superbly conceived performance now assumes an almost unbearable, real poignancy: when I see the poster image of these men taking a knee at Norman’s graveside it is overwhemingly sad. We now know that Boseman was being treated for cancer, and must already have been aware of the possibility that his end was near.It had been Boseman’s destiny, also, to dramatise other African-American icons on his way to becoming an icon himself: in 42, he was legendary Jackie Robinson, the first black American to make it into baseball’s major league.This was a film which notably chose a simpler, inspirational theme over anything more complex and politically contentious, but Boseman’s performance was what supplied the complexity and texture in itself: seductive and determined, intent on surpassing his own loneliness and the prejudice of others. His Robinson was a figure shown being beset by bigotry on all sides, even by some on his own team, but toughing it out without self-pity. Already, he was assuming a kind of superheroism.In Marshall, he played Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice of the United States, appointed to the bench by JFK, who made important rulings against segregation. The movie dramatises an early courtroom drama, when his Marshall had to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman, and Boseman let rip with gorgeous and extravagant theatrics as the brilliant young advocate.Something of the same physicality and athleticism — and also sexuality — went into his portrayal of James Brown in the flawed biopic Get On Up, which, though it could not quite get to grips with the more unwelcome side of its leading character, had another exquisitely fierce turn from Boseman.In 21 Bridges, he had a more conventional, generic role as a New York cop who in time-honoured style had lost his dad to criminals, and now has to solve a violent gangland crime on Manhattan which he does by ordering all twenty-one bridges connecting the island to the mainland to be closed to cut off the culprit’s means of escape — an interestingly regal move.But of course it was as T’Challa, the gloriously charismatic superhero of colour in Marvel’s afrofuturist adventure, that Boseman imposed his personality on the movies. He was sensitive, handsome and stylish with something introspective, vulnerable and self-questioning in his manner as he assumes the surreal throne. Boseman did it all with such grace that it is an incidental pain for his fans that he never got to reapply these acting gifts on playing Shakespeare on stage or screen.Like all celebrities and movie stars, Boseman was entitled to his privacy, even though through his sheer empathy and lovability, his fans had come to think that they were already part of that privacy, that they knew him. So the news that he also had cancer is such a shock. He seemed — he was — so young, always appearing at least a decade younger than his years. His great movie roles were quintessentially about youth, about the vigour and energy and idealism and having it all in front of you. Boseman now becomes the lost prince of American cinema, who had a glorious and inspirational career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f965848a42d98e639ba78184161fbcb8a13242/0_621_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8d0a19c77d917b195138533c64572ad","title":"our superhero black british figures praise chadwick boseman","story":"Tributes to groundbreaking star come from spheres of film, TV, sport and politicsChadwick Boseman has been widely praised for breaking down cultural boundaries and inspiring a generation of young black people, following news of his untimely death.The Black Panther star died at his home in the Los Angeles area aged 43, four years after being diagnosed with colon cancer. He was best known for his role as the regal T’Challa in the Marvel cinematic universe, the franchise’s first high-profile black superhero.Black Panther was considered a cultural milestone as the first mega-budget movie to have an African-American director and a predominantly black cast.Released at the height of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, which campaigned against the overlooking of black talent at the Academy Awards, the film defied racist opposition to become first superhero movie to be nominated for a best picture Oscar and one of the highest-grossing films of all time. The Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton dedicated his pole position at the Belgian Grand Prix to Boseman on Saturday afternoon.Sharing a picture of himself doing the Wakanda salute from Black Panther, he said: “What he accomplished and the legacy he left is so incredible to me. He’s inspired a whole generation of young black men and women … Rest in power my friend.” Hamilton earlier described Boseman as “our superhero”.“I’m so grateful I got to meet you brother,” he tweeted. “Thank you for all you have done for us. Rest in Power, you were the best of us and will never be forgotten. Love, light and prayers I send to you and your family.”The ITV news anchor Charlene White said Boseman had made “little black kids believe that anything is possible” and thanked him for inspiring a generation. “You just never know what burden someone else is carrying, what battle they may be fighting. This really shocked me,” she said.Boseman made his name in biopics exploring the lives of prominent black Americans, launching his career with his portrayal of the baseball player Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League baseball in the modern era. He went on to play icons including James Brown and the civil rights lawyer Thurgood Marshall.  Fellow actor Idris Elba posted on Instagram “Rest in peace Brother Chadwick. I’m saddened by this loss. Chadwick was a very thoughtful, hardworking man. Prideful and strong. He will be missed by the filmmaking community and fans of his solid work. My thoughts reach out to his family right now.”The Noughts and Crosses author Malorie Blackman referenced Boseman’s groundbreaking role as King T’Challa: “Thank you for all the amazing films and good works. And thank you for Black Panther, which made the adult me smile and the child in me rejoice because - at last. Rest in eternal peace and power.”The Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, said the news of Boseman’s death was devastating. “How very sad. Wonderful talent. Taken way too soon. What a trooper for continuing despite it all,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f9052808b3600503e33763a14d057f0b5bcb58/356_99_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40f309c1ac69f6530ecb16971dcef8b","title":"chadwick boseman a life in pictures","story":"The US actor best known for his role as T’Challa in Black Panther, has died at the age of 43.

Although City sat atop of the league when it was curtailed and decided on points per game, Chelsea were only one point behind with a game in hand and were awarded the title.Rust-caked aspects of both teams’ games this time after six months without a competitive game, but the quality was always clear. Early on, Manchester City were vulnerable on the break and impotent in possession, but as Jill Scott and Caroline Weir began to enjoy more of the ball in midfield, their new signing Chloe Kelly flourished. She was the best player on the pitch in the first half, a debut performance marked by humiliating three Chelsea defenders in an astonishing run down the left. Later, her cool, low strike rebounded off a post.But much of the game was the story of the Australian superstar Sam Kerr, who continually made the right runs and put herself in the perfect position in front of goal, but each time she could not finish. Her failure to convert a simple one-on-one three minutes into the game set the tone as she simply could not score throughout.On Kerr’s sixth missed opportunity of the afternoon, the game transformed as Scott slid into Ji So-yun during the buildup and was eventually handed her second yellow card. Chelsea’s shining attack, driven by Ji, Guro Reiten and Fran Kirby, who had not played since November after being diagnosed with pericarditis, jubilantly danced around the final third.In the end, the deadlock was broken in a most unexpected scenario as Bright picked up the ball far outside the penalty area after another attack, took one touch and then belted it into the top corner. Chelsea controlled the rest of the game, eventually killing it off after a rebounded cross rolled into the path of Erin Cuthbert, who buried her strike to seal the victory.And so a new season begins as the last one ended: with Chelsea pipping Manchester City to another trophy. Afterwards, the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, paid tribute to the long process that has culminated in Chelsea rising to the stratosphere as the dominant team in women’s football: “You have to remember, I’ve been here nine years. This hasn’t just happened,” she said. “This has taken some time to build and I am so lucky to have been given the trust by the club to build the players that have stuck with me in this process.”It marks Hayes’s eighth trophy in her nine years and a third this year after winning the WSL and the FA Women’s League Cup. The rescheduled FA Cup quarter-finals will also be decided in the near future, along with five more trophies to compete for. There will be so many more tussles to come.“Regardless of the opponent, it’s a trophy and I wanted to win that trophy,” said Hayes. “The players know that I wanted to win it. I think City have a clear recruitment plan so that, by the time we play them the next time, their team will be even stronger than it was today. So, we can’t get carried away. We won today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42d46630007eb27de78135dc40992523c5b7b89a/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5553f22f6765e678cf2058c78893a4","title":"lava touches and teal accents the premier league 2020 21 kits","story":"Who is offering ‘a touch of Savile Row’ and who is promising ‘glory pink’? A lowdown on the jerseys released for next seasonIt may seem only five minutes ago that Jordan Henderson lifted the Premier League trophy in an empty Anfield, but it’s only a fortnight before the new season kicks off on 12 September and kit manufactures have wasted no time designing egregiously priced holes in punters’ pockets. Still, new kits are one of the best flavours of anticipation to a season and, despite all the changes to football in current times, this is one thing that remains the same.Here, we take a look at all the new strips released: home and away goalkeeper and third dull and interesting ugly and beautiful.Arsenal’s new kit, worn above by the triumphant Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – just before he dropped the FA Cup – is a classy, round-collared affair. It is a darker, deeper red than previous iterations, almost burgundy, with a zig-zag pattern. The goalkeeper kit is an extremely goth metal black. The away kit is yet to be confirmed but going by the poor staffer who uploaded it to Asos pre-embargo (as well as a blue third kit), it looks as though it will be a white and red marble effect. The marble is meant to be a hat tip to the hallowed halls of Highbury, but has been compared to raspberry ripple ice cream and blood splatter, which is unfortunate. We are, meanwhile, still urged to Visit Rwanda.Aston Villa’s new home strip isn’t much to write, er, home about. The barely-there pinstripes are nice but a design element associated with barristers doesn’t scream excitement. Still, what I always enjoy about the Kappa logo is it looks like a couple who have fallen out. The badge is silicone and the sleeves are, in the tradition, blue. You don’t mess with that. The emblematic lion is near the collar on the “reverse”, which is manufacturer speak for the back. The goalie strip is a dark green with yellow accents. W88 is out and new sponsor Cazoo is in a brand name I hate saying because it sounds like a children’s television character. The away kit (and third) isn’t yet announced, so I’m assuming all games will be played at Villa Park this season.The Seagulls’ kit, modelled above by new boy Adam Lallana, is lovely and is inspired by their 1983 shirt although that did happen to be the year the team were relegated (but also reached the FA Cup final). The lack of fat white stripes may not be universally embraced, and though I love the collar, not everybody agrees judging by the fan who commented on Twitter: “The collar is an abomination.” The sponsor remains American Express, a card I’m still to see accepted anywhere in the UK.If you’d like to watch an overly earnest but actually quite emotional promo video, narrated by Bobby Zamora, you can do that here.Burnley took so long to announce their new kits that they had already been leaked via Panini cards. As with many clubs’ forthcoming kits, the Clarets’ one pays homage to successful seasons past. In this case, the inspiration is a literal antique kit – the 1920-21 outfit in which the team went 30 games unbeaten. The collar has a V-shaped cut in it, which, if we’re being mean, looks like an unintentional tear, but we’re not, so I’ll say that it’s actually a design that stands out over pedestrian collar choices. The goalkeeper kit is a bright orange.If you want to watch a promo video that is so long it feels like a Peter Jackson film, then you can do that here.Chelsea showcased their new home kit towards the end of last season, and as far as press releases go, theirs might be the snobbiest. The herringbone detail on the new jersey brings “a touch of Savile Row to Stamford Bridge”. Tammy Abraham says: “You can see the story behind the kit with how it looks and all the little touches that remind you of a good suit.”The Palace home and away kits are a good-looking duo (see also: Jordan Ayew and Jeffery Schlupp modelling them here), as is the third. Puma’s designs are the same across all kits, as in 2012-2013, with different main colours (home: blue away: white third: black).I especially like how chairman Steve Parish admitted to essentially nicking the idea from a fan: “I was immediately inspired when I saw the concept from a supporter who had shared designs on Instagram, with perfect synergy across all the kits for the upcoming season. Working closely with Puma and our design team at Crystal Palace, we believed these were the designs we had to bring to life, and I’m proud to say we’ve done so.”I’ll focus on Everton’s away kit, because it’s a throwback to the amber of the late 60s and early 70s away kits. As with the home kit, the shoulders feature the sporty chevrons beloved of designer, Hummel. Whether the printed badge will stick properly to the shirt – a problem reported previously by fans – remains to be seen. The goalkeepers’ away kit is a very snazzy pink number with what looks like a heart monitor on it. It’s a great kit, though somehow not in keeping with the plain yellow of outfield.If you’d like to watch an overly earnest but actually quite emotional promo video – again – you can do that here.Fulham have yet to announce their kits, but to be fair they did have a lot going on. ie winning promotion back to the Premier League. Still, it does rather feel like the Titanic meme of older Rose saying: “It’s been 84 years”… and still no kit. Fans can only hope the new kits will be as suave as Scott Parker.Fans have been in raptures over the new Leeds home shirt, and it is easy to see why it is simple design with understated blue accents. Even though I have no idea what “white waffle” is, which according to the official website is what it is made of. It is unfortunate too that new sponsor, SBOTOP, resembles a bad hand in Scrabble. The kit has been so popular that errors on the online shop mean that some people have ended up being charged £500 for shirts they haven’t actually managed to purchase. It’s a good kit, but perhaps not that good.Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy here, wearing Leicester’s kit, which features a new sponsor, or a slogan, at least: Thailand Smiles With You. This has been chosen by the tourism authority of Thailand, which makes sense, because as a slogan it is pure tourist board. Rather confusingly, fan replica shirts will still feature King Power as the sponsor, as will the first-team shirt in cups. So I guess Thailand Smiles With You, Sometimes. The home goalkeepers’ kit is all black with green accents.If you want to watch a cringeworthy promotional video narrated by Vardy, you can do that here.I am biased, but I love it. At first I was not sure about the teal accents – a bit Wrigley’s Cool Breeze chewing gum – but it is an appropriate homage to the Liver Bird statues, and it works. I can still almost smell the mint, but that’s no bad thing – it reminds me of Jürgen Klopp’s insane teeth. It’s a beautiful first kit for Liverpool and Nike, even though I did rather like the underdog feel of New Balance.The away kit is full on teal, and full on in general. With pattern elements that look a bit like torn paper but also the sea. It’s bonkers, and about four designs in one, but at least it isn’t dull. The third kid is ostensibly a black, squared number, but to be confirmed. As for Alisson, he’ll be wearing black at home and yellow away.The new United home kit – worn for the first time (above) during the Europa League tie against Lask – has the pattern of a bus seat, but according to a video on the club website it is made of “DNA” (as beloved by Ole Gunnar Soljskær). It isn’t, it’s made of polyester. And yet, somehow, despite being an Arriva doppelganger, it is rather nice. A lot of the details are frankly too intricate to notice (apparently it has Manchester United written into the fabric) but the stitching element is pleasant. But it’s not a huge departure when you’d need glasses like 90s Deirdre Barlow to notice it.Meanwhile, canny fans have noted that the ostensible away kit (not confirmed) seems to be inspired by Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures.Some good news for the Magpies amid their shambles of a takeover bid: their new kits are good. The underwhelming and same old but new home kit (and goalkeepers’ strip) was released a little while ago – it’s a burden of the club colours that the team will always look like 11 referees – but the away and third kits have now dropped and they are quite something. The official blurb on the away kit uses the words “fizzy yellow” approximately 400 times, though it is more of a lime green. Basically, these kits are on acid, which you can see in the picture above. So is the goalkeeper away kit, which is even better in hot pink and has a honeycomb base, similar to City’s goalie kits.Adidas’s new kit for the Blades has an angular black collar with traditional red and white stripes and, on the back, a quirky touch with the stripes only on the lower half of the shirt (though it’s possible a full back worth of stripes wouldn’t be allowed by the powers that be). The away kit, described as “glory pink and solid grey” is one of the nicest for the season. The shade of pink is similar to that of Manchester United’s away kit in 2018-19, which was endearingly based on the page colour of a historical local footy paper. In terms of a throwback this has to be the biggest of all Southampton celebrate their 135th anniversary with this homage to their very first kit in 1885. It is being billed as “the sash is back”, and that it is. (Although back in 1885 it was a physical sash worn atop the shirts.) The home kit is red with a white sash (black shorts), and the third kit is white with a red sash (plus white shorts).The away kit is a sashless outlier, in blue with yellow accents. It’s fine but could easily be a supermarket uniform and I doubt fans will be pleased that it’s basically a Portsmouth kit. It would have made more sense for the third kit to be the away kit imho, but then no one at Under Armour asked me. The goalkeeper kits come in neon pink and yellow, like radioactive Battenberg. But, as we’ve seen, that’s a look I endorse.In scenes of recent drama, Southampton have dropped the LD sponsor, as seen above, for reasons that aren’t clear, but the club statement refers to an “extremely complex situation”, which I guess is the football kit equivalent of a Facebook relationship status of “it’s complicated”. The Chinese brand was not deemed an “appropriate partner” and a hasty one-year deal struck instead with a betting firm. I’ve never thought betting firms were appropriate partners either, but again, I was not consulted.This is a handsome, refreshing design from Nike. The v-shaped collar with yellow is much more interesting than recent efforts – Spurs kits are often a little lacklustre. The navy half-shoulders are nice too. It has the vibe of when someone makes the effort and scrubs up surprisingly well.Harry Kane, presumably reading from a sheet of paper in front of him, says of the dark green away kit that the “small details make a big difference”. The thing is, they actually do: the “lava” (read: salmon pink) and black touches avoid a by-numbers feel as does the dark green itself – a rare hue in kit world. This time the collar is round.If you would like to watch a promo video with – for some reason – creepy, haunting music, then you can do that here.The Puma shirt for the promoted Baggies harks back to the popular “barcode” design of 1992-93 (also a promotion season). Unclear whether it has to be put through a self-checkout a minimum of three times to be recognised. The away shirt has the same retro design but in the yellow and green colours that have a long history for the club, and have been popular with fans since their resurgence over the past couple of seasons. The shorts have switched back to green from yellow. For some reason “Ideal Boilers” as a sponsor will always make me laugh.The new Hammers home kit is pretty rote, but the away version is lovely (seen above), Umbro’s hooped design is reminiscent of the club’s 60s heyday. It is also the 125th anniversary kit, which as far as I can tell, means it has a “125” on the neckline. The away goalkeeper kit, meanwhile, is a fun but Wotsit level orange. And why not?I struggle with Wolves’ home kits purely because black and gold were the colours of my school PE kit. And while I really loved PE, it does mean that, sartorially, Wolves will always be a flashback to netball-after-lunch for me. The new home kit isn’t mind-blowing but the new goalkeepers’ outfit, above, is eye-catching. It’s not a million miles away from last seasons’s – OK, it’s about one mile away – but this is the first season the replica goalkeeper shirt will be available in short sleeves, as preferred by Rui Patrício. It has bolder black accents down the side of the shirt, as well as around the collar. There, you’re all kitted out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979fd3684160e18683e6138e6ec3c2d195ae0928/0_92_5488_3293/master/5488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79ef44be3f65da8c1ea2bf2e136dec5b","title":"arsenal v liverpool 2020 community shield live","story":"Arsenal get the second half underway. No changes.Half-time entertainment. Hannah Jane Parkinson anticipates the new season by running the rule over all the new shirts.The Gunners started slowly, but go into the break deservedly leading. It’s not happened for Liverpool up front.45 min: Saka whistles a ball in from the left. It rolls invitingly through the six-yard box, but Nketiah hasn’t gambled and Liverpool get away with it. There will be one added minute.43 min: Saka’s corner is a non-event. In lieu of action, here’s Matt Dony: “Right. First game of the season, and I’m already annoyed. The referee, the commentary team and Peter Walton all agree that ‘There wasn’t enough contact for Mane to go down.’ Can anyone point out the rule that says there has to be enough contact to knock someone down? If you pull someone back, even slightly, while making no effort to play the ball, how is it not a foul? And this isn’t one-eyed Liverpool bias I get just as annoyed when Liverpool players do it. Skrtel essentially built his whole game around it, and it infuriated me every time. Ah, I hate football.”42 min: Maitland-Niles stands one up from the left, momentarily confusing Alisson, but Milner ushers it away from a throw. Arsenal work it around to the left again, allowing Tierney to have a whack. The shot balloons off Gomez and out for a corner.40 min: One corner leads to another. And another. Arsenal are struggling to get out. From the third, Robertson curls delightfully from the left. Mane eyebrows it gently. At the far post, Van Dijk mistimes his attempt at trundling home, and the ball sails harmlessly out of play for a throw. Robertson will be wondering how he’s not got an assist to his name. On another day, he could have had two or three.39 min: Salah threads a stunning diagonal pass through a small gap in the Arsenal defence to Robertson on the left. His low fizzer is poked out for a corner by Bellerin. Just as well, for red (and teal) shirts were lined up behind him.38 min: Arsenal stroke it around the back a bit in the old George Graham style. A smart move, with Liverpool having built up a little momentum.36 min: Gomez hoicks an extremely ambitious shot over the bar from distance. No need for this sort of traffic-on-North-Circular-bothering desperation yet.35 min: It’s not quite happening for Liverpool. Mane does extremely well to keep the ball in down the left and tiptoes along the tightrope. Robertson joins in and whips another fine ball through the six-yard box. Salah can’t reach it with his big toe.33 min: More good work from Arsenal down the left flank, and the ball ends up at the feet of Nketiah, just inside the Liverpool box. He tries to sort his feet out, but can’t fix them in time, and Van Dijk grabs the opportunity to intercept and clear.31 min: Liverpool try to raise the tempo. Mane and Firmino exchange crisp passes down the left. A little brush between Bellerin and Mane, the latter going over, but he’s not getting a penalty for that. Robertson fizzes the loose ball across the face of goal, but there’s nobody there to poke home. Then another phase, and Salah has a shot blocked easily enough.30 min: Milner sends a couple of crosses in from the left. Both are cleared easily enough, though hats off for the skill he displayed before the second, taking down a looping Gomez pass with an exquisite cushioned touch and spin.28 min: Saka finds Nketiah down the inside-left channel. Nketiah drops a shoulder and, in looking for the top right, lashes well over the bar. It’s Arsenal who are looking more likely at the moment. Liverpool have barely threatened since falling behind.26 min: Williams thinks about delivering a ball into the Arsenal box from the right. He hesitates, and allows Aubameyang, tracking back at speed, to nick it off his toe. Aubameyang is clearly willing to put in the work Arteta demands. Now they just need to get him to sign a new contract.24 min: So having said that, it all goes a bit scrappy. Both teams are playing it like they mean it, though. Don’t let anyone argue this means nothing.22 min: Williams and Milner take turns to shoot from the edge of the Arsenal box. Both attempts are blocked at source. Liverpool come again, Milner trying to find Firmino in the middle with a hooked pass, but Arsenal hold firm. This match is good fun.21 min: Some space for Tierney down the left. He crosses too high, and it’s an easy claim for Alisson. But the momentum has almost totally flipped. Now it’s Arsenal who are first to everything, enjoying the lion’s share of possession.19 min: Saka isn’t perfect, mind, and he loops the resulting corner into Alisson’s arms. What a prospect the 18-year-old is, though. A real discovery.18 min: Gomez is robbed by Nketiah in the centre circle. The ball’s slipped wide right for Saka, who nearly gets a second assist, advancing down the flank then cutting back for Nketiah, who doesn’t have to break stride as he sidefoots powerfully towards the bottom right. Alisson does extremely well to turn the shot around the post.16 min: Hats off to Saka for the crossfield ball that set Aubameyang on his way. It was a sensational pass. Something’s afoot at Arsenal under Arteta.14 min: That goal came very much against the run of play, and Liverpool look a little stunned. A question mark over Williams’ positioning, though Tierney was making off on the overlap, so he had plenty to think about.Arsenal go straight up the other end and score! Saka sweeps right to left. Aubameyang drives at Williams down the left. He nudges the ball inside, given too much time and space, and lashes an unstoppable curler into the bottom right! What a finish!12 min: Luiz slices out of play under pressure from the Liverpool press. Williams takes up possession on the right and curls onto Milner’s head. He should work Martinez at the very least, but heads harmlessly over.11 min: Liverpool have enjoyed 60 percent of possession so far. Arsenal are struggling to put anything significant together.9 min: Arsenal seem happy enough to sit back and look for Aubameyang with long passes. It’s all easy enough for Van Dijk and Gomez at the minute. Here’s Tom Hopkins: “That Arsenal kit put me in mind of the surface of Europa (the moon, not the limit of their continental ambitions).”7 min: Robertson curls it in. Van Dijk sticks out a boot and guides the ball across Martinez and into the bottom corner. He doesn’t bother celebrating the goal, because he clearly went too early and had been caught offside. The Arsenal back line holding their nerve well. VAR checks, totally unnecessarily, and we play on.6 min: Wijnaldum runs at Luiz down the inside left and is nudged over clumsily. A free kick. Everyone lines up on the edge of the Arsenal box.5 min: Robertson hares down the left and curls a glorious deep ball towards Salah, to the right of the D. Tierney sticks out a leg and nearly sends an absurd looper over Martinez’s head and into the top right. But the keeper backtracks well and claims. Tierney enjoyed that, a tacit admission that he might not have meant to do exactly what he did.3 min: Liverpool are further into their pre-season, and it’s showing in these very early exchanges. The champions first to everything at the minute. Mane breezes down the left and clips back for Robertson, haring down the inside-left channel. But the pass isn’t quite there. Holding does just enough to deal with the situation.1 min: Liverpool are immediately on the front foot, Mane shaking and shimmying at Bellerin down the left. Bellerin stands firm and passes his first test.Liverpool get the ball rolling. But not before a knee of solidarity and love is taken. Black lives matter.The teams are out! Arsenal are in their ... yes, we’ve already covered this, haven’t we. Suffice to say, at a slightly damp and dreary Wembley, we’ll be off in a couple of minutes. Just the national anthem, pennant swap and coin toss to get out of the way. “That Arsenal shirt looks like the kitman left his red pen in a track suit pocket while loading the last wash. Nobody is buying his Marble Halls malarkey,” writes iconoclastic architecture criticHere’s what happened the last time these two met.Mikel Arteta talks! “It’s always good to be back at Wembley. We’re going to be fighting for another trophy. We have some really nice memories of this stadium. But when this game is being played is a little bit awkward. Winning a trophy generates belief and it was great to win another FA Cup title. We know the opponent we are facing, but we are convinced that if we do what we have to do, we have a chance to win. A lot of names are not even on the bench at the moment, we have players that have only had one training session. But it is what it is, and we’re going to put out the strongest team possible. But having five days training is not ideal. Martinez was our goalkeeper in the FA Cup, and he deserves to play this final.”Jurgen Klopp speaks! “I would say we are ready. We have enjoyed training so far. Yes, the break was not too long, but it was absolutely OK. The boys look good. We are as fit as we can be. I hope I don’t have to spend all year talking about defending the title because I don’t understand that phrase 100 percent. We have the same in Germany, I never understood it there, it’s not about the language. You cannot defend a title when it’s an open race for everybody. So we try to attack again. But we don’t have a guarantee that it will work out, so why worry about that now? This is a really good opportunity for us, a big game, I am excited. But I saw the Arsenal line-up and it looks good.”Match rules. If it’s a draw after 90 minutes, there’s no extra time. We’ll be going straight to penalty kicks. Each team will be able to make a maximum of six substitutions.The FA Cup holders will be wearing this beauty today. It’s a nod to the marble halls at their much-missed Highbury pile.The league champions Liverpool will also show off some lovely new architecturally inspired threads. They’ll be sporting their usual first-choice red, now with a teal trim that references the birds atop the Liver Building. “The unique name and number fonts are designed to embody characteristics of Anfield and the surrounding area,” adds Nikolaus Pevsner.Eight of the Arsenal team that started the FA Cup final four weeks ago are named again. Not here at all this time: Dani Ceballos, Nicolas Pepe and Alexandre Lacazette.James Milner captains Liverpool in the absence of the injured Jordan Henderson. Trent Alexander-Arnold is also unfit he’s replaced at right-back by Neco Williams.The more things change, the more they stay the same. Here’s the legendary  football correspondent David Lacey on Liverpool in 1979: “Their strength remains in their teamwork and in their ability to get the basic details of passing and positioning right for most of the time. When they have got the ball they consistently make space, when they lose possession, space disappears.” There you have it: the laconic Bob Paisley and the gregarious Jurgen Klopp, two peas in a pod.Liverpool dominated Arsenal in that year’s Charity Shield. Alan Hansen channelled his inner Franz Beckenbauer, Terry McDermott scored twice, and a swaggering Kenny Dalglish display was topped when he sent Steve Walford off to the wrong fire before slotting past Pat Jennings. Liverpool won 3-1, payback for defeat in a marathon FA Cup semi the season before.Liverpool got a little payback again ten years later, as the teams met for the second time in the Charity Shield. This one came off the back of the Michael Thomas game, and Arsenal could be forgiven for not giving a solitary shiny one as Peter Beardsley scored the only goal of the game. Liverpool were dominant again that day, though couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that George Graham’s champions had got the better of the deal over the long haul.So here we go: round four! Liverpool haven’t won this thing since beating Chelsea in 2006 since then, Arsenal have won it in 2014, 2015 and 2017, seeing off Manchester City and Chelsea twice. Both clubs are looking to add the Shield to their roll of honour for the 16th time, though Arsenal have more outright wins, 14 to Liverpool’s ten. (They used to share back in the day, kids.) It’s the traditional curtain-raiser between champions and FA Cup winners that doesn’t really mean that much ... but neither side will be turning up their nose at silverware either. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a2abac9cc24cd5645380fa00dc0199faa7d453/0_188_6594_3956/master/6594.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=635828f71f4ff5d4cfc7efb57a29637e","title":"the fabric of life rare textiles from around the world in a french country house","story":"Rare textiles from all over the world enhance the rustic style of this French country houseI loved the way the light from the river reflected on the ceilings,” says Susan Deliss of the moment she first saw her rural French home. Positioned by the Serein river, which flows through the wine-growing region of Chablis, the 18th-century house has a laid-back French charm about it. Stone steps in the garden lead down to the water, where a small blue boat belonging to Deliss’s sons, Al, 16, and Gus, 14, gently bobs. Bessie the lurcher hides from the hot sun underneath a nearby fig tree.Beyond the front door, which is crowned with wisteria, a cool, dark hall awaits. Susan kept the original 19th-century tiles of orange, cream and grey, but had the kitchen floor, which was formerly a bathroom with broken concrete underfoot, replaced with tomettes – local, antique terracotta tiles. Kitchen units, sympathetic to the historical regional style, which is unfitted and freestanding, were added alongside a traditional Burgundy stone sink: wide and shallow.Copper pans, antique pots, plates and hand-painted dishes from all over Europe and Morocco hang on the walls. Deliss’s husband, Max, a conservator, made the well-worn pine kitchen table and, after experimenting with a wide range of paint colours, eventually settled on a soft orange for the kitchen walls. “I had 80 pots for the whole house,” says Deliss. “The kitchen can be very dark, and I like to be cosy. Orange just worked.”Deliss is a textile dealer and designer with a passion for antique fabrics. This dedication has led her deep into the souks of Egypt, Morocco, Turkey and Syria, searching for one-off materials. She’ll haggle for antique suzanis – highly decorative embroidered cloths, usually from Central Asia – ikats, hand-embroidered Persian textiles, and the richly coloured throws of Uzbekistan where, today, she has her own designs embroidered. “I sometimes meet a Hungarian waiter in west London to buy fabrics,” she adds. This interest in materials led her to design her own pieces, some of which are woven in the UK, while others are screen-printed by hand.Uzbeki coats hang on the walls as decoration in the dining room and hall. Suzanis, the word derives from the Persian for needle, hang in the sitting room and are used to cover headboards and as ornate bedspreads in the bedrooms.As a child, Deliss would sew her own clothes and redecorate her doll’s house. Some of her earliest memories are of specific materials – the red floral cotton of a trouser suit that her aunt made for her and, on a French exchange aged 11, linen-covered walls and a cherry-wood dining table.“I love beautiful things, like Islamic architecture and textiles. I appreciate the structure. They are to textiles what Bach is to music. There is a mathematical structure that creates order, and the beauty in that order is very appealing.”The windows in her Burgundy home still have their original glass and wooden shutters. “Antique glass is uneven, which I love. The shutters protect the house from the heat in summer and the cold in winter. When we first arrived in the village, nothing looked as if it had been changed for a century and I wanted this house to have that feel,” she adds.This directive inspired the rest of the house, which she refers to as dans son jus – literally, “cooked in its own juice”. “The design evolved gradually and gracefully,” she explains. “I did not want it to look as if it had been jarred out of the condition it was in. I did a huge amount to re-patinate. I did not want it to appear new or overdone, but to have a gentle, benign beauty.”Upstairs, she and Max added new bathrooms. Each piece of furniture was chosen carefully from auction houses and local brocantes. The couple, who were married in the local town hall, love to cook together.“This is an old house in a medieval village,” says Deliss. “When I first bought it, 20 years ago, nobody living locally had anything new. Things are changing – fitted kitchens are popping up – but I made a deliberate choice to fill this house with things that are old. It gives it a lovely feel. It is a step removed from the modern world, which is why I bought it in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9debe5cab0eb8010c82312ef99e65ab08477121b/256_138_1573_944/master/1573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=070c97f82ae38dfc4fce50409542640c","title":"material gains mid century italian textiles in pictures","story":"Fabrics made by the MITA textile firm (1926-1976) in Genoa blurred the line between product and art.

Its founder has said the BBC is a “disgrace” that “is bad for Britain on so many levels” and “needs to be broken up”.A rival project is being devised in the headquarters of Rupert Murdoch’s British media empire by the former Fox News executive David Rhodes, although it is unclear whether it will result in a traditional TV channel or be online-only.Both are pitching to a perceived gap in the market for opinionated video output fuelled by growing distrust of the BBC among some parts of its audience, especially on the political right over culture war issues such as Brexit and whether Rule, Britannia! should be sung at the Last Night of the Proms.The prize is twofold: the political influence that would come with breaking the BBC and Sky’s control of British rolling news, along with the potential profits if it is possible to replicate some of the enormous audiences that tune in to watch opinionated talkshow hosts in the US, where Fox News is hugely profitable.GB News is the work of a company called All Perspectives, controlled by two British-American executives who are associated with the US billionaire John Malone. Known as the “cable cowboy”, Malone chairs Liberty Global, the owner of Virgin Media, as well as the parent company of the Discovery television network.Andrew Cole, one of the co-founders of GB News, also sits on the board of Liberty Global. He told the  he hoped to be able to discuss the project in September, but he has previously made clear his views on the broadcasting landscape.He told his LinkedIn followers that the BBC was “possibly the most biased propaganda machine in the world” and to “watch out for announcements of famous presenters and the launch of a completely new TV news channel for the UK – one that will be distinctly different from the out-of-touch incumbents”. He added: “The people need and want this new perspective.”Sources with knowledge of the project suggested GB News was in discussions with Discovery about a tie-up, with the potential for an announcement in September. It has a licence in place and while this does not guarantee the channel will make it to air – or that it will be called GB News – it means Ofcom has been provided with the outline business case, distribution plans and intended audience. Discovery declined to comment.The challenge both projects face is the UK’s strict broadcast rules on due impartiality, enforced by the media regulator. One possible route around them is to follow the lead of the radio station LBC, which has achieved record audiences by realising that the rules can be interpreted to allow strongly opinionated presenters, so long as they are balanced out elsewhere in the schedule with alternative viewpoints.A similar model has been followed by Piers Morgan’s outbursts on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, which regularly become talking points online and drive substantial traffic to tabloid newspapers. News UK’s TalkRadio has pushed this tactic further, with regular debates on culture war hot topics rapidly turned into clips shared on social media.Rhodes, who was hired by News UK in the spring and most recently served as president of CBS News, is said by sources at the company to have the backing of Lachlan Murdoch, the heir apparent to the business empire. He has been seen taking an interest in the TalkRadio model. A News UK spokesperson declined to comment on the suggestion that a fully fledged news channel was in the works but confirmed he was continuing to work on “video projects”.One of the great unknowns of any such project is the role of Nigel Farage. The former Ukip leader left LBC amid staff anger over his comments on migrants crossing the Channel, but he has the potential to deliver a ready-made anti-BBC, pro-Brexit audience. He has recently appeared on the Sun’s YouTube channel and TalkRadio, both owned by News UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

Some universities have been in turmoil, with all of them preoccupied with how to best ensure the welfare of students and staff.And then there’s the question of what is going to await students when they get there. How is the teaching and learning going to be delivered? What if you want to study remotely at first? What does all that mean for accommodation – is there going to be some flexibility? Can you even definitely afford to go to university, given that part-time work will probably be hard to come by for the foreseeable future, and many families have seen their finances take a heavy hit as a result of coronavirus? And what about freshers’ week – will it all be online?We can’t answer every single query that people will have, but we can provide lots of information, tips and advice to help you get “university-ready” and avoid some of the potential coronavirus-related pitfalls.Students at Oxford and Newcastle are the biggest spenders on booze, while those in Bristol typically spend the most on groceries. Meanwhile, 2020’s most affordable city for students overall is Manchester.These are just some of the findings of a NatWest survey of more than 2,800 UK university students carried out in June this year.They were asked how much they spend each month on average on a range of items. Excluding rent, supermarket food shopping, toiletries and household items was the biggie at a typical £81, while going out (gigs, theatre, cinema, clubs etc) and eating out (takeaways, coffees, restaurant meals and so on) both came in at an average of £33 each.The figure for alcohol, which includes both booze drunk at home and while out, was £29 a month.Students also said they spent an average of £23 a month on utility bills £26 on day-to-day travel £15 on books, course materials, printing and library costs etc £32 on clothes, shoes and accessories £12 on mobile phone bills and related costs and £11 on self-care and wellbeing (gym, beauty treatments etc).However, there were some big regional variations. On alcohol, the monthly spend figures in Oxford and Newcastle were £45 and £40 respectively – well above the £18 for London and Leicester.Similarly, the amount you could expect to pay for a pint in your university city ranged from £2.80 in Durham and £2.90 in Swansea to £4.50 in London and £5 in Cambridge.There is, of course, no one-size-fits-all answer for how much money students will spend each month – the costs vary greatly depending on where you are going. Also, while some students will have cash to splash, others will be watching every penny.Your living costs could well be slightly higher during the first term because of books and equipment you need to buy, items you have forgotten to bring, and paying for any in-person freshers’ week events that are allowed to happen.Wait until you arrive at your halls of residence or student house before splashing out. Assess what is already there. For example, Wilko is offering savings on a range of student kitchen essentials until 6 October, such as a Russell Hobbs Textures kettle and toaster reduced from £20 to £15 each.If you are heading to the London School of Economics, how about a room in its High Holborn Residence, a self-catered hall located just minutes from Covent Garden and Soho? It sounds nice, but for a single room (albeit with a queen-size bed) the weekly rent is £304 – which adds up to more than £11,800 for a 39-week tenancy. And for that, you don’t even get your own bathroom – you have to share.At the other end of the spectrum, the universities of Wolverhampton and Wrexham Glyndŵr both have halls of residence rooms starting from £90 a week.According to money advice website Save the Student’s most recent national survey, the average paid for university-owned accommodation is £142 a week. But, as can be seen from the above examples, that figure disguises wide variations.Most students opt to stay in university accommodation during their first year. And some have a dizzying array of options – basic to luxury, self-cateredpart-cateredfully catered, centrally located or miles out of town, and so on. Some people will have known for ages where they are going and will have already chosen a room, while others are still working through their options.This year there are a whole load of extra issues in the mix because of the pandemic. Earlier this year there was anger over the fact that some existing students in lockdown at home were being forced to pay for unused accommodation. So those planning to live in a university-owned hall of residence or privately run student accommodation, should check the small print very carefully and make sure they are clear about their rights and responsibilities, and whether there is any flexibility if Covid-19 continues to cause havoc.Some universities have made changes – for example, Coventry has amended its accommodation agreement so students will be able to surrender their so-called “licence to occupy”, and the financial commitment that goes with it, if the campus has to close for 21 consecutive days or more.Covid-19 has meant other changes, too. Wolverhampton is among the universities allocating halls of residence rooms based on the campus where the student’s course is taking place, in order to reduce the amount of travelling between sites.How you pay, and when, tends to vary. Many universities require an upfront payment, but at others you don’t need to pay any fees until after you’ve moved in. Paying for your accommodation in three instalments – typically in SeptemberOctober, January and April – is fairly standard, though some universities will accept a monthly direct debit.It’s not compulsory to have a student bank account, but they offer features you usually can’t get elsewhere.When you apply, you’ll be asked to provide proof of your student status. This could be a letter of acceptance from your university, though some banks will ask for your Ucas “status codes” (usually sent out via email).For many, the key feature of a student bank account – far outweighing any freebies – will be the size of the interest-free overdraft on offer.Halifax and Santander offer students a £1,500 interest-free overdraft from the outset of year one, which is generous, says Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts. The Halifax overdraft deal is up to £1,500 for the length of your course, plus an extra year after you graduate, up to a maximum of six years. Santander’s is £1,500 in years one, two and three, £1,800 in year four, and £2,000 if you stay on to year five.There are often conditions – for example, with Santander, when you open your account you’ll get an overdraft limit of £250, and to increase this to £1,500 you’ll need to pay in £500 and continue to pay in at least £500 per academic term.Santander also offers a pretty decent perk: a free four-year 16-25 Railcard, saving students up to a third on most rail fares.HSBC starts people off with a guaranteed interest-free limit of £1,000 in the first year. You can then request a limit of up to £2,000 in year two and £3,000 in year three. Barclays and Nationwide offer broadly similar deals. Meanwhile, NatWest is offering a limit of up to £2,000, though the maximum in the first term is £500."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd1ac02e5c0fdfe47d24f02769ea8794864c3a9/0_0_4480_6321/master/4480.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11984edb9da9d6461e9fd02ee09d1926 880w","title":"barnier flabbergasted uk attempt reopen brexit specialty food drink debate","story":"Bloc sources say Britain is trying to water down EU geographical protectionsThe UK government has renewed its attempt to reopen the chapter of the Brexit orce treaty protecting specialty food and drink, such as Parma ham, roquefort cheese and champagne, in a move that left the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, “a little bit flabbergasted”.The British proposal on protected status for food and drink was included in a draft free-trade agreement handed to Barnier by his opposite number, David Frost, last week, according to two EU sources.But EU officials have ruled out diluting the orce deal provisions that protect more than 3,000 high-end food and drink products from copycats. “It’s just not going to happen,” said one official.The withdrawal agreement signed between Boris Johnson and EU leaders last October preserves the status of food and drink protected under the EU’s geographical indications (GI) policy. A top priority for EU trade negotiators, these rules bar English or Spanish vintners from calling their sparkling wine champagne, for example, while only crumbly cheese from Greece can be labelled feta. Under the withdrawal treaty, the protection applies “unless and until” a new deal can be negotiated.According to EU sources, the UK is attempting to water down protection for EU geographical indications, while keeping the special status for British produce, such as Scotch whisky, Melton Mowbray pork pies and Cornish pasties.The return of the proposal, floated in the early stages of trade talks last spring, caused astonishment. “The asymmetry was met with open mouths. Why would you even suggest that in a serious negotiation?” said the EU source. Barnier was “a little bit flabbergasted”, the person added.The government disputes the EU description of its proposal and argues Barnier is making unprecedented demands to tie Britain to European standards – demands, it says, not made on other trade partners such as Canada or Japan.A UK government official said the British proposal on specialty foods was “in line with the withdrawal agreement” and would provide protection for existing and future GIs for both sides “as is standard” across the EU’s free-trade agreements. “The UK proposal would allow existing EU GIs that meet the requirements of the UK’s new domestic regime to be protected in the UK,” the official said.British negotiators argue they signed up to the food provisions in the withdrawal treaty in the expectation they would be superseded by a future deal.Frost, a former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, which campaigns to stop foreign rivals using the name “Scotch”, included the GI proposal in a draft trade agreement he hoped would inject new momentum into the stalled negotiations.But the British “consolidated text” has gone down badly in Brussels. In trade negotiations, usually both sides work out a consolidated text once they have agreed on general principles. The British text is said to incorporate wording on which both sides agree, but also highlights areas of disagreement.One EU diplomat, who had not seen the text, said it was “not very useful because it focused mainly on offensive issues for the UK”, meaning issues where the government is seeking an advantage.The UK has not said if it plans to publish the text sent to Barnier.Sandro Gozi, an Italian MEP elected on the ticket of the French centrist party La République En Marche, cast doubt on whether the UK intended to unwind the protected food provisions of the withdrawal agreement. “If it was real, from a French or an Italian perspective, we cannot go back on geographical indications. Geographical indications are the priority No 1 of any new trade agreement for the EU.”Brussels negotiators are warning only a few weeks remain to seal a deal before the EU deadline of late October. “The next negotiation round in September will be crucial,” said a second EU diplomat. “If it ends without any progress as well, the window to close a deal will close quickly. Time would simply be running out.”The EU has said it needs around two months to legally fine-tune and ratify a treaty before the end of the transition period on 31 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b14af2d1e47e6da2acefc0d4c334665579cae3/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e7a997fb866388c12dd1002053c12bde","title":"hamilton takes pole for belgian grand prix while ferrari misery continues","story":"Carrying an emotional burden only spurred Lewis Hamilton on to greater heights in taking pole for the Belgian Grand Prix. He dedicated his own riveting performance at Spa-Francorchamps to the memory of actor Chadwick Boseman, who died on Friday. Hamilton admitted the news had left him almost broken but felt the actor had been such an inspiration to young black people he desperately wanted to deliver in his honour.While Hamilton dominated in Spa, at the other end of the grid Ferrari flailed and foundered in the forests of the Ardennes. Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel failed to make it into the top 10 shootout and finished in 13th and 14th respectively.For Hamilton, only afterwards did he reveal how the news of the death of Boseman, the black American actor who played Black Panther in four Marvel films, had weighed heavily on him. Having been a strident voice in F1’s anti-racism campaign and a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, Hamilton took the death of an inspirational black figure, whom he had met in New York, personally.“This was an important pole, I woke up today to the saddest news of Chadwick passing away,” he said. “It’s been such a heavy year for us all and that news broke me, so it wasn’t easy to get back focused. Our superhero died last night, that was weighing heavy on me today. I was so driven to deliver a good performance so I could dedicate it to Chad.”The world champion felt Boseman had played a vital role in promoting the ersity which Hamilton has also championed. “I am a huge Marvel fan and knowing how Hollywood has been, to see the first black superhero come out, everyone was just so proud,” he said. “This under-representation is such a common thing, to see someone like him make it to be such a powerful figure in the Avengers world was incredible and inspiring. I can imagine young black kids looking up and seeing that it as possible to be a superhero, so his legacy will always live on.”At the sharp end Hamilton betrayed no sign of the sadness he was feeling. He looked nailed on for the top spot from the moment he took to the track. His first hot run in Q3 saw him confident enough to lead the field out, unconcerned by trying to find a slipstream.Exploiting every inch of the track and the clear pace advantage he was enjoying, a blistering lap ensued with a time of 1min 41.451sec. It was over a half a second clear of his teammate Valtteri Bottas. Leading the way again on his second run, the British driver found even more. He went two-tenths quicker in 1.41.252 and Bottas remained second, a full half a second adrift, an age for a driver in identical machinery. The Red Bull of Max Verstappen was in third.For Ferrari, what was expected to be a trying weekend deteriorated into only narrowly avoiding humiliation. Their car has been down on power all season since the FIA issued a clarification on the engine regulations to the team, in a controversial private settlement. They knew it would cost them at the power-dependent Spa but no one anticipated a descent almost to the back of the grid. The car also has aero problems, creating too much drag, and in Belgium they struggled to switch on the tyres because they were experimenting with a low-downforce setup to combat the speed deficit. It left them with a lack of grip, compounding their woes.Last year they were dominant at Spa. They led every session before the race with a one-two and Leclerc took pole with a seven-tenths advantage. He went on to win untroubled from the front. This time they went backwards through practice, 14th and 15th and 15th and 17th on Friday, before the ignominy of the final session on Saturday morning when Leclerc was 17th and Vettel last in 20th.In qualifying they were close to being beaten by the Ferrari-engined Haas and Alfa Romeo cars, not to mention the rest of the midfield. A yellow flag late in Q1 that slowed some final hot laps may have spared them going out in the first session. With the car designs frozen for cost-saving purposes in 2021, a long and painful season and a half stretches ahead of the Scuderia.Daniel Ricciardo was in fourth for Renault with Red Bull’s Alexander Albon in fifth.

This has been an emotional week and I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support.”Azarenka, the last of three mothers in the tournament, wins her second Cincinnati title by default, the 21st of her career and her first in four years.The tournament announced Osaka’s decision about 90 minutes before the final was supposed to begin in Louis Armstrong Stadium at the site of the US Open. The event is normally held in Ohio but was moved to New York because of the coronavirus pandemic as part of a two-tournament “controlled environment”.The first of Osaka’s two grand slam titles came at Flushing Meadows, in 2018. The 22-year-old, who was born in Japan and is now based in the US, brought the push for racial justice to the tennis tour on Wednesday by saying she was not going to play in her semi-final, joining athletes in the NBA, Major League Baseball and other sports in sitting out in reaction to police shooting in Wisconsin of a black man, Jacob Blake. Osaka’s stance prompted the tournament to say it was taking a “pause” to back the cause and scrapping all scheduled matches for Thursday.When play resumed on Friday, Osaka did compete, beating Elise Mertens. But Osaka grabbed her left hamstring after chasing a ball during the tie-break.Azarenka, ranked 59 in the world, collects her first title since 2016 and the 21st of her career, the 20th at a hard‑court event. The two-times Australian Open champion and two‑times US Open runner-up has been ranked as high as No 1.

Team Ineos riders Pavel Sivakov and Andrey Amador are those who hurt themselves today, while George Bennett from Jumbo-Visma also took a spill. Parish notice: The race organisers have decided that all of the timings for today’s stage will be taken at the three kilometre from the finish mark. That finish: Kristoff came from behind to win by more than a bike-length, with Peter Sagan unable to mount any sort of challenge despite being in a great position to do so.“I felt really strong in the final kilometres, I found a good wheel and I knew I was going to win. I was sitting on Sagan for a long time. At the end I was too strong and that was wonderful for me. My run-in to this Tour has not been great and I had no results to show. I was also banged up but it didn’t affect me to do.” Kristoff wins: A frenetic day’s racing ends in victory for Alexander Kristoff. Sam Bennett appeared to get boxed in in the closing stages. We’re still waiting for a replay of the final dash for the line. It’s been a miserable day for many of the riders - all those caught up in the most recent crash are limping over the line in dribs and drabs. The veteran UAE Team Emirates sprinter rides the wheels to pull off something of a shock and win the opening stage of the 2020 Tour de France.The finish: Sam Bennett is boxed in and has to check. 1km to go: The leaders go under the one kilometre to go kite.3km to go: There’s a big crash in the back half of the peloton, with up to 20 or more riders going down at speed. Thibaut Pinot is one of them – the crash happened inside the final three kilometres so the riders will all get the same time as the main bunch. 5km to go: The road is wide, four lanes wide, as the riders jockey for position ahead of the finish. Sam Bennett, Peter Sagan, Alexander Kristoff and Giacomo Nizzolo are all well placed. 6km to go: Deceuninck- Quick-Step have Irish sprinter Sam Bennett in a good position ahead of the lead-out. 7km to go: Having led the peloton along for kilometres, Tony Martin starts going backwards. Robert Gesink takes over for Jumbo Visma. 10km to go: The peloton is nicely bunched with all the major sprinters nicely positioned in their respective trains as we enter the final 10 kilometres of the first stage. NTT sprinter Giacomo Nizzolo is the exception to the rule, Edvald Boasson Hagen being the only teammate he has with him. Peter Sagan’s Bora-Hansgrohe are lined up nicely, preparing to ride a finish to put Peter Sagan at the front near the finish line. 15km to go: Cosnefroy’s lead is reduced to six seconds. At the back of the field, George Bennett is weaving his way through the race cars and is about to latch on to the back of the bunch. 18km to go: Deceuninck-Quick-Step are controlling the front of the peloton, hoping to reel in Cosnefroy and set up a sprint finish for Sam Bennett. Cosnefroy has a 17 second lead over the bunch. 20km to go: AG2R La Mondiale rider Benoit Cosnefroy attacks off the front of the bunch and quickly opens a gap of 14 seconds. He’s a good time trial rider and the teams of the main sprinters will need to keep an eye on him. 25km to go: “Having a crash on the first day of a Grand Tour is horrible, because the first week is stressful enough already,” says David Millar on ITV. There are no end of riders who have got off to a bad start today, the worst affected being George Bennett (Jumbo-Visma) and Pavel Sivakov (Ineos), who have come a cropper three times between them this afternoon and will be finishing today’s stage on their own. 29km to go: The peloton remains fairly tightly bunched as the riders prepare to get their ducks in a row for what seems an inevitable sprint finish. 33km to go: The peloton is meandering along at a leisurely 38km per hour, taking no risks. “This is effectively a riders’ strike,” says race commentator Ned Boulting on ITV. 34km to go: Ineos rider Pavel Sivakov is still riding off the back of the bunch following his two crashes this afternoon. 39km to go: After a very eventful, stressful afternoon’s racing for the peloton, there are less than 40 kilometres to go as the riders enjoy the relative calm before what promises to be a serious storm of a sprint finish on Nice’s Promenade Des Anglais. 40km to go: Nairo Quintana was one of many fallers today. Here’s footage of his spill ... 41km to go: Caleb Ewan has rejoined the peloton, having been led back by Jasper De Buyst and another of his Lotto Soudal team-mates. That Lopez crash: The Astana rider was quite lucky as he was going at a fair pelt and narrowly avoided hitting a low wall with a potentially long drop on the other side. 46km to go: It’s game on again as three Astan riders sprint off the front of the bunch. One of them, Miguel Anguel Lopez, loses his back wheel out from under him and control of his bike, skids off the wet road and into a sign post. He’s OK, but needs a new bike. Tour favourite Primoz Roglic gives Lopez’s team-mate Omar Fraile a bollocking and tells him to slow down. The road is so wet ... covered in surface water. 48km to go: Costa Rican rider Andrey Amador, who rides for Ineos, is having a very unhappy 34th birthday. Having suffered a crash earlier, he’s now adrift of the peloton again after suffering a mechanical. 50km to go: Sam Bennett is about to regain contact with the bunch, who have slowed down on the descent to let various fallers catch up with them. Caleb Ewan and John Degenkolb remain adrift. 54km to go: The breakaway has been caught and the peloton are taking a bit of a breather. I’m going to take one too and will be back in five minutes. King of the Mountains: Michael Schär takes the second of two sets of two KOM points available on the Côte de Rimiez today.Whoever of he and Fabien Grellier crosses the finish line first today will take the King of the Mountains jersey. 58km to go: Team Jumbo-Visma move their riders to the front of the bunch that is about to swallow up the breakaway. At the back of the field, NTT rider Giacomo Nizzolo is visibly struggling and being pushed along by a team-mate. He doesn’t appear to have crashed, but is really struggling. 63km to go: Stage favourite Caleb Ewan is also out the back of the field after crashing. Our leading trio drop Fabien Grellier. Michael Schar (CCC) and Cyril Gautier (B\u0026ampB) lead the stage as they tackle the second and final climb of the day. There’s an awful lot going on. 64km to go: The gap between pour three-man breakaway and the bunch is down to 30 seconds. Pavel Sivakov from Team Ineos is pedalling along four minutes behind the bunch and looks throughly disillusioned after his two crashes. Is he going to quit? 67km to go: David De La Cruz, Luisleon Sanchez, Mikel NIeve and Andrey Amador are among to those to have gone down in that most recent crash. 69km to go: There’s another crash in the peloton on the Preminade Des Anglais, where today’s stage will finish, with a lot of riders hitting the deck hard. More on that when they’ve sorted themselves out. This is a seriously attritional start to this year’s Tour. 70km to go: The riders are back on the Promenade Des Anglais in Nice. Team Ineos rider Pavel Sivakov has fallen for the second time. Having received medical treatment to the right side of his body following his first fall, Egan Bernal’s mountain domestique is now receiving treatment to the left side of his body. He looks seriously fed up with life. 87km to go: Julian Alaphilippe misjudges a bend as he tries to bridge the long gap between himself and the bunch and almost goes off the road. He sticks out a leg to help keep his balance. 90km to go: Deceuninck-Quick-Step rider Julian Alaphilippe suffers a mechanical when his front wheel seizes up and needs a bike change. He has to wait pateitnly at the side of the road for his team car to get to him. As the rain continues to hammer down, the three stage leaders have a lead of 1min 39sec. 94km to go: Team Ineos rider Pavel Sivakov is at the back of the field, making his way through the team cars with blood visible on his arm after hitting the deck in these treacherous conditions.Mitchelton–Scott rider Daryl Impey has also come a cropper. The peloton are 1min 10sec behind the breakaway group and moving at snail’s pace as they tackle a series of hairpins on a road covered in surface water. Jeremy Whittle is reporting on this year’s Tour for the . Here he wonders if Groupama-FDJ rider Thiubaut Pinot can end France’s 30-year wait for a winner. 102km to go: It’s raining heavily and the road is very slippery as the breakaway trio of Michael Schar (CCC), Fabien Grellier (Team Total Direct Energie) and Cyril Gautier (B\u0026ampB Hotels–Vital Concept) make their way back out the country. They have a lead of 1min 25sec over the peloton, which is being led by the riders of race favourite Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo-Visma team. 107km: Fabien Grellier takes the first two King of the Mountains points up for grabs on the Category 3 Cote de Rimiez. It’s a climb the riders will tackle again with 59 kilometres of today’s race left to go. 107km to go: The trio in the breakaway tackle a stiff climb, the gap between them and the bunch down to 1min 43sec.

He described Gertrude’s coin-sized implant as “a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires”.Musk co-founded Neuralink in 2016 with the goal of creating a wireless brain-machine interface, something scientists hope can help cure neurological conditions and allow people with paralysis to control a computer mouse.In July 2019, Neuralink unveiled a design that involved implanting tiny electrode “threads” into the brain as well as another device behind the ear. The new device Musk described on Friday is much smaller, does not require the visible ear device, and would be implanted in the brain by a surgical robot under local anesthesia.The device is removable, Musk said, and he showed off another pig, Dorothy, whom he claimed had had one of the devices implanted and subsequently removed. “What Dorothy illustrates is that you can put in the Neuralink, remove it, and be healthy, happy and indistinguishable from a normal pig.”While most of the near-term practical applications of wireless brain-machine interfaces are medical, Musk has also expressed a desire that such devices could help human intelligence compete with artificial intelligence, which he considers an “existential threat”. At Friday’s event, the entrepreneur made a number of outsize claims about the potential capabilities of the technology, including that it could be used to summon a Tesla, play video games, or allow a person with a severed spinal cord to walk again.Musk did not present any scientific data to support his claims about the pigs or the devices.Neuralink has raised more than $150m in funding, including $100m from Musk himself. The company employs roughly 100 people, but could soon expand to 10,000, Musk said at the event.Musk also said that Neuralink had achieved FDA Breakthrough Device designation in July, a program that can help expedite the regulatory process for products “that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions”. Such a designation does not mean the device is approved by the FDA.Neuroscience experts say that while Neuralink’s mission to read and stimulate brain activity in humans is feasible, the company’s timeline appears overly ambitious.“Everyone in the field would be very impressed if they actually showed data from a device implanted in a human,” said Graeme Moffat, a University of Toronto neuroscience research fellow.Small devices that electronically stimulate nerves and brain areas to treat hearing loss and Parkinson’s disease have been implanted in humans for decades.Neuroscientists have also conducted brain implant trials with a small number of people who have lost control of bodily functions due to spinal cord injuries or neurological conditions such as strokes. Humans in those trials could control robotic limbs or small objects, such as a computer keyboard or mouse cursor, but have yet to complete more sophisticated tasks.Most of the current cutting-edge research in brain-machine interface is conducted on animals, scientists note, with safety challenges and lengthy regulatory approval procedures preventing larger human trials.Notably, Musk, who has been a frequent source of misinformation about coronavirus in recent months and fought to keep his factories open during the pandemic, did not wear a face mask during his presentation, despite being in a room with dozens of employees, a camera crew and veterinary staff. He eventually put on a mask during a question and answer session."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6adb722af0cf8631e342d83a32cad0d13e24d30e/385_436_6013_3608/master/6013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6c9efa091ab5cfac06dc1b9d594fcf6","title":"adam buxton dad more proud of me but he was","story":"The podcaster, comic and radio host has made a career out of his insecurities. But uncovering a family secret has helped him find peaceThis is the third time I’ve met Adam Buxton, but the first time I’ve met him on his own. Our first encounter was in 2001, alongside his childhood best friend and frequent comedy partner, Joe Cornish. Back then, they were making the Channel 4 comedy series The Adam And Joe Show, in which the two of them brilliantly, and with often astonishing prescience, satirised pop culture: in a segment titled The 1980s House, they sent up a then-nascent obsession with nostalgia TV (“Early mornings on television in the 80s were very different from today: there were only three and a half channels, all showing popular comedy rodents”) they recreated revered films and sitcoms with stuffed animals (Toytanic! Furends!). It was silly, smart and superbly of its time, and for a certain demographic – ie mine – The Adam And Joe Show remains some of the greatest TV comedy ever made.I next met him 12 years later, this time with his father, Nigel. A former travel editor for the Sunday , Nigel was also regular guest BaaadDad on The Adam And Joe Show, where Buxton and Cornish riffed on Nigel’s conservative persona, getting him to review, witheringly, the Prodigy singles and Tribal Gathering. BaaadDad was beloved by fans, but by the time we met he was a frail 89-year-old, his son now protecting him rather than directing him, gently helping him up steps and prompting his memory. As for Buxton, he seemed a little lost, with Cornish now pursuing a film career (he wrote and directed the sci-fi comedy Attack The Block, and co-wrote The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn). I worried Buxton would be condemned to that graveyard for comedians, a panel show career.Which brings us to today, when, for the first time, I am meeting Buxton on his own. Except he’s not on his own at all, in his lovely house in Norfolk, drinking tea in his picture-perfect kitchen with his wife, Sarah, and their three delightful children. He asks me to keep details of his home and family “vague”, so let’s just say that any enemies are definitely unvindicated: Buxton, 51, has a very nice life. His dark beard is now striped with white like a badger’s back, but he seems otherwise unchanged, except, perhaps a little more calm, a little more content.We are talking in the flat attached to Buxton’s recording studio, which is filled with his father’s furniture. Nigel died in 2015, several months after he came to live with Buxton and his family. Something of a hoarder, his oldest son, who “definitely shares that tendency”, can’t bear to throw away his father’s things. So, on a lovely summer’s day, the two of us sit in what is undeniably an old person’s flat, my feet on a needlepoint footrest. Behind Buxton is a bookcase filled with his father’s books. All around us are photos of Nigel. “I thought, well, this could be a cool place for my children to hang out,” he says, but then adds, “I’m worried it’s slightly mad that I’m building this weird museum in here.”It is a bit mad. But Buxton’s new memoir, Ramble Book, does a lot to explain it. He had been approached to write books before, but always jokey high-concept books. After Nigel died, he decided this was something he could write about “from the heart, and hopefully make it funny”. Even so, he initially avoided what he describes as the “dead Dad” part, sending his editor comedy lists and standalone pieces about train journeys. “Just finding ways not to bare my soul,” he explains. But his editor pushed for more soul, and the best sections of the book are the ones about his father.“Nigel was an older dad and had a very old-school way of dealing with the world,” says Cornish, who has known Buxton since he was 13. “The way he flirted with waitresses, the way he talked about wine – it was really funny. Then he would fly off the handle, and that was funnier to me than it was to Adam.”Nigel had always said his father, Gordon, was “an estate overseer”. But after he died, Buxton discovered Gordon was a servant and Nigel a self-made man. Thanks to Gordon’s employer, Nigel was sent to grammar school, “where he got on his social mobility scooter”, moving on to a boarding school and later Oxford. “It wasn’t that he was a phoney,” Buxton says, “he definitely became the person he was. But he was embarrassed by his background.”Though Nigel played the part of the posh toff well, the edifice supporting it was shaky, not least because he insisted on sending all three children to boarding school. When he lost his job at the Sunday , the scaffolding came crashing down. One of the most painful moments in the book is when Buxton finds a snooty letter from the  to Nigel, rebuking him for not paying back a loan they’d given him (“paying for private school is laudable… but frankly it would seem a folly looking at your figures”). Even more poignant is the copy of a letter his father sent to one of his most cherished friends, David Cornwell, better known as John le Carré. Nigel knew Cornwell from university and, at 66, begged his friend for a £40,000 loan. Cornwell sent a “kind, well-worded refusal”, and Nigel later took his youngest son, David, out of his public school, Haileybury.“That was the thing that really crushed him. I found his notebook after he died and it was semi-coded, and the code he had for feeling depressed or like a failure was ‘Haileyburyitis’. I felt terrible for him because, really, Dave’s totally fine,” Buxton says.The letters had been carefully preserved in an envelope on which Nigel had written: “Financial crisis, of interest to anyone should they come to write my life story.” “I think he had that journalist’s mindset: keep notes, keep everything,” Buxton says. “But really, I think he was preserving his own legend, as I do, too.” The discovery made him re-evaluate their relationship: “I always thought he was disappointed that I was letting the side down.” It turned out to be more complicated.Buxton went to Westminster school in London, but was never especially academic, botching his A-levels, retaking them and getting into Warwick University, only to drop out and go to art school. When he started out in TV, he avoided any reference to private school in interviews, and squirms a bit even now. “After Dad died, I thought about how hard that must have been for him, when I didn’t do especially well academically, how important all that had been to him…” He trails off. All around us is the paraphernalia his father kept to project an image of educated poshness. This was what Nigel wanted to bestow on his children, and his eldest son first rejected and now preserved it.If Nigel’s money troubles didn’t bite until after Buxton left school, they lurked in the background. Cornish remembers that Buxton used to “get a bit angry… And I think that was probably because of the disparity between the very privileged world around him, and what was happening with his dad.” Louis Theroux, another of Buxton’s schoolfriends, recalls the same tension. “Adam was never into weed, but Joe and I were and we’d be all mellow. Adam would drink beer and he’d get all grrrr.”Neither is surprised he’s written a memoir. “He was always interested in making sense of his inner life. At school, he loved what he called ‘deepies’,” Theroux says, referring to Buxton’s then-word for deep conversations.“He’s kept every video, every bit of ephemera, every scrapbook,” Cornish agrees. But even this doesn’t prepare me for his archive. When he shows me into his studio-barn, the first thing I notice is a stack of drawers, each carefully labelled with the names of his schools, his art college, his friends, all dated. There are not just reports and essays, but old travel cards and birthday cards. Huge bookcases contain thousands of CDs and cassettes, including the kind most of us threw out in 1997 (“Dance Mix 17!”). Multiple shelves are set aside for recordings taken from baby monitors when his children were little, each one carefully labelled. I haven’t even mentioned the piles of diaries and old invites. Why keep all this stuff?“Partly self-importance and vanity. Also, it became this party trick, because every time people came round I could go, ‘Remember this?!’ It was like having a pocket time machine,” he says. Plus, he says, “I’m just frightened of not having anything to show for it all at the end.”Buxton’s parents had a fractious relationship. “It was uncomfortable sometimes to see how harsh my dad could be with my mum,” he says. They split up soon after their youngest child left home. Nigel occasionally half-joked about coming to live with him, and Buxton would “shudder at the thought”. But when he was diagnosed with cancer, Buxton moved him in, thinking it might be a chance to get to know his father. But Nigel was not really a man for deepies and Buxton ended up being his carer, checking he took his pills, helping him when he became incontinent.Buxton took in his mother, Valerie, earlier this year. By that point, her memory was starting to go, but one phrase she repeated was, “You did such a great thing, taking in Daddy, because he’s a difficult man, you know.” She died this spring. She had been “totally fine” with Buxton writing a book about his father, he says, but when he rereads it now, “I realise it was Mum who was always my ally. That’s one of those things about families: the people you have the trickier relationship with are the ones who make the bigger impression. The ones who really love you, you end up taking for granted.”He had already finished his book when his mother started to get ill. But he talked about her death in a moving episode of his podcast this summer, and the person he invited on was Cornish. After some banter about the TV they’d been watching in lockdown, Cornish asked how Buxton was doing. “Not that good,” Buxton replied, and the two embarked on a proper deepie. Recalling his mother’s last day with them, Buxton cried. Cornish knew when to offer reassurance, when to stay quiet and when to start making jokes again it was the sound of someone getting their best friend through their worst time.While Buxton and Cornish have both found success inidually, for a certain kind of fan (me), the real joy comes from listening to them talk to one another, as on their former XFM and 6 Music shows. They have the kind of joyful, natural conversational style that only comes from a 40-year friendship between two people on the same wavelength. They started making films together when they were teenagers – including my personal favourite, one of Buxton, Cornish and Theroux dancing to Groove Is In The Heart when they were about 20.Channel 4 gave them their own show when they were only 27, after Buxton entered some of their videos into a talent competition. But making it put some strain on the friendship Buxton would agonise over tiny details, for example spending days making curtains the viewers would hardly see. “There were sometimes whole sections of the show that were left blank, even just a week before transmission, because it was a bit Adam had to do, and he would get furious if you mentioned it,” Cornish says. “And then he’d deliver it and it would be amazing. That’s why the podcast is so perfect for him – he can control everything.”They quarrelled occasionally there were, Buxton says, some “uncomfortable conversations in wobbly voices”. More painful was when Cornish decided to stop co-hosting their 6 Music show, to focus on film-making. “All my insecurities were tweaked,” Buxton says. Did they ever properly fall out? He is horrified: “We preferred to manage our resentments in private rather than confront them. We always got on when we met up, and within three minutes we’d be laughing about some bad film we’d seen. Then we’d not see each other for a while, because I was in Norfolk and he was between London and Quentin Tarantino’s pool house and Steven fucking Spielberg’s bouncy castle.” He adds: “In case it’s not clear, that was mock envy with a very tiny pinch of truth.”He has always been “Mr Emotional”, as he puts it, whereas Cornish is more teasing, and at times on the radio you could hear Buxton’s hurt bafflement at his friend’s blunter comments. Buxton recalls that soon after they left school he asked Cornish if they’d still be friends in 10 years. “I don’t know, man, probably not,” he casually replied. Thirty years later, the comment burned enough for Buxton to put it in his book.At the end of the audio version of Ramble Book, there is a conversation between the pair in which Cornish brings up that comment, which he had long forgotten: “I think I was probably looking for the most provocative answer. My brain issues the true standard answer and then thinks, well, that’s a bit boring, what would be more interesting?” You can hear Buxton gasp, re-evaluating 40 years of casual banter. “I think the relationship worked creatively because we are very different, but I never understood that,” he says now, smiling. Buxton’s emotional openness is surely partly a reaction against his father despite being sent to boarding school when he was nine, I have rarely met a man less afraid to show his vulnerabilities. Another reaction against his father is Buxton’s marriage. He and Sarah have been married for 19 years, after meeting through another school friend. “She looked like Sean Young in Blade Runner, and we were both a little oversensitive, so we bonded. Also, she’s tall. Joe’s tall, Louis’s tall, I do seem to be attracted to tall people because I’m short.” It was Sarah who forced him to look at how harsh his father could be to his mother. “At first I was defensive, but then I understood that she just doesn’t want me to turn out like that,” Buxton says.Our interview has very much turned into a ramble chat. When I first arrived at his house, I worried that Buxton was weighed down by the past. But now it feels more that he simply surrounds himself with happy memories he loved his parents, he loves his friends – why shouldn’t he keep mementoes from them?Plus, there are clear benefits to being able to relive the past. Buxton always knew his father was baffled by his interests – that was the whole joke of BaaadDad. Recently, he has been watching old outtakes from The Adam And Joe Show. “We shot absolute hours of stuff with my dad, making him go to places that he hated, and he was always game. It was heroic. I used to think, ‘Why isn’t he more proud of me?’ But he was proud. I can see that now.” • Ramble Book by Adam Buxton is published 3 September (HarperCollins, £16.99, or £14.78 from the bookshop)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b4faf313a74be95f5f195b786526f7a07e42d5/0_110_5483_3290/master/5483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b05a5901e17846e467d9cdf95a2a37b","title":"michaela coel isnt buying anything new oxfam second hand september","story":"From Chewing Gum to I May Destroy You, the writer and actor has carved out a groove as a true original. Who better to convince us all to shop secondhand?Michaela Coel could be wearing anything she wanted, right now. As the star and creator of I May Destroy You, the BBC drama that became a water cooler hit even in a summer without water coolers, Coel is the hottest property in town. Any fashion designer would jump at the chance to dress her. But today she is enthusing over a time-pummelled black sweatshirt with faded insignia, sourced not from a Bond Street boutique but from Oxfam’s cavernous warehouse in Batley, North Yorkshire. “I’m here for it,” she murmurs approvingly, pulling it over her head.She’s here for all of it. She’s here for the pale pink Burberry trenchcoat, another Batley treasure unearthed for our shoot by Oxfam’s senior fashion adviser, Bay Garnett, a nod to Coel’s neon bubblegum bob as Arabella in IMDY. She’s here for the dynamite 80s jeans and matching jacket in toffee-apple faux-leather, a rare Gaultier Jeans find. She’s here for the Fanta-coloured boilersuit (think Ripley in Alien meets Bananarama on Top Of The Pops), for the elegant 70s Jaeger mustard blazer with anchor-stamped gold buttons, and for a knockout pair of Versace high-waisted shorts, illustrated with classic Rita Hayworth film posters.Coel has a distinctive, three-tiered expression, when she is introduced to someone new. Instantly recognisable from screen, it is even more mesmerising in real life. She opens her eyes extra wide, drops her mouth slightly open for a moment, the high planes of her cheekbones catching the light, before veering into a mile-wide smile. The combination of split-second comic timing and diamond-cut bone structure is dynamite, and Coel has the whole studio transfixed. Ahead of our shoot, she has asked not to be interviewed about her work, because she is feeling talked-out on the subject. Instead she is here to lend her star power to a cause, as the face of Second Hand September, an Oxfam campaign to encourage people to pledge not to buy new clothes for the entire month.Think of it as dry January for clothes addicts. Oxfam hopes that the campaign, now in its second year, will establish itself on the calendar in the same way. In normal times, September is the month when summer dresses are packed away, and the trend cycle reboots – hence those hefty September issues of the glossy magazines, full of new-look wishlists. Second Hand September takes this principle of the wardrobe reset and reframes it, challenging consumers to find new looks with old clothes instead. Last year 62,000 people, including Vivienne Westwood, Rachel Weisz and Paloma Faith all signed up.Coel has long taken an independent approach to fashion, wearing a dress made with Ghanaian kente cloth for her first red carpet moment, the 2016 Baftas. (She won two of the three categories in which she was nominated for her breakout series, Chewing Gum.) So when she was approached by Oxfam, Coel says, she “felt compelled to add my voice to this cause. I hope it raises awareness and encourages us to reflect on our buying habits. Small changes can have a huge impact on the environment – and, in turn, the fight against poverty.”On set, Coel’s phone blasts out an eclectic mix of music. Sixties soul singer Barbara Lewis pops up in between new tracks by Californian band Thee Sinseers and female British rap artist Lex Amor. The clothes Garnett has chosen, likewise, are cool and contemporary, even when they are decades old. “Nothing looks more contemporary than great thrift stuff,” Garnett explains. “When you get it right, it doesn’t look retro at all.”The clothes on the rail today are taken from 1,500 pieces she handpicked to stock an Oxfam “luxury pop-up” at Selfridges in London, which opens on 7 September. “I’ve got a brilliant flying jacket. I’ve got a print that could be Prada. I’ve got three great Ossie Clarke dresses and an incredible 1970s sequin gown with a tiger at the hem. But with Oxfam price tags.” In a premium space on the second floor – slap bang next to Prada, Celine and Balenciaga – the shop will be “almost like a fake luxury store,” says Garnett, “with all the bells and whistles of that space. Marble, velvet, lots of room.” (Selfridges is funding the fit-out.) “Look, first of all, it’s fun,” she says. “I’m not here to lecture anybody. But I do sort of hope people do a double-take.”Garnett has championed secondhand clothes as high-fashion catnip all through her 20-year styling career. For the May 2003 edition of British Vogue, she put Kate Moss in a banana-print leotard top and white denim shorts, both thrift store discoveries. Her friend Phoebe Philo, then designer at Chloé, saw the magazine, called and asked to borrow the top, and the look became the inspiration for Chloé’s spring 2004 collection – followed by most of the British high street.When she worked at Vogue, the then editor, Alexandra Shulman, used to tell Garnett that she had a knack for making designer clothes look as if they came from a charity shop. Garnett recounts this as if it were a prized compliment to her, secondhand is always best. She pulls out herringbone tweed coats to enthuse about the linings, turns silk blouses inside out to coo over the seams.“Secondhand has always felt to me like a more empowering way to shop,” she says. “I like that I’m opting out of the system a bit. I love fashion but I want to do it my way, without being dictated to by big brands with all the money and marketing power.” In her Oxfam role, she adds, it feels “empowering in a more urgent way than ever, because it is tied up with the environment and with clothes being sold to raise funds to help the poorest people in the world. I love the idea of old clothes being that powerful.”Coel would agree, and worked with costume designer Lynsey Moore on the wardrobe for both Chewing Gum and I May Destroy You with a similar principle in mind. “Right from the start, Michaela knew she wanted to use as much secondhand and sustainable clothing as possible,” Moore says. “That suited me because most of my own clothes are from charity shops and vintage stores. Vintage clothes have the best stories.”The fixed point of Arabella’s look was the pink wig, which appeared in the original script. “So I looked out for pink and purple pieces that would tie into that,” says Moore, “to make it feel like the clothes are part of her.” The bold, graphic print cardigan which Arabella wears for her powerful take-down of Zain at the writers’ summit came from Moore’s own wardrobe, bought from a vintage store in London’s Soho. “We could have gone with something more obviously authoritative, but this was more Arabella,” says Moore. She and Coel added shoulder pads to the cardigan for a more powerful silhouette.The current trophy piece in Moore’s own wardrobe is a black denim jacket with collar and pockets intricately embroidered with pearls. “I won it on eBay for £2.50 and I’m obsessed with it. Charity shopping on eBay – that’s my Sunday night treat,” she says. “Designer labels matter if you are looking for resale value, but I shop secondhand by looking at colour and fabric.” She recommends taking a friend with you, “because this is an activity, not just a purchase. It should be fun! Oh, and take a tape measure. If you know your waist measurement, you can see instantly if a pair of trousers will fit you. Saves a lot of time.” If you don’t know where to start, Moore’s tip is to look out for silk shirts: “A good silk blouse in a great colour or print will never let you down. You can wear it tucked into jeans, or layered under a jumper, or loose over a bikini – in 15 years’ time, you’ll still be wearing it.” On set, Coel has pounced on a rose-embroidered mohair sweater with this season’s puff sleeves. It is quirky, but also very now – a lot like her, in fact. And the pandemic has made Coel’s cheerleading for Second Hand September even more urgent. The closure of 600 stores, and the cancellation of major fundraising events including the London marathon and Glastonbury, saw Oxfam lose £5m per month during lockdown. This is dire, at a moment when a global economic downturn threatens the welfare of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. If there is to be a silver lining, it is in the possibility of a post-lockdown reset, as consumers decide not to return to the bad old ways of overconsumption.Every September, the world is looking for a fresh start. A new look, even. But this year, it could be in old clothes.• Find out more about Oxfam’s Second Hand September campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269d11de6177e95b4c3d137e047777c6afae4cf1/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c21c60599fadc79bc138eb6766d23bf","title":"march washington dc racism get your knee off our necks","story":"Tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington DC on Friday, demanding criminal justice reform and voting rights following a summer of protests against systemic racism and against police treatment of Black people.The Get Your Knee Off Our Necks march, announced in early June following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, also marks the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr gave his “I have a dream” speechurging racial equality.Thousands gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, many wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts, as speakers demanded racial equality and an end to police brutality in the US.“We get less healthcare, like we don’t matter,” said the civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network organization was one of the event organizers.“We go to jail longer for the same crime like we don’t matter. We get poverty, unemployment, double the others, like we don’t matter.“We’re treated with disrespect by policemen that we pay their salaries like we don’t matter. So we figured we’d let you know, whether we tall or short, fat or skinny, light skinned or dark skinned, black lives matter.“And we won’t stop until it matters to everybody.”King’s son, Martin Luther King III, was among those to speak, telling the crowd they must “defend the freedoms that earlier generations worked so hard to win”.Friday’s event comes ahead of a November election expected to see a record number of mail-in ballots, and with a Republican party seemingly opposed to making it easier to vote.“We must vigorously defend our right to vote because those rights were paid for with the blood of those lynched for seeking to exercise their constitutional rights.”The Democrat-controlled house of representatives has passed legislation making voting more accessible in 2019, and recently renamed the bill the John R Lewis voting rights act. The Republican controlled Senate has refused to act on the legislation.Organized by the civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton’s National Action Network and groups including the NAACP and the National Urban League, the speakers at Friday’s rally also highlighted police brutality and the need for reform.The Washington march comes days after Jacob Blake became the latest in a series of Black people to suffer brutal treatment at the hands of police.Blake was shot in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, and remains in hospital. His family said on Tuesday that Blake had been paralyzed from the waist down.Speaking on Friday, Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr, said: “There are two systems of justice in the United States. There is a Black system and a white system and the Black system isn’t doing so well. I’m tired of looking at cameras and seeing these young black and brown people suffer.”Blake’s sister, Letetra Widman, said Black people were done “catering to your delusions”.“America, your reality is not real,” Widman said. “We will not pretend. We will not be your docile slave. We will not be a footstool to oppression.”Widman also called on protesters to continue to march peacefully. “You must fight, but not with violence and chaos – with self-love,” Widman said. She called out loudly: “Black men, stand up. Stand up, Black men, and educate yourselves.”The families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, all Black people killed by police or by iniduals on the extremist fringes who regarded themselves as vigilantes.The march was organized amid protests over the killing of Floyd.The 46-year-old died after a police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including the final two minutes when Floyd was unconscious.“The reason why George Floyd laying there with that knee on his neck resonated with so many African-Americans is because we have all had a knee on our neck,” Sharpton told USA Today.The march was set to be the largest political gathering in Washington since the coronavirus outbreak began to escalate in March.The thousands of participants streaming in for the march on Friday morning stood in lines that stretched for several blocks, the Associated Press reported, as organizers insisted on taking temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols.Organizers reminded attendees to practice social distancing and wear masks throughout the program.The march will be matched by demonstrations in states which have a high Covid risk, NAN said, including in Montgomery, Alabama and Las Vegas, Nevada.The NAACP is hosting a “virtual march” throughout the day.Speakers will include the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, from Michigan, and Stacey Abrams.A group of protesters are due at the march who have walked all the way from Milwaukee to the nation’s capital for the event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446b49e874a0c2e8b2d0cebf60713eca92f3f725/0_141_4239_2543/master/4239.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=733d6131c31998b08badd7ddc22029e4","title":"back to school in covid times what can pupils in england expect ","story":"Shorter days, bubbles, alfresco meals and staggered arrivals among measures introducedIt has been a summer of painstaking preparations for headteachers charged with drawing up plans covering everything from new behavioural rules to “Covid-secure” measures before millions of pupils in England return to the classroom full-time next week.Many schools will look different, with spray-painted stencils marking out 2-metre distancing outside, duct tape arrows signalling one-way systems in corridors, forward-facing furniture and desks with clip-on screens so teachers can get closer to younger pupils.What else does the new normal involve for schoolchildren?Many schools will stagger arrival and leaving times and lunchtimes to reduce crowding, resulting in shorter days for some and longer days for others. One mother of three said her four-year-old would have 90 minutes less school time a day. School populations and building sizes are also constraining the use of the bubbles designed to restrict Covid-19 outbreaks. Instead of keeping small groups separate so a limited number of children have to self-isolate in the event of an outbreak, bubbles may be hundreds-strong. At Exeter Road community primary school in Devon, which has around 200 children in its main building and 30 to 50 on a nursery roll, building work has put a third of space available out of action. “If you were going to have pure bubbles then surely each one would have toilet facilities of its own, so we are going to have four fairly large bubbles as a result and we’ll be trying to keep them separate, with staggered entry times,” said the headteacher, Paul Gosling.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, implied this week that parents should avoid lingering at school gates, saying they should drop their children off and “get on with the tasks of the day”.With some canteens off-limits and plans for some classes to eat lunch in the rooms they will be spending much or all of the day in, some schools will use apps to enable children to order their meals.Among schools trialling the app is Hampton High in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, where the headteacher, Rebecca Poole, says enormous changes have been made. “We’ll be operating a food delivery service from the canteen as we can’t have large numbers of children eating together at the moment, and that’s where the app from our catering company comes in,” she said. Payment would normally be made via fingerprint recognition, but this has been replaced by lanyards.Schools such as Birchwood High in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, have installed outdoor decking under a shelter so that children can eat outside. The principal, Chris Ingate, said: “We have a big indoor cafeteria, but we wanted to make provision for eating outside. It’ll be a bit like going to Costa, you’ll go in and then out, but we’ll have to see how things are in the winter months.”Headteachers pause or take a deep breath when asked the million-dollar question: are you clear on what you’re supposed to do in the event of an outbreak?“It’s not entirely clear what will happen if there is an outbreak, but it’s not for want of trying,” said Ruth Davies, the head of Waunarlwydd primary in Swansea and the national president of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT). Schools have procedures in place for what to do immediately in terms of the isolation of pupils or staff, but whether an entire school or just a bubble would be sent home remains to be seen.Poole said: “Once we’ve isolated the person, made the phone call home and recommended they get tested, it’s somewhat unclear. My view is that test and trace will pick it up and we’ll be advised, but all I can say is that we’ll just have to deploy our professional judgment.” Plans are being made at her school for teachers quarantined at home to stream lessons into the classroom if needs be.With confidence in the government’s track-and-trace scheme at a low ebb, some schools have drawn up rudimentary forms to detail who shared rooms with whom. They include High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool, where the head, Mark Trilling said: “I think in reality if someone does come down then in our case the entire bubble of 30 would go into self-isolation. It is a bit confusing and there is no real guidance, but we would draw on our own professional judgment and take advice from the local authority.”Poole and other school leaders say no one can tell when schools might be able to start thinking about relaxing some measures, but she predicts it won’t be for another nine months.“There’s a bit of concern about timetabling, but we will stick with what we’re doing because what children and parents need is clarity,” she said. “We won’t change anything until at least January, and I think we will have to go until at least March.”Davies voiced concerns about staffing, and said the coming six months could be hardest as winter takes its toll. “As soon as we have any semblance of a symptom then that person will be off, and if one or more members of staff go then there will be pressure. A steady stream of supply teachers just won’t be available.”Gosling said he feared a chaotic autumn term with teachers and pupils being sent home in large numbers and a lack of political leadership.Ingate said his main concerns were students who had fallen behind over the last few months, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as the “whole unpredictability” of Covid-19 and the potential for a second wave.“What happens? We’d take would advice from our local authority and health bodies, but I have an instinct that it would probably play out in terms of an increased incident rate in the area rather than the school being the centre. If rates went up, we’d see it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b54d823d93979d747cf5c50d65a5367bec10475/0_0_5408_3245/master/5408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58a08e1db70c1f5114ed4dbf28224639","title":"europe holiday resorts foreign tourists magaluf staycationers","story":"Typical holiday destinations across Europe are seeing an influx of a new type of visitor: local staycationersIt is usually the domain of hangover-nursing sunbathers and rowdy tourists getting an early start on beach parties. But this year – as quarantines, restrictions and advisories take a toll on travel – the white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters of Magaluf on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca have some new visitors: Mallorcans.“This is the first time we’ve ever come – Mallorcans do not come to Magaluf,” laughed Laura, 31, as she settled in for a day on the beach with her friends. “We came this year only because we knew there were no tourists.”It’s a scene playing out across Europe as locals reclaim sites ceded long ago to throngs of tourists. Plazas once filled with the sounds of suitcases rattling over cobblestones now ring with children’s voices, while near-vacant landmarks offer locals an intimate experience of the top sights in their backyards.Earlier this year Mallorcans began quietly spreading word of a nearly deserted, picture-perfect beach, resulting in a stream of locals traipsing out to Magaluf.“I would have never brought my daughter here before,” Consuelo Merchante told the news website Ultima Hora. It was her first time visiting Magaluf’s beach in four decades. “We stayed away because of the British tourists,” she said.The novelty of being a hometown tourist, however, comes at a steep cost. In Magaluf and across tourist sites in Europe, the backdrop is one of shuttered shops and hotels, hinting at the devastating economic impact of the plunge in tourists.“It’s bittersweet,” said Vesna Celebic, a tour guide in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. In recent years locals had resigned themselves to sharing the walled old town with millions of visitors, enduring the relentless arrivals of mammoth cruise ships and the clatter of helicopter tours overhead.Then the pandemic brought these drawbacks into sharp relief. “At the moment it’s wonderful,” she said. “The old town is definitely the place that the locals reclaimed. Now you see a lot of kids riding bikes and playing soccer in some of the public squares, you hear the locals again. You hear the local language.”Still, the dire reality facing the tourism-dependent city was unescapable. Celebic had just wrapped up her fifth tour of the season, when normally she would have racked up 100 or so at this point. “The things is, there is this economic disaster looming upon us,” she said.In Italy, cities and beaches usually thronged with foreign tourists have become a draw for Italians. Locals have flocked to the Riviera Romagnola, a stretch of golden beaches overlooking the Adriatic sea.“With the advent of low-cost flights to foreign destinations, young Italians had preferred to spend their holidays in Spain or Greece,” the deputy mayor of Rimini, Gloria Lisi, told the .But the pandemic appears to have reversed this flow, with the riviera now playing host to a crop of first-time visitors. “This summer, Rimini is crowded with people in their 20s who come from neighbouring regions. This hasn’t happened for decades.”The chance to take in some of the world’s best art without elbowing through crowds has been a draw for some. “Morning at the Louvre to take advantage of the lack of tourists,” author Mira Kamdar wrote on Twitter last week. “Paris as we Parisians rarely get to experience it.”In Barcelona, which before the pandemic was receiving an average of 155,000 visitors a day, arrivals have slowed to a trickle. “Tourism had been pushing out residents, in some ways,” said Arlene Bayliss, a marketing professional based in the city. “Now it’s the reverse: it’s tourists that get lost among the locals.”She is now seeing the city in a new light, marvelling at the ability to snap photos alone on the steps of the city’s cathedral, or use the time she had once spent navigating a sea of tourists to focus on the city’s stunning architecture.The lack of visitors, coupled with the departure of city residents on August vacations, has emptied the usual tourist haunts such as the Gothic quarter. “You can wander through and there’s not a soul,” she said. “Then you come across a plaza filled with locals and kids playing. It’s very different.”The situation has demonstrated what is at stake for cities and other hotspots in striking a balance between attracting tourists and catering for local residents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59751834340e0c7330cf844ffc47edd63452124f/0_26_3350_2011/master/3350.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=575ddb18cd5fa8026e36ebbe3d23863f","title":"extensive local lockdowns needed uk winter matt hancock covid 19","story":"In worst case Covid-19 scenario England will need ‘very extensive’ measures Nationwide restrictions and “very extensive” local lockdowns could be introduced in England this winter in the event of a second wave of coronavirus, the health secretary has said.Social-distancing measures would also remain in place for the foreseeable future, Matt Hancock said, with grandchildren unable to hug their grandparents at Christmas unless a vaccine is approved.Speaking to the Times, he said a second wave of Covid-19 was a very serious threat that other parts of the world were already witnessing.“But so far in the UK we are managing to keep the number of new cases flat through a combination of test and trace and local lockdowns,” he said.“This is the reasonable worst-case scenario, that we have a bad flu and a growth in coronavirus as people spend more time indoors. Cases go up again, and we have to use very extensive local lockdowns or take further national action. We don’t rule that out but we don’t want to see it.”Hancock’s comments come as restrictions for more than a million people in north-west England were due to be eased, following a drop in coronavirus cases.Restrictions on seeing friends and family will be lifted from next week in the Greater Manchester boroughs of Bolton, Stockport and Trafford, as well as Burnley and Hyndburn in Lancashire.People in parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire will be able to mix with other households from Wednesday, but the measures will remain in place in large parts of Bradford, Halifax, Dewsbury and Batley.Following Hancock’s warning of potentially severe local lockdowns in winter, Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, urged the government to stop imposing decisions from London without negotiating with local leaders.Burnham said the government had overruled local authorities in Greater Manchester and Bradford, splitting up communities by keeping some under restrictions and not others.“You then have the situation where some people on one half of the street are under restrictions and others not,” he told BBC Breakfast.“Imposition of decisions like this without agreement or negotiation is absolutely the wrong way to go. With the health secretary warning today of extensive lockdowns throughout the rest of this year, I think communities everywhere should be worried.“This has to be partnership between national and local government.”Burnham also said the role the government had given MPs in relation to local lockdowns meant that political considerations were being brought into play.“We need a much better process for agreeing these things,” he said. “These decisions should be driven by public health alone, not politics.”The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood has said draconian action could be needed if the public do not stick to social distancing rules, hinting that the government could take stronger action than local lockdowns.He told Times Radio: “If the nation, if iniduals aren’t following the rules then ultimately ... we cannot break the chain of spread and therefore draconian action is required to take place.“We’d prefer it to be local but absolutely, if that R-rating does go too high, this is a warning for every single listener: ensure that you do socially distance so we can actually contain it.“This is an enduring emergency, I repeat. Until there’s a vaccine this is the new normal that we’ve got to get used to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c6865e8884c4c367deeda2fddbc789dfe21fd4f/0_143_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0831e557d843e060b46e48986ba3620","title":"france records exponential increase in covid 19 cases","story":"Figure of 7,379 infections is highest number of new cases in 24 hours since height of epidemic at end of MarchFrance has suffered an “exponential” increase in Covid-19 cases with 7,379 new infections in 24 hours, according to the country’s public health authority.The number of new cases has been growing steadily throughout August, but jumped from 6,111 positive tests on Thursday and 5,429 on Wednesday.Friday’s figure, the latest published by Santé Publique France, is the highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since 31 March at the height of the epidemicHistorical data from the government’s Covid-19 website suggests it is the second highest since health authorities began to report the figures on 2 March.The number of new patients admitted to hospital, 241 in 24 hours, remains relatively stable as does the number of admissions to intensive care, which rose by 34.French ministers admitted during a long press conference on Thursday that the August surge in Covid-19 infections could not be solely explained by an increase in testing, currently running at around 840,000 a week. The health authorities aim to reach 1m tests a week by the end of September.Santé Publique France reported that “the dynamic of transmission is growing strongly and is very worrying”. There has been an increase in the number of infected people showing Covid-19 symptoms – as opposed to half being asymptomatic, as was reported the previous week. While all age groups are reportedly affected, the authorities say there is a continuing increase in cases among young adults, many of whom show no symptoms.The rise comes at the end of the long summer holidays and just before la rentrée, the return to work and school across France next week.

The deputy editor, Tagdual Denis, told BFM television on Saturday that the image was not designed to wound Obono, and denied that it was an attention-getting ploy. But he added: “What I regret is that we are always accused of racism ... we are politically incorrect, it’s in our DNA.”Anti-racism activists said the publication reflected a creeping acceptance of extremist views, fuelled by social media.Prime Minister Jean Castex, a former member of the Republicans party, tweeted: “This revolting publication calls for unambiguous condemnation... The fight against racism will always transcend our differences.”Elisabeth Moreno, the junior minister for equality and the only black member of the French government, tweeted: “I don’t share Danièle Obono’s ideas, but today I offer her all my support.” A similar refrain came from politicians from multiple parties, including the treasurer of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party.There were multiple protests in France in June and July against racial injustice and police brutality inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd’s death at the knee of police in the USs.French President Emmanuel Macron, a centrist who raised eyebrows when he gave an interview to Valeurs actuelles last year, has pledged to root out racism. But he also insisted that France will not take down statues of figures linked to the colonial era or the slave trade, as has happened in other countries in recent months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed44f5ce9fbc9ed5de87fc7e2cc4d7247e008c6f/0_248_5574_3344/master/5574.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8d8d48d3d26762fb58f40638d929510e","title":"riots rock malmo after far right swedish activists burn quran","story":"Leading imam condemns violence after police battle more than 300 on streets of the cityThe disorderly phalanx of young men and teenagers, many wearing face masks and hooded tops, started to accelerate, excitement rising, as it neared the row of police vans blocking off the troubled district of Rosengård in Malmö.“We’re gonna fuck this system up because they want to let a man burn the Qur’an,” one of them yelled, as the group starts hurling jagged chunks of concrete paving towards the armoured riot police sheltering behind the vans. “And we’re gonna fuck the police.”More than 300 rioters threw stones at police and burned tyres in the southern Swedish city on Friday night after a video circulated of followers of the far-right Danish politician Rasmus Paludan burning a copy of the Qur’an near one of the city’s mosques.Crowds of young men wielded bars taken from street signs and metal barriers, and threw stones and fireworks after smashing up bus shelters. Further up the road, cars, tyres, pallets and rubbish bins were set ablaze.Police in Malmö had vacillated for two weeks over whether to give Rasmus Paludan, the leader of Denmark’s extremist Hard Line party permission to hold an anti-Islamic protest. Permission was denied on Wednesday, Paludan was stopped in a car on Friday afternoon as he left the Öresund bridge, deported and banned from entering Sweden for two years.But this did not stop his supporters from filming themselves burning one copy of the Qur’an, and kicking another around Malmö’s main square like a football, for which three of them were arrested on suspicion of hate crimes.During the riot, Samir Muric, a prominent Malmö imam, paced up and down in the space between the police and the rioters, imploring the rioters to stop and accusing them of shaming their own religion. Muric, who was dressed in Islamic robes, has also condemned the rioters on his Facebook page. “Those who are acting in this way have nothing to do with Islam,” he wrote. “Their shouts filled with ‘la ilaha ill Allah’ and ‘Allahu Akbar’, are just outbursts that they do not mean, because if they really meant them, they wouldn’t have acted like this.”Among the spectators, it was clear that many of the Muslims and Arabs among them opposed the riot. “I don’t like this, because the Arabs, they’re fucking things up for our community here in Sweden, because one Danish man burned a Qur’an,” complained one man, who grew up in Malmö to Lebanese parents. “And this is what he wants. They want us to be like this. I’ve never seen this ever in my life. I’m shocked.”Another young man, blocked from returning to his home in Rosengård at the end of a 10-hour shift, struggled to contain his frustration:“A maximum of five of them are Muslim. You know why? Because a real Muslim doesn’t do this. All religions, not only Islam, are about peace.”Throughout the night, police held their position at the crossroads marking the iding line between Rosengård and central Malmö, pushing the rioters back with a series of charges.“Look at them, they can’t fight back fire with fire, that doesn’t work!” a young man, who called himself “the Somali pirate of Rosengård”, hooted in a strong north London accent. “They’re violating our civil rights by letting other people burn the Qur’an that we believe in and now we have to show that they can’t do that. It’s against us, so we’re against them. That’s how simple it is.”According to Patric Fors, a press spokesman for the Malmö police, calm had not returned to the area until about 3am on Saturday: “A few policemen have been slightly injured, and I don’t have any reports of any members of the public being injured. We currently have 13 suspects wanted for rioting, five of them have been arrested, but they have all now been released.”Many witnesses expressed their worries about how the Qur’an-burning and the angry reaction to it might change the city.Amar Mohsen, an 18-year-old whose mother is Russian and whose father is Iraqi, said politicians in the city should have done more to condemn the plans to burn the Qur’an. “The politicians in Sweden say: ‘It’s a human right. Do what you want. You live in a free country. You can burn a Qur’an in front of a mosque’. It’s not like that. It will affect many people and I think we will be more ided.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb430cbe4d4e716841303249afbfca20a726232/0_45_5438_3263/master/5438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc97ddf5e6f8ac96e0febe0f8b3c8374","title":"coronavirus live news cases continue to soar in europe as victoria sees fewest in two months","story":"Demonstration against coronavirus curbs gets go-ahead for German capital Australian state records 18 deaths and 94 cases India records 76,472 new cases.

Relevant updates and tips from readers are always much appreciated, you can get in touch via Twitter @JedySays, or via email.Below is a summary of the latest coronavirus news from around the globe:• Berlin police disbanded a mass protest in the German capital against coronavirus curbs a few hours after it had begun because marchers failed to keep their distance and wear masks as instructed. The protest came as infections rise across Europe and as public frustration at measures to contain the virus grows in some quarters. Similar events took place in Paris, London and elsewhere on Saturday.• A further six people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 29,547, NHS England said on Saturday.• Coronavirus has killed at least 838,271 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Saturday. At least 24,795,760 cases have been registered. Of these, at least 15,976,700 are now considered recovered. The US is the worst-hit country with 181,779 deaths from 5,918,381 cases. At least 2,118,367 people have been declared recovered.•South Korea has recorded its 16th consecutive day of triple-digit rises in new coronavirus cases, heightening fears about a shortage of hospital beds in Seoul.• In England, nationwide restrictions cannot be ruled out should there be a rise in coronavirus cases this winter, the health secretary said. Matt Hancock also hinted that restrictions may not be eased over Christmas to avoid an “uptick” in the number of Covid-19 cases.• France reported a jump of 7,379 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours according to the Public Health France figures released on Friday evening. This is the highest figure for new cases since 31 March. A historic check of the government’s Covid-19 website suggests it is the second-highest since the figures began to be reported by the health authorities on 2 March.Myanmar reported 77 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, the south-east Asian nation’s biggest daily rise, amid a recent resurgence of the virus after weeks without confirmed domestic transmission. On Wednesday Myanmar also reported 70 new cases. The health ministry did not immediately say where the 77 new cases were found. Most recent infections have been in Sittwe, the capital of conflict-torn Rakhine state, where authorities have imposed a lockdown and curfew. Myanmar’s outbreak has been relatively small compared with other countries in the region since it found its first case in March, with only six deaths and 733 infections reported so far.In England, Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the new government guidance should have been received “months ago”. She said: “It is simply unacceptable that this guidance was altered immediately on what is a key issue for schools - what to do when pupils are found to have Covid-19. As it stands currently there is still no clarity on what should happen in a school where there is an outbreak. “This does not build confidence in government’s competence to keep schools safe when it scores such an own goal. “The NEU wrote to the PM on 10 June proposing an education recovery plan which anticipated much of what is in this guidance. The key difference, however, is that our plan required government investment. Yesterday’s government plan leaves schools to go it alone if they have to organise remote learning. “This is simply not good enough. Remote learning requires significant extra resources, both in IT provision for students without laptops and internet access, and more teachers - like those working in schools cannot manage a full teaching timetable and plan for remote learning at the same time. “In the end, this advice is better than none at all. But only just.”Berlin police on Saturday disbanded a mass protest in the German capital against coronavirus curbs a few hours after it had begun after marchers failed to keep their distance and wear masks as instructed. The protest came as infections rise across Europe and as public frustration at measures to contain the virus grows in some quarters. Similar events took place in Paris, London and elsewhere on Saturday. “Unfortunately, we have no other option,” Berlin police said on Twitter, adding people had failed to comply with the safety conditions of the march.Protesters were dispersing peacefully although there were some pockets of disturbance, such as a construction container fire and blocked roads, police said. Some 3,000 officers had been deployed to control crowds estimated at 18,000. Police had been preparing for possible violence as activists opposed to measures to contain the virus urged social media followers across Europe to arm themselves and gather in Berlin. Earlier this week the city banned the protest but a German regional court overnight gave the final go-ahead by overruling the earlier decision. Until now Germany has managed the coronavirus crisis better than many of its European counterparts, with rigorous testing helping to hold down infections and deaths. But new daily infections have accelerated in recent weeks, as in much of the world. On Friday, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged citizens to keep up their guard against the virus. “This is a serious matter, as serious as it’s ever been, and you need to carry on taking it seriously,” she said. Protesters had gathered before the Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin ahead of the march with signs reading: “Stop the corona lies” and “Merkel must go”. About 200 anti-mask activists held a rally in Paris to protest against sanitary measures with slogans such as: “No to the health dictatorship” and “Let our children breathe”. In London, several hundred demonstrators gathered in Trafalgar Square calling coronavirus a hoax and demanding an end to lockdown restrictions. Many carried banners saying “Fake News,” or “Masks are Muzzles” and rejecting any mandatory vaccination programmes. The virus has killed more than 40,000 people in Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquoLoss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalities"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe health authorities want to avoid a second national lockdown but the measure could not be ruled out if there was a surge in the spread of Covid-19, according to one of the country’s leading public health experts.Dr Cillian de Gascun, the chairman of the National Public Health Expert Team (NPHET) advisory group said the reintroduction of stay-at-home restrictions would be avoided “if at all possible”.It followed a warning by the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Wednesday that the country was close to a second national lockdown because the State was at “a tipping point”.A further 127 cases in the State were confirmed on Friday. This brings to 28,578 the total number of cases of the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and leaves the death toll in the Republic at 1,777.Of the cases confirmed on Friday, 52 are in Dublin, 13 are in Monaghan, nine are in Tipperary, eight are in Meath, eight are in Wexford, eight are in Roscommon and the remaining 29 are located in Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Offaly, Waterford, Westmeath and Wicklow.Around 80 per cent of the cases are people under 45 years of age, while 70 of the confirmed cases are men and 57 are women.Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s Brendan O’Connor Show on Saturday, Dr de Gascun acknowledged the country was at a “critical phase” as the Government waited to see the impact over the next week of additional national restrictions on the gathering of people imposed last week.“It’s really important that people continue with the enhanced measures and the enhanced public health guidelines,” said Dr de Gascun, who is also director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory.However, he said the reintroduction of a national lockdown could not be ruled out as the stay-at-home restrictions had been shown to work in suppressing the spread of Covid-19.“It’s a tool in the armoury that you never exclude definitively,” he added.Dr de Gascun acknowledged that a lockdown while effective in controlling the virus had a very significant impact on the Irish economy and people’s mental health.He said NPHET was very conscious that the planned last phase of the reopening of the economy, which included pubs, had not been able to go ahead because of Covid-19 levels in the community.Dr de Gascun said the way people went to pubs in the past was one of the highest risk environments for the spread of the virus but that there might be measures that the industry could put in place to reopen safely.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said there was a €16 million package being made available for pubs that were being prohibited from reopening next week.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said on Friday there would be enhanced enforcement powers for pubs and restaurants after an increase over the summer in the number of non-complaint premises.She said with the sanction of a superintendent a gardaí can order the closure of a pub for one day, and if there is still no compliance with this seven days, and then 30 days.Mr Varadkar said he could not say with any certainty whether pubs would reopen this year.Further regulations are being considered by the Government which would see workers in premises that serve drink and food be obliged to wear masks.The Cabinet also agreed to ask the Attorney General to examine options for further regulating house parties. Under the proposals discussed by the Cabinet on Friday afternoon, it will be an offence to organise or attend a gathering in a private house with more than six visitors either indoors or outdoors. This measure was introduced as a guideline last week.Ireland’s case incidence surpasses SwedenMeanwhile, the incidence of Covid-19 cases in the Republic has surpassed the level in Sweden for the first time since the start of the pandemic.Updated figures published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on Saturday show that the infection rate in Ireland over the past 14 days is 32.3 per 100,000 compared 28.9 per 100,000 in Sweden.Health authorities have focused on figures from Sweden as the country adopted a softer approach to combating the virus, although it has experienced comparatively higher infection rates and death rates than neighbouring countries like Norway and Finland.The highest current rate of infection is in Spain where there are 205.5 cases per 100,000 over the past fortnight, with the heaviest concentrations in the northern part of the country.Other countries with current high infection rates are Romania, Malta, Croatia and France.Almost 2.17 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported in EUEEA countries and the UK to date.Spain has the highest number of cases at 439,286 followed by the UK (331,644), France (267,077) and Italy (265,409).Ireland is ranked 12th in the most number of cases, although it is only the 22nd most populous nation among the 30 European countries whose figures are collated by the ECDC.Ireland also has the 12th highest number of deaths linked to Covid-19 at 1,777.The total number of deaths in the EUEEA and the UK has reached 181,531 with the largest single number in the UK at 41,486.Italy has the second highest number of deaths at 35,472, followed by France (30,596), Spain (29,011) and Belgium (9,886).Ireland still in the first waveAsked where Ireland was in the course of the pandemic, Dr de Gascun said he thought the State had interrupted the first wave through the introduction of stay-at-home restrictions and “the fantastic effort by everyone in the country”.While it was difficult to know exactly from a virology perspective, he said he believed Ireland was still in the first wave as there had not been any significant change in the virus.Dr de Gascun said it was “disappointing but not hugely surprising” that the summer weather did not have any great effect on the virus.“So really people’s behaviour is what we have to count on to control it for the coming months until we do have an effective treatment or hopefully an effective vaccine in the next year,” he added.He praised the public for taking the public health message to heart so well and for “continuing to do the right thing the majority of the time.”Although a significant second surge of Covid-19 could be expected in the winter season, Dr de Gascun expressed confidence that the ongoing use of physical distancing, hand hygiene and wearing face masks would have an impact on all respiratory viruses, including the flu, over the coming months.He pointed out that Australia had already experienced a very mild influenza season because of all the public health measures that had been in place to combat Covid-19.“I think it’s important that we reassure people, to a degree, that we can control this,” he added.Dr de Gasucn said there was no major difference between a zero Covid policy - the elimination of the virus rather than its suppression - and the one being pursued by the Government.“Ultimately you want to suppress the virus as much as possible in the community while allowing people to get back to school and to get back to work and to protect our vulnerable,” he said.As Ireland was an open economy which was impacted by the stay-at-home restrictions, Dr de Gascun said the aim was to reopen society as much as possible.However, he stressed that people needed to be aware that aspects of daily life needed to be done in a different way and that such a required change in behaviour that could last for several years.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the

care products has confirmed is to close its facility in Ballinasloe, Co Galway, with the loss of 115 jobs.Aptar said it was ceasing production at the plant in December following a review of its Irish operations.The company said its industrial equipment and machinery would be transferred to other facilities around the world between September and November.Aptar, which has headquarters in Illinois in the United States, employs over 14,000 staff across its operations in 18 countries.Although employee representatives at the plant in the IDA business park in Ballinasloe had put forward alternatives to the plant’s closure, Aptar said they did not meet the company’s criteria for making the necessary changes to address changing market conditions and competitive challenges.In a statement, the company said: “Aptar management do not take these decisions lightly and will uphold our core values and treat all employees with dignity and respect as we support them through this difficult change.”The company, which has operated in Ballinasloe for over 20 years, said it would meet employee representatives to assist staff with social measures including extended healthcare insurance and retraining and outplacement support.“We are committed to giving employees all the possible means to help them find new employment,” it added.News of the closure was not unexpected as Aptar had signalled in the summer it intended implementing cost-saving measures across its global operations with a particular focus on its manufacturing facilities.The Co Galway factory produces pumps and dispenser systems for perfume sprays and other beauty products.During the Covid-19 pandemic, it has also been making hand sanitisers.The plant had normally operated on a 247 basis but had scaled back its output significantly over the past few monthsSinn Féin TD for Roscommon-Galway Claire Kerrane said news of the closure was “hugely disappointing”.Ms Kerrane said she was calling on Tánaiste and

convention","story":"A defiant Donald Trump has accepted the Republican nomination for a second term as US president with a scathing attack on rival Joe Biden.

Photograph: Brendan Smialowski The Republican National Convention culminated on Thursday night with Donald Trump’s acceptance of his party’s nomination for the presidency, bringing to a close the four-day event. Here are some highlights of the week.The Reality TV ShowDespite reports that Republicans were ill-prepared for the mostly virtual convention, the Trump campaign pulled off an impressive feat. As a former reality TV star, Trump is attuned to the power of television – two producers of The Apprentice were involved in planning the convention – and the result was a slickly produced event. Each night opened with a glossy video montage, scored by lush strings and a voiceover by actor Jon Voight, the father of Angelina Jolie who received the National Medal of Arts from Trump last year.The People’s HouseDonald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, may have coined a new phrase for her father – the people’s president – but much of the controversy this week surrounded the use of the White House. The People’s House, as it is colloquially known, is not supposed to be used for partisan political events, but this week we saw Trump harness the full power of the presidency for political means. Melania Trump delivered her speech from the Rose Garden, and Trump hosted a naturalisation ceremony for five immigrants who were sworn-in as American citizens. It later emerged some of the participants did not know that they would feature in the Republican convention. \u0026nbspBut it was Thursday evening’s closing event that attracted most censure, as approximately 1,500 guests, exercising no social distancing, gathered on the South Lawn to hear the president accept his party’s nomination, culminating in a lavish fireworks display and opera performance.A Family AffairWhen the Republican National Committee unveiled its one-page policy platform on the eve of the convention, it was clear that the Republican party had become the party of Trump. In a break with previous elections, the party did not produce a new policy platform, but rather published a resolution pledging to “continue to enthusiastically support the president’s America-first agenda”. This week saw the president lean heavily on his own family for endorsements as many of the big names of Republican politics stayed away. All four of his adult children spoke at the event, as well as his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and his wife, Melania. His son’s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, delivered one of the most memorable speeches of the week, dramatically declaring to an empty hall that “the best is yet to come”.The Middle GroundWhile Trump’s support with his core base of supporters remains steady, this week saw an effort by the president’s campaign to reach out to wavering voters – particularly women and people of colour. The convention heard from several African-Americans, including Alice Johnson, the grandmother whose life sentence in prison ended after Trump granted her clemency, and Kentucky’s attorney general Daniel Cameron who attacked Joe Biden for his controversial “you ain’t black” comment, which suggested that black people could not vote for Donald Trump. “You can’t tell me how to vote because of the colour of my skin,” he said. \u0026nbspSimilarly, several prominent women spoke at the event, including White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, in a not-so-subtle effort to appeal to suburban women voters, a constituency in which Trump is struggling. In a bid to personalise the president, they relayed anecdotes about Trump’s character. Their message was clear – you may not like some of Trump’s language and use of Twitter, but it’s okay to vote for him in November.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspLaw-and-Order PresidentIf Donald Trump was the star of this week’s convention, his Democratic rival Joe Biden was cast as the bogeyman. Trump mentioned Biden by name more than 40 times in his somewhat rambling acceptance speech. “No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” he declared, a phrase that neatly encapsulates what promises to be Republicans’ attack line in the next few months. The fact that this week’s convention coincided with an eruption of urban unrest in Wisconsin following the police shooting of Jacob Blake may have benefitted Republicans, who have been keen to stress their law-and-order credentials.\u0026nbsp While the effort to focus on police funding may be an attempt to deflect from the coronavirus pandemic, the message may well resonate with some of the suburban voters who swung towards Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, but whom Republicans are hoping to win back. Contributions from ordinary Americans who lost loved ones to crime were some of the most powerful moments of the week. \u0026nbspFull coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eat help loophole meant diners could save 180 meals","story":"An Eat out to Help Out loophole meant diners could save up to £180 off meals, the  has discovered, as the Treasury admitted it is powerless to stop gaming of scheme.People eating out under the scheme were able to cheat their way to bigger discounts by asking to pay for each course separately, and claim a discount of up to £10 per person for each.This means that a table of six could have saved up to £180 if they each claimed the full discount for a three course meal.The scheme gave diners up to £10 off food and soft drinks on Mondays to Wednesdays throughout August and ends on Monday.Several restaurants told this newspaper that they had been asked to process bills for each course separately by customers, although most said they had declined to do so.A Treasury source said there was nothing in the rules of the scheme to prevent such gaming of the system and the trade body UK Hospitality said it was aware of diners using the loophole to boost their savings. A Treasury spokesman urged the public to “respect the spirit” of the scheme.The emergence of such a loophole will fuel fears that the cost of the offer could be over-inflated. Figures released earlier this week revealed that, as of August 23, the total amount claimed for was £336m.John O\u0027Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers\u0027 Alliance, said:  This scheme is in danger of egregiously eating into taxpayers\u0027 pockets.  “While action was needed to reopen the restaurant sector, subsidies like this produce unintended consequences by distorting spending decisions and quickly running up big bills which taxpayers will eventually have to pay off.“Instead of meddling in our meals, ministers should stay away from these schemes in the future.”Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: “Asking to be billed separately for inidual courses is not against the system. Businesses can claim back the money anyway, so, in theory, everybody benefits if the discount is applied that way. “It might cause administrative headaches for some businesses, though. So, it is a good idea if customers talk to the business, ideally when they make their booking, to explain that’s how they want to be billed.”Another loophole identified by the  was when diners craftily chose to eat a different course at multiple venues throughout the night, therefore saving far more money had they stayed in one place and met the £10 cap.Another pub in central London witnessed customers coming to take advantage of bar snacks and starters before heading to have meals in the West End. The landlord told The  that one such reveller had a cheap seven-course lunch by taking advantage of this method.A spokesman for the Treasury said: “The Eat out to Help out scheme is designed to protect jobs and the figures indicate it is working – with over 64 million meals claimed for since it launched.“We encourage people to respect the spirit of the scheme.”Ms Nicholls said it had been a “great success” and pointed out that many restaurants are planning to continue with it voluntarily into September, without the support of the Government.However, she warned that most would be too “financially vulnerable” after months of lockdown to continue offering discounts.She said a formal extension would “keep customers excited about going out and give businesses the support they still need”.Among the restaurants which are voluntarily extending the scheme are the Gilbert Scott and Aqua Shard in London, Perdu Perdu in Manchester and New Chapter in Edinburgh. Oakman Inns will also extend its discounts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"falkland islands unique history has left rich valuable carbon","story":"Vast peatlands could provide up to £47 million worth of carbon offsets every year for the Falkland Islands if they are restored, a new study has suggested. When European explorers arrived at the Falklands in the late 18th century, they found an almost untouched scrubby landscape, home to colonies of sea lions, birds, and little else.It may not have looked like much. But without human and mammal intervention to disturb the land, and with the addition of the fertilising effect from the droppings of native animals, the islands had developed into possibly the most peat-rich place in the world. Around 40 per cent of the Falklands are peatlands, according to Professor Chris Evans of the UK Centre for Hydrology and Ecology, compared to 12 per cent of the UK. Restoring them could prove to be a valuable income stream, as well as improving local bioersity and potentially putting the islands on a path to negative emissions, making them a world leader in climate change mitigation. Peatlands are one of the most carbon intensive landscapes in the world, storing more carbon per hectare than a tropical rainforest. But peatlands that have been degraded can become a source of greenhouse gas emissions. Peatland around the world currently emits 3 million tonnes of CO2e a year, but has the potential to sequester 14 million tonnes of CO2e annually. The introduction of agricultural livestock by settlers and 250 years of subsequent grazing and burning has depleted the Falklands’ vast stocks of peat. Native tussac grasses, which are vital for peat formation, were displaced. These impacts mean that the islands’ capacity to continue forming peat and sequester carbon has decreased, as has the habitat for globally important wildlife, including penguins, albatrosses and sea lions, for which the Islands are famous, said Mr Evans. Restoring them could save up to 1 million tons of CO2 a year, according to a new study from UKCEH.   It could also prove valuable to the local community, as restoration projects could be sold as offsets to companies keen to reach their goals of net zero emissions in the next ten to 30 years. The researchers say the restored peatlands could be worth up to £47m a year to farmers and landowners, based on the UK government’s estimates for the future value of carbon offsets. “With its small population and vast peatland areas, the Falklands have the potential to become one of the world’s first ‘carbon negative’ societies by managing their natural landscapes to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. said Mr Evans. Restoring the peatland would require changing agricultural practices, and reintroducing the native tussac species of grassland, and would require the support of local farmers.You\u0027ve got this carbon rich resource, Mr Evans said, and hopefully there\u0027s opportunities there to hopefully bring in additional income to the farmers there in a different way.It could also improve the habitat for the Islands’ penguins, albatrosses and sea lions. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british museum wont get away pandering wokeness","story":"Some years ago a friend of mine was standing outside the British Museum. A tourist approached him and asked “Where is the British museum?” My friend signalled to the large, pillared building behind him. “No, sorry – where is the British museum?” the tourist repeated. The friend, fearing he had encountered a simpleton, reiterated that it was the rather large, unmissable building behind them both.At which point the tourist revealed that he was far from simple. “No, sorry. This is a museum of Babylonian monuments, Egyptian artifacts, Greek archaeology. But where is the British museum?” It was a great and revealing question. Most national collections involve a showcase of the best things produced in that country. But the British Museum is different. It is a museum of world civilisation.Intermittently, this fact comes back to bite it. Such has been the case this week. For a growing chunk of our society now regards the past principally as a fertile ground for grievance hunting. Off across the millennia they roam, searching through the savannahs of injustice precisely because they are so sure to find it.In recent weeks, this movement has flashed an eye at the British Museum. For in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, an increasing number of people are talking about reparations and the repatriation of treasures like the Benin Bronzes to their places of origin. Certainly this isn’t a new debate, but it is now happening at a time of heightened rhetoric. People and institutions finding themselves in the way of BLM are right to want to get out of the way pretty sharpish.So it is with the British Museum. Earlier this week the bust of Sir Hans Sloane was removed from its pedestal. While the museum was keen to hold onto the collection that he bequeathed, they were less keen to be seen to revere someone whose fortune was partly acquired through slavery. But clearly the museum’s director – Hartwig Fischer – knows where all of this could lead. It is a “simplification” he said this week, to think that a collection of 13 million objects should be regarded as stolen goods that should all be returned to their rightful owners.Maybe. But until people like Fischer explain what is good about their institutions – how they have preserved the world’s culture, rather than “raiding” it – their collections will remain in the sights of the vengeful, and may yet be stripped bare.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab pressure intervene lawyer held croatia lifting","story":"Dominic Raab has come under pressure to seek the release of a whistleblowing lawyer who lifted the lid on a multi-million pound bribery scandal at a Monaco-based company.Margaret Hodge, chair of the anti-corruption parliamentary group, has written to the Foreign Secretary to urge him to intervene to halt the extradition of Jonathan Taylor to Monaco after his arrest in Croatia on charges sparked by the Monaco company.It came as Mr Taylor’s children, Will, 15, and Abby, 17, handed in a letter to Monaco’s Prince Albert at its embassy in London pleading for him to intervene to secure the release of their father.Mr Taylor, 51, has been trapped in Croatia since his arrest last month when he arrived in Dubrovnik for a holiday with his wife, Cindy, and three teenage children.The Croatians acted on an Interpol arrest warrant from Monaco in which he was accused of blackmail in what his lawyer, Toby Cadman, claimed was an “abuse of process” that cynically by-passed the British courts.Mr Taylor helped the FBI, Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and investigating agencies in Holland and Brazil expose multi-million pound bribes by senior staff at his former Monaco-based employer SBM to secure contracts for drilling platforms in the oil industry.   His actions led to SBM paying out more than $500 million to settle court actions with investigating agencies and the prosecution of senior former executives at his company.In a letter to Mr Raab, Ms Hodge, a leading Labour MP who previously headed the powerful public accounts committee, said: “The public rely on the bravery of whistleblowers but far too often, they suffer from vengeful action by their former employers. “To encourage whistleblowers to speak out they must be given the appropriate protection. Failure to do so would make others less willing to come forward to expose serious crimes and so undermine the fight against corruption.“In view of the high-level corruption that Mr Taylor has exposed and the information he has provided to law enforcement authorities in the UK, the Government must act urgently to stop his extradition and bring him home. “Cross-border retaliation against this whistleblower must be firmly rejected to send the strongest of signals that the UK will not kowtow to the crooked and corrupt.”In the letter to Prince Albert, Cindy, Mr Taylor’s wife, wrote: “These charges against him are utterly incomprehensible.“We, as a family, implore you to do the right thing and have the extradition request and charges against my husband dropped promptly so he can come home  to his family.”Mr Taylor, now a freelance legal contractor based in Southampton, left SBM in 2012 but was then accused of extortion as he tried to negotiate a compensation settlement for his loss of earnings from blowing the whistle.  SBM, which did not admit guilt in the settlements, subsequently told The  it had dropped any legal action against Mr Taylor. The extortion claims were thrown out of court after the firm offered no evidence.  The Monaco prosecutor’s office is, however, pursuing him over the allegations but they have not been spelled out to Mr Taylor apart from the warrant claiming “extortion and blackmail.”It has refused to answer questions from The .Abby, his daughter, said: “What has happened to my dad is unjust and wrong.  What he did 6 years ago took immense courage and bravery yet now he is being wrongfully accused of something he did not commit.  “Monaco is a transparent and regulated country and I have absolute faith in the Monaco judicial system and urge them to withdraw their request for extradition and drop all charges against my father so he can come home to us.”Mr Taylor and his family’s appeals are being backed by Protect, a whistleblowing charity, human rights and international whistleblowing charities and Michael Woodford, the chief executive who blew the whistle on a scandal at Olympus.Mr Woodford said: It seems to be a sinister trend of whistleblowers being pursued many years after their whistleblowing.

He is to be awarded the Dickin Medal later this year. Pinned down by grenade and machine-gun fire during a compound assault, the elite troops were unable to move without taking casualties.Without hesitation, Kuno charged through a hail of gunfire to tackle the gunman, breaking the deadlock and changing the course of the attack, allowing the mission to be completed successfully.During the assault Kuno was wounded by bullets in both back legs. He was given life-saving treatment by his handler and by medics in the back of a helicopter.His injuries were so severe he required several operations before he was stable enough to fly back to the UK. Part of one of Kuno’s rear paws had to be amputated to prevent life-threatening infection. Kuno returned home on an RAF plane, receiving in-flight care from a Royal Army Veterinary Corps team. He was transferred to the Defence Animal Training Regiment in Melton Mowbray, Leics, where he underwent extensive reconstructive surgery, overseen by Professor Dick White, one of the world’s leading specialists in canine surgery.He has become the first UK military working dog to be fitted with custom made prosthetic limbs.Kuno, who was on his second deployment when he was injured, is the first UK military dog to be fitted with such devices. Lightweight and fully bespoke, they enable him to run and jump as he wishes. He is said to be thriving in his new home in the west country.Colonel Neil Smith, the Chief Veterinary and Remount Officer, said: “It is important that Military Working Dogs receive a high level of care if they are unfortunately injured, and Defence has military vets and vet nurses to ensure animals receive the care and rehabilitation they deserve”.The Peoples Dispensary for Sick Animals (now known as PDSA) opened its first hospital in 1917. Since then it has treated millions of sick animals in the UK.The Dickin Medal was introduced by PDSA’s founder, Maria Dickin, in 1943. It is recognised as the highest award any animal can achieve while serving in military conflict. Kuno will become the 72nd recipient of the PDSA Dickin Medal. Previous recipients include 34 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, four horses and one cat.The PDSA Dickin Medal is a large, bronze medallion bearing the words “For Gallantry” and “We Also Serve” all within a laurel wreath. The ribbon is striped green, dark brown and sky blue representing water, earth and air to symbolise the naval, land and air forces.British special forces are still active in Afghanistan, partnering local forces in the fight against remnants of al-Qaeda.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Without Kuno, the course of this operation could have been very different, and it’s clear he saved the lives of British personnel that day. This particular raid was one of the most significant achievements against al-Qaeda in several years.“Kuno’s story reminds us not only of the dedicated service of our soldiers and military dogs, but also the great care that the UK Armed Forces provide to the animals that serve alongside them.”Former Royal Marine dog handlers injured during their service have set up a dog hydrotherapy treatment centre to rehabilitate animals. Pawseidon, based in Poole, Dorset, treats injured dogs in a five by four metre pool or a treadmill in a water tank. They say the warm water and slight current that can be generated by submerged jets is ideal for helping injured animals or those recovering from surgery.The canine therapists sometimes play classical music and reggae during sessions as they found the sound can have a noticeable calming effect on some dogs.When the  recently visited Pawseidon Nicky Stazey, from Poole, had brought her four-year old Great Dane weighing 90kg to the centre for treatment on inflamed joints. She said treatment in the pool to build up muscle tissue had clearly alleviated Thor’s suffering.“When I first brought him he was literally hiding behind me,” she said. “But he’s come on leaps and bounds. His confidence is through the roof at times…he’s fantastic.”James Hill, 38, was shot multiple times in December 2013 during an operation in Afghanistan which left him with arthritis in his hip and a lower leg injury. He lost his military working dog, in the same action and eventually had to leave the Royal Marines due to his injuries having endured 16 operations.He said: “Seeing dogs hurt now and seeing what we can do with the properties and power of water, it’s unbelievable.“What we do now is a bit pink and fluffy, but it’s all about having a passion for animals and the satisfaction of helping dogs.“There’s a communication you have with animals through therapy and helping them and you can see that they really benefit from that and warm up to you.“Even in pain dogs will stay loyal to their owners. They are stoic in their whole recovery journey and I really admire that.“Dogs are great at reading our emotions and acting on them to comfort their owners, which in turn helps owners overcome that battle back to fitness.”As James observed: “There are other ways to skin a cat”.In 2019, Kuno deployed as a Canine Protection and Detection dog in direct support of specialist UK and host nation forces. Operating in mountainous, unforgiving and dangerous areas, Kuno had conducted 16 operations over a 5-month period. He was a pivotal member of the team and always held on high alert. His role was to detect explosives, find hidden weapons and incapacitate the enemy if so ordered. Where he led, the team were happy to follow, safe in the knowledge that he had cleared the route.In May 2019, Kuno deployed on an operation. The enemy was expected to be well armed, well prepared and willing to fight to the death. Kuno and his handler were among the first off, the helicopter. As they raced across the open ground towards the compound, they immediately came under a burst of machine gun fire. Miraculously, no one was injured. The assault team entered the compound, where Kuno was released to incapacitate an insurgent. He did so successfully, and then switched focus to detection, soon discovering a variety of hidden weapons and explosives in the compound. Kuno returned to his handler and the team continued their mission, moving towards another set of buildings. Suddenly, several grenades detonated in close proximity to the team and a burst of machinegun fire came through a doorway adjacent to the force. Another enemy insurgent, equipped with a Night Vision equipment, had concealed himself in a compound courtyard and was shooting at the assault force as they approached. Pinned down by accurate fire, the assault force was unable to move without sustaining casualties. Kuno’s handler, confident in the dog’s ability, relied on him to break the deadlock. Kuno did not hesitate and raced through the doorway to attack the insurgent. Surprised by the speed and aggression of Kuno’s assault, the insurgent fired wildly into the darkness at the shape bounding towards him.  Unfortunately, several rounds found their mark, and Kuno received bullet wounds to both hind legs.  Undeterred, and barely breaking stride, Kuno launched himself at the insurgent, biting his arm and wrestling him to the ground. The insurgent was quickly incapacitated, but despite his wounds, Kuno continued to attack to maintain the advantage. Kuno’s actions had altered the course of the battle the assault force swiftly entered the courtyard, neutralised the insurgent and cleared the remainder of the building. Only then did Kuno relent.Kuno was given immediate first aid, and was evacuated with the assault force, receiving life-saving care on the back of the helicopter. His injuries were severe one bullet narrowly missed a main artery and he required several lifesaving operations in theatre before he was stable enough to return the UK. Kuno’s injuries have proven life-changing and his rear paw could not be saved and was soon amputated. His loyalty, upbeat character and courage were ever-present through a prolonged period of rehabilitation and, despite his injuries, he has recovered well and is in good spirits and health.Kuno was a most invaluable team member. His instinctive courage and determination unlocked the stalemate and undoubtedly saved the lives of multiple coalition soldiers. The operation resulted in the most significant success against Al Qaeda for several years Kuno was fundamental in this. His recovery is on-going and he has been retired as a MWD. Kuno’s actions during this operation, and throughout his career, are utterly deserving of the PDSA Dickin Medal.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"leo mckinstry schools reopening militant teaching unions","story":"After the long summer holidays, it signies hope at the chance of fresh beginnings and excitement at the prospect of change.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesNext week, the new term will have greater meaning than ever for pupils, professionals and parents. At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all.

So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message.

He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed. How the Government’s ineptitude created a lost generation.”As Theresa May’s former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb put it: “Is there anyone more damaging to the BBC’s reputation for impartiality than Lewis Goodall ”I’ve read the thinly veiled left-wing think piece so you don’t have to.Goodall’s main thesis is to try to link the Covid-created A-level exams situation to the Windrush scandal.If it had been written by Owen Jones in the , I’d understand.But a full-time BBC staff member who we are consistently told is an impartial journalist, with no bias against the Government  Puh-lease! We cannot suspend our disbelief any longer.One thing Newsnight does best is sanctimony.We saw it again this week as the show’s editor, Esme Wren, planned to host a navel-gazing session at the Edinburgh TV Festival called Reporting Racism: TV Journalism And Black Lives Matter.Only problem is that Newsnight, for all its left-wing posturing, is the most middle-class, white news broadcast on the box.In fact, an investigation by the Mail on Sunday revealed the programme has NO non-white presenters and has been nicknamed NewsWhite behind the scenes.So a bunch of privately educated, rich, privileged members of the London liberal media elite — the very definition of champagne socialists — are on a nightly basis doing untold harm to the reputation of the BBC.But it’s too late now, the damage is done.The BBC hates everything we love about Britain.They are repelled by patriotism. They cannot stand anyone who dares not vote Labour or Lib Dem. They will never forgive Brexit voters for destroying their European fantasy.And they fetishise Nicola Sturgeon’s unrealistic idea of Scottish independence.But this week, as Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land Of Hope And Glory hurtled towards the top of the iTunes chart, the fight back began.SINCERE condolences to Sir Ed Davey on winning the Liberal Democrat leadership yesterday.My thoughts are with you at this dficult time.SARAH Harding is the fighter of the entertainment industry.Vulnerable to a fault, during her time in Girls Aloud she shared her many trials and tribulations with that trademark throaty laugh and a glint in her eye.Unlike so many pop stars, there was never a hint of ego. In fact, Sarah is her own harshest critic.To discover that over the past few months she has privately been fighting the biggest battle of her le – breast cancer that has spread across her body – was truly a punch- in-the-guts moment for my generation, who idolised Sarah, Cheryl, Nadine, Kimberley and Nicola.I pray that she overcomes the odds, as she always has in her ied and accomplished career.And then reunites with Girls Aloud, as planned, for the band’s th anniversary in .THE great irony about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s newly revealed courtship with Jeremy Corbyn is that he’d love to see the monarchy abolished and Harry’s gran see out her days living in a council house.But so craven are Harry and Meghan for left-wing approval, they appeared to relish the post-Megxit support from the former Labour leader.New book Left Out: The Inside Story Of Labour Under Corbyn reveals that at the Commonwealth Day Service in March, where Prince William infamously snubbed the couple, Corbyn’s we Laura Alez, gave them a book about the th Century Mexican poet Juana Ines de la Cruz, “a nun whose willingness to attack the hypocrisies of the colonial classes had made her a target for establishment hate”. Harry and Meghan later sent a personal note of “great thanks” to Jeremy and Laura, writing: “Cruz is a fascinating historical figure, and we look forward to learning more about her le and works. Thanks for the support.”That revelation came one day after Meghan made her first intervention into this year’s US election, with a not-at-all-subtle anti-Trump message to American voters, suggesting: “We all know what’s at stake this year”.I have long been told by those close to her that Meghan harbours political ambitions and would one day like to end up in elected office.Which is absolutely fine.But to continue to use the Duchess title and represent the Queen on the Commonwealth Trust is highly inappropriate.I’d have great respectshe would cut the cords entirely and become a political activistwithout causing a massive diplomatic headache for the Royal Family.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With the ironic exception of the young adults that were in your group and one or two others, you all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates.

Then, for your partys grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet.

They also corrected Jo on her accusations that she was barred.

They then saw the tooth imprints matched their samples.He told The Times: If you look at the upper carnassial teeth there are three projections from the tooth and the distance between two of them is far wider in cats, probably double that found in a similar imprint from a dog.In the past six years we have analysed more than  skeletal remains and from that we have  good carnassial samples. Five of those we are relatively confident come from a medium to large-sized felid. The others are more suggestive of small carnivores but five certainly do fit the bill as far as puma or melanistic black leopard.Dr Hemmings said that five of his colleagues at the university had reported seeing a big cat, with one having seen a mountain lion, also known as a puma, vaulting a dry stone wall.Big cats are believed to have been released into the wild during the Second World War when meat for their food was scarce.Earlier this month, a big cat was spotted stalking through a park in Cambridge.Dan Underwood, who was there at the time, said: I was out and about enjoying the sun and spotted a very large cat walking across Coldhams Common.It was around pm and I was sat on Coldhams Common where the Parkrun would normally take place. I just saw it in the corner of my eye and just straight away took a video.It was the size of a medium dog, lean and very agile looking. It was a light sand colour with dark spots, and big pointed ears.Much bigger than a regular cat.It had no collar and didnt seem to be in any panic. It just simply walked on by.The markings on the cat, which Dan filmed, were distinctive and look similar to those of a Savannah Cat.In May, concerns were raised after a large cat went missing from a billionaire owner in Hampstead, North London.Armed cops were called to the scene after the hybrid Savannah cat was spotted in a garden.Officers were joined by an animal expert as they surrounded the feline but were unable to catch it.The politan Police said the cat was not deemed to be a danger to the public and no attacks had been reported.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The pair were so close that Meghan, , asked Jessicaaposs children to be part of her bridal party. However they reportedly fell out after Jessica was accused of abusing her white privilege by influencer Sasha Exeter. Sasha said Jessica had taken offence to her call for bloggers and social media stars to speak out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The former athlete, who runs the SoSasha website, also claimed Jessica had sent her a message which seemingly threatened to destroy her career. Sasha, who has more than , Instagram followers, said it was an example of textbook white privilege.  After she went public with the message, Jessica issued an apology, which she posted on Sashaaposs Instagram page. But the influencer later claimed that Jessica had issued another threat to her in a private message, in which Jessica threatened to take her to court over the row. The -year-old Canadian stylist posted an apology on her own Instagram page, admitting Sasha rightfully called me out for not doing enough when it came to engaging in the important and dficult conversation around race. The controversy resulted in Jessica losing her job on ABCaposs Good Morning America and a string of fashion deals.  Meghan is claimed to have be mortied and heartbroken and has since kept her distance. Earlier this month Jessica broke her silence to say she was in the worst state on Instagram a she celebrated her twin boys, Brian and John, turning . She shared a video of her husband Ben carrying their birthday cake into their Toronto garden before adding an emotional message about how she has been affected by the backlash from her comments during a spat with black influencer Sasha Exeter.

The likes of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson do. Or rather they exploit that myth for their own ends. Farage to whip up a rabid, right-wing following that has made him rich and famous, and Johnson to target a similar audience to win the Tory leadership.

New advice, published late on the Friday before schoolsnext week, outline a number of contingency plans for a worst-case scenario. They include a rota system limiting the number of pupils going to secondary schools at any one time in local lockdown zones. Teachers and students may need to wear face coverings in communal areas, the guidance confirms. Labour has slammed the timing of the announcement late on Friday before a bank holiday weekend, saying it beggars belief. The new guidance comes as Boris Johnson reiterated his view that getting kids back is Britainaposs most important task and he insisted pubs would shut before schools in the event of any future spike in infections.The staggered rota approach of two weeks in and two weeks out of school will reduce how many people students come into contact with, helping to break transmission chains by giving enough time at home for symptoms to become apparent, said the Department for Education .If a coronavirus case is confirmed, every pupil in the affected personaposs class, or bubble, may have to quarantine for two weeks, it added.A bubble could be a small number of children or it could be as large as the entire year group. Those affected would need to switch to distance learning and stay home for  days. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said any changes to school attendance will only ever be an absolute last resort.  He added: However, it is important that both Government and schools prepare for a worst case scenario, so this framework represents the sensible contingency planning any responsible government would put in place. But school leaders criticised the timing of the announcement, which came on Friday evening just before the bank holiday weekend, with millions of pupils ing to class next week for autumn term. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: To wait until the Friday night before most schoolsisnapost the Governmentaposs finest moment. Obviously, schools havenapost had any chance whatsoever to incorporate this into their planning and will now have to revisit the plans they have put in place. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, added: Weaposve been calling for the Government to publish a Plan B for several weeks.  Finally it is here, but another late night publication is fairly typical of what weaposve become used to. Meanwhile, Labouraposs shadow education secretary Kate Green said the timing of the guidance beggars belief. She added: The Governmentaposs incompetence is insulting to the school leaders and teachers who have worked so hard over summer to prepare schools for children to . The y guidance said schools should base their plans on a four-tier system, and the extra measures for secondary schools should kick in at the second tier. It said: Schools should ideally operate a rota system that means pupils spend two weeks on-site followed by two weeks at home.  However, schools can choose to operate a one-week rota this is necessary for the effective delivery of the curriculum. The guidance added: In all areas of national government intervention, at schools where students in year seven and above are educated, face coverings should be worn by adults and pupils when moving around the premises, outside of classrooms, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing cannot easily be maintained. The DfE said any suspected coronavirus cases will need to self-isolate and get tested.  It added: If a case is confirmed, local public health officials will work with the school to take appropriate measures, including asking all members of a pupilaposs bubble to isolate for  days and access remote education while other pupils continue attending. The guidance does not apply to primary school children, as scientic evidence indicates they play a limited role in transmission, it added. All schools remain open at tier one, while tiers three and four mean more stringent restrictions such as closures to all but pupils in vulnerable groups or children of key workers.

Wintry conditions will spread across Britain as temperatures plummet with frost expected to grip parts of the nation within just  hours.The latest BBC weather forecast shows the mercury will drop to just C by Sunday morning as the cold dampens holidaymakersapos hopes of a Bank Holiday staycation. Speaking exclusively to The , the Met Office confirmed the unusual weather conditions could lead to one of the coldest late Bank Holiday Mondays on record in certain parts of the UK.A spokesperson said: We could potentially see one of the coldest late Bank Holiday Mondays on record in certain parts of the UK. Whether we reach record cold temperatures or not, it is still a big dference compared to last year when we had the hottest late August Bank Holiday on record at .C. At midday today an area of North Yorkshire looks the coldest for England at the moment at .C. BBC meteorologist Phil Avery added this weekend could see a new record for the coldest Bank Holiday in August.He pointed out west is certainly best with the best prospects of a decent day on Sunday for those wanting to get out and about. The chilly Bank Holiday should see an overall C drop from the scorching temperatures recorded this time last year when the mercury reached C. Mr Avery said: It is mainly dry this weekend. As the day gets going, the western side of the UK should even see some decent sunny spells. But that weather front that has brought in so much disruption and rain is taking its time to pull away this morning. There are showers, and wind coming in from the North Sea. The Met Office said the combination of cold yet dry weather was unusual but not unheard of during the UK summer. A spokesperson said: Even though it is on the cold side, there is a lot of dry weather around throughout the long weekend. It is unusual but it is not unheard of. Strong gusts of wind are expected on the eastern side of the country reaching up to  miles per hour while Scotland faces frost.  The best Brits can expect for the long weekend are temperatures between C to C, according to the meteorologist. Mr Avery said: The strengths of the gust on the eastern side of the country are strong. The wind will reach up to  miles per hour along those exposed eastern coast so be carefulyouaposre out and about.  That wind and cloud gradually drts itself down into East Anglia and London. And because the wind is essentially from the north, it is not going to be warm. The best temperatures I could find today are between C to C. Scotland faces frost tomorrow morning as temperatures fall to C overnight, C in northern England and just C in London.  Mr Avery added:At least that cold equates to a decent day on Sunday, for the most part,you want to get out and about, though on the cool side.

Some cheeky punters have been gaming the August dining discount introduced to boost struggling cafes, pubs and restaurants after finding a catch. According to The , diners have been attempting to order their meals in parts - enabling them to split the bill per head throughout their stay - then applying the discount with every fresh transaction. The half-price discount has allowed savings of up to the value of £ off food and non-alcoholic drinks at participating establishments from Mondays through Wednesdays. Do you know of any Eat Out to Help Out scheme loopholes  Email webnews@mirror But dinersapos sneaky tactic could mean savings of up to £a table of six split a three course meal into staggered parts. According to the newspaper, several restaurants reported being asked to process bills for each course separately by customers - but most refused to do so. A Treasury source told thethere was nothing in the rules of the scheme to stop such behaviour. But a spokesperson for the Treasury called on the public to respect the spirit of the scheme, according to the newspaper. UK Hospitality added that it was aware of diners using the tactic.  Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, called the scheme a great success for coronavirus lockdown-hit hospitality businesses. But she said diners should checkthe business minds them gaming the billing before they try it. She told the newspaper: “Asking to be billed separately for inidual courses is not against the system. Businesses can claim back the money anyway, so, in theory, everybody benefitsthe discount is applied that way.  “It might cause administrative headaches for some businesses, though. So, it is a good ideacustomers talk to the business, ideally when they make their booking, to explain that’s how they want to be billed.” The loophole has reportedly annoyed some in the hospitality business.  But appear to have been encouraging tactical dining during Eat Out to Help Out month. Oisin Rogers, landlord of Guinea Grill and the Windmill in Mayfair, told thesome customers were buying their courses at separate establishments throughout the day to maximise their discount savings.

The increase in the number of new cases on the islands dropped signicantly to reach its lowest rise for more than a week as the country itself battles a second wave and has the highest infection rate across the EU EEA and UK area. Balearic Islands’ health chiefs announced  new Covid- cases late on Friday, down from  on Thursday and  on Wednesday. The rise in the number of new coronavirus positives was the lowest since the previous Thursday, when officials confirmed they had registered  new cases. However, Spain as a whole is still recording thousands of new cases of coronavirus every day, some regions on the mainland are still struggling to control outbreaks and other countries continue to impose new travel restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email your story to webnews@mirror. Spainaposs -day incidence rate of coronavirus is . cases per , people - the highest across the EU EEA and UK area - according to the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It was removed from the apossafe tavelapos list last month as cases soared in some regions, meaning anyone arriving in the UK from the mainland or islands must self-isolate for  days. The Foreign  Commonwealth Office currently advises against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands, based on the current assessment of Covid- risks. The news was announced as police in Brit-popular islands started to hand out the first fines to people flouting stricter smoking restrictions, night-time beach bans, and prohibitions limiting the number of people who can socialise together to  at any one time.  Minimum fines for flouting a ban on smoking anywhere in public have been set at € . Authorities have warned people those who breach the social gathering numbers limit could be hit with fines of up to €, . Balearic Islands government spokesman Pilar Costa has said tougher measures may be introduced as the region seeks to combat its second wave of Covid- cases and rescue what is left of the tourist season. She warned on Saturday: “If the figures are not positive, we will have to toughen the measures. “Onlythe new restrictions have the desired effect can they be loosened.” The drop in the number of new Covid- cases will offer a glimmer of hope for Brits seeking autumn sunshine getaways. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested last week islands like Ibiza or Majorca could be added to safe travel lists in future. The Balearic Islands government campaigned to get the region excluded from the UK government’s new Spanish quarantine rule when it was introduced last month. At the time the inclusion of the islands sparked uproar among tourists as the rates of infection were far below that of mainland Spain. A spike in the number of new cases later led to health chiefs in the Balearics admitting the islands were facing a second wave. One problem Brit holidaymakers could faceair bridges do become a reality is finding accommodation. Most of Majorca’s small and medium hotel chains are planning to close next week. In the Majorcan capital Palma  per cent of hotels are due to close until March. Javier Vich, president of the Hotel Association of Playa de Palma and Cala Mayor, told local press: “At the moment  of the  urban hotels are open, which is  per cent of the total.  “The outlook for November is very grim, with around  per cent of urban hotels due to close when in a normal year the figure would be  per cent.” Spain on Friday said it had diagnosed , new coronavirus cases in the previous  hours, down from a revised count of more than , on Thursday. It had previously said a record , new cases were detected. A cumulative total of , infections have been detected since the onset of the pandemic.

The Duchess of Sussex, , cuddled her aides and was visibly emotional as she spent her final hours in the UK following her and Prince Harryaposs bombshell decision to step down as senior members of the Royal Family. The former Suits actress then jumped on the last commercial flight of the day to make it home before son Archie woke up the next morning. Omid Scobie, was one of a number of journalists invited to Meghanaposs final engagement - a private meeting with Association of Commonwealth Universities scholars - during which she spoke to students about their work on subjects including climate change. Mr Scobie later wrote in the book he co-authored with Carolyn Durand, Finding Freedom, about how Meghan used that meeting to bid a final farewell to her team at Buckingham Palace. And he revealed Meghan hugged him before saying the tear-jerking seven words: It didnapost have to been this way. Mr Scobie wrote: “Staff who had been with the couple from day one were mourning the end of what was supposed to be a happy story: two people fall in love, get married, have a baby, serve the Queen, the end. Instead, they were leaving the country. “As Meghan gave me a final hug goodbye, she said, ‘It didn’t have to be this way’.” The Duchess was said to be sad that things hadnapost gone dferently as she and Harry prepared to start a new le together in Canada, and later in the USA.  Mr Scobie writing for Harperaposs Bazaar, added that tears that the duchess had been bravely holding back [were] free to flow among familiar faces.He added: The Duchess of Sussex emotionally [bid] much-loved aides farewell, with her flight aposhomeapos to Canada leaving in a matter of hours. Meghan would fly back to Canada on the last commercial flight of the day, eager to be back in Vancouver Island by the morning before Archie wakes up. Meghan is also said to have tearfully told a pal I gave up my entire le for this family after she was blamed for her and Harryaposs decision to step back.  She reportedly she was willing to do whatever it takes. In their statement earlier this year, Harry and Meghan said they wanted to carve out a progressive new role within this institution after many months of reflection and internal discussions. The couple made their last public engagement together as royals on Monday, March . They attended the Commonwealth Day ceremony at Westminster Abbey with the Queen and a host of other top royals. Meanwhile, this week Meghan gushed about Harry being a proud feminist and a aposbeautulapos role model for their son Archie in a new interview about the importance of voting.She spoke excitedly about her husbandaposs influence to US rights activist Gloria Steinem as they discussed female representation in politics. I look at our son and what a beautul example that he gets to grow up with a father who is so comfortable owning that as part of his own self-identication, said Meghan. Harry and brother Prince William also revealed on Friday how they are commissioning a statue of their mother Princess Diana on what would have been her th birthday. It will sit in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace, where Diana lived before she died. A new joint statement released on Friday said the brothers hope that the statue will help those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on their motheraposs le and legacy. The statue was first announced in  to mark the th anniversary of her death, but while the creation progressed the installation was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.The date has now been set as July , .

The woman called Jo left the review after visiting The Cowshed at Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, for her sister-in-lawaposs th birthday. She claimed that her party spent approximately £ between them on drinks and pizza before they were asked to leave by staff with awful attitude for being too drunk. In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].She then added: And, yes, our family member was sick, and yes, we cleaned it up so no members of staff were affected by this. Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldn’t go amiss – rude staff, huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out. But the restaurant, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor, shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out! We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.  Firstly, it said that Jo hadnapost spent the amount of money she claimed she did. To spend that amount of money they would have had to have ordered  of their most expensive pizzas and  of their most expensive drinks... The Cowshed continued: You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close. What you and your party spent, Jo, was a far more realistic and believable £ . Then it got a little brutal.  It added: You all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. At :pm you showed up with the tables you wanted already taken, but not to worry, we shuffled other customers about at your request in order to accommodate you.  Then you proceeded to pull our light fittings loose off our boundary fence in order to hang your birthday decor. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables and benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other. The group also supposedly treated The Cowshedaposs staff  like personal servants. It wrote: Clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at [staff], to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more. But it didnapost stop there. He also claimed the group refused to abide by social distancing rules following the coronavirus pandemic. Then, for your partyaposs grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to aposdeal with the situationapos and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffaposs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help. Donapost worry, the staff member that you nearly had in tears earlier on cleaned it up for you. "},{"url":null,"title":"schools coronavirus covid opening rules","story":"AdvertorialAll the things which are changing as schools and colleges open doors againEducational institutions are ready to welcome pupils back safely – and the benefits to their wellbeing and mental health are hugeShareByDave Masters:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialIt’s the start of a new term and it’s time for children across the country to get back to school, nursery and college. Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

The factory in Trent Vale, Stoke-on-Trent continues to operate despite the positive test results for the workers, who are still receiving full pay, according to owner Premier Foods. As it attempted to reassure customers and local residents, the firm said it is believed the staff members, who represent . per cent of the siteaposs workforce, caught the virus in the community. A number of colleagues who had close contacted with the infected workers, through car sharing, for example, are now self-isolating at home as a precaution, StokeonTrentLive reported. The factory makes millions of Mr Kipling cakes and pies each year. Have you been affected by the cases  Email webnews@mirror.  Stoke-on-Trent Council had said a cluster of Covid- cases had emerged and been linked to a food manufacturer in the Potteries. It did not name the site. A spokeswoman for Premier Foods confirmed they were six employees from the factory in Trent Vale. Four live in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, and two in Stoke-on-Trent. The council had said three of the workers were socially linked. The factory has brought in new measures including additional cleaning, head visors for staff and social distancing marshals. The Premier Foods spokeswoman said: The health and wellbeing of our colleagues is our absolute priority, and we have done everything we can throughout the pandemic to protect our teams. We have seen a very small number of colleagues test positive for Covid- at our Stoke factory, reflective of an increase in cases in the wider Stoke-on-Trent Newcastle-under-Lyme area. As a result, we have introduced further protective measures on site, in addition to our already stringent hygiene and safety procedures.  “We have been in contact with our local health protection team and are confident that we have taken all the necessary steps to protect our teams. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to keep local authorities updated. Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Abi Brown said it was satisfied with the measures taken by Premier Foods. She said: We have been working closely with all the food manufacturing businesses in the city, including Premier Foods, throughout the pandemic. Our public health team has been impressed with the measures introduced by Premier Foods, both before and since this issue. It is actually thanks to their processes that this issue came to light so quickly. We have been able to see that these infections did not take place in the factory itself, but in the community. In recent weeks, there have been clusters of cases at a number of businesses in the UK, including food factories. A Greggs depot in Bramley, near Leeds in West Yorkshire, was shut after about  staff were diagnosed. The distribution centre was due to be inspected and undergo a deep clean.  In the village of Attleborough in Norfolk,  workers at Banham Poultry processing factory have tested positive for the virus. About  families are now self-isolating. Meanwhile, a McDonaldaposs restaurant in Dagenham, east London, was shut after three staff members tested positive for Covid-. A company spokesperson said the restaurant was closed as a precaution. The spokesperson added: “As with all of the decisions we have made across this unprecedented period, the safety of our people and customers is our absolute priority, and we will re-open as soon as we feel we can,” the spokesperson said. McDonaldaposs has been using a number of safety measures in its restaurants, including perspex screens to prevent contact between workers and customers.

But staycationers will have to cope with cool temperatures, with more high winds and foggy spells forecast as temperatures take a nosee.The gloomy weather comes after Storm Francis wreaked havoc on the country earlier this week, with those heading away this weekend also warned to expect traffic chaos after millions hit the roads on Fridays, sparking huge delays on motorways.Latest BBC forecasts show temperatures as low as C in Edinburgh on Saturday night. The mercury will drop to C in Manchester on the same evening, while London is set to have a low of C. This comes just days after the UK experienced a y spell of scorching hot weather, with highs of C in the South East. Slightly warmer and sunnier weather should arrive from Sunday but temperatures should still struggle to exceed the late teens. Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office Frank Saunders said: “We’ve seen a real mix of weather this August - with a heatwave earlier this month and in the last week we’ve had two named storms bringing very wet and windy weather across the country.“With high pressure on the way this weekend we’re going to end the month with much more settled weather, with plenty of late summer sunshine for many. It’ll be a dry weekend for most areas too, though eastern areas can expect a few heavy showers on Saturday.”Mr Saunders continued: “It’ll feel quite cool despite the sunshine, as northerly winds bring below average temperatures for the time of year with highs of around  to  Celsius. At night it’ll feel really quite chilly, with temperatures dropping to single figures for most, and a chance of air frost in Scottish glens. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Chris Tubbs, said: “Later on Monday low-pressure will once again start to edge it’s way in from the Atlantic and it’ll turn cloudier with outbreaks of rain for Northern Ireland, with cloud and rain spreading to the rest of the UK by Tuesday.

Ye Ming Yuen, , was found in possession of drugs in a park in , and later pleaded guilty to drug trafficking after he admitted he shared them with friends. He was then caught using drugs again while on bail and was sentenced to  years in prison, along with the maximum number of strokes a male inmate can receive in Singapore. Describing the excruciating pain, Mr Yuen said the lashes were from a ft bamboo cane onto his naked buttocks while being secured to a large wooden trestle at Changi Prison on Wednesday. His injuries were so bad he was left with bowel problems and a paralegal almost fainted after seeing his injuries. The UK has since condemned Singapore over the flogging. Ravi Madasamy is considering taking legal action on behalf of Mr Yuen under the international human rights law. Human rights campaigners described the caning as inhuman, degrading and indecent.After ing to the prisonaposs visiting room, Mr Madasamy told the Mail Online : All over his buttocks were multiple marks and deep lacerations. It was so shocking my female paralegal who was with me almost fainted. The wounds were so deep with blood, flesh and layers of the skin exposed. He didn’t have any bandages, just a towel to put over the buttocks. He couldn’t sit for too long so he was standing up. It was the first time I had seen raw injuries like this and it left me deeply affected, thinking, “How can this be allowed to happen in a civilised country  Mr Yuen was flogged just one week after his appeal for clemency failed.  He could hear the screams and cries from fellow inmates being caned as he awaited his turn, before he was then strapped to the trestle, and a series of caners would take turns delivering the punishment to his naked buttocks with a cane soaked in water. The punishments was so severe, the caners had to swap after every six strokes to rest. Mr Yuen said he and the other inmates who suffered the flogging were sat on a bench with blood oozing, before a doctor gave them painkillers and anitbiotics. The pain left him unable to control his bowels and impossible to sit, with human lawyers warning that just six lashes are enough to cause le-long spinal and kidney injuries. Yuen moved to Singapore when he was  to live with relatives after his father was made bankrupt and could not afford his school fees at the £,-a-year Westminster School in London. According to reports, police officers found Yuen with g and g of cannabis, while another involved g of crystal meth when he was arrested in . Those caught in possession of more than g face the death penalty by hanging. In the UK, his offences at most would have seen him sentenced to prison for  months.

Franceaposs horsing world has been gripped by fear amid dozens of apossurgicalapos attacks where horses have been slashed, traumatised and often killed in pastures across France. Police have been left baffled as some  attacks have been reported from the mountainous Jura region in the east to the Atlantic coast, with many taking place this summer. Most often an ear – usually the right one – has been cut off. Fears have been raised as to whether the attacks are the morbid actions of an unknown cult, a chilling social media challenge or copycat acts. Agriculture minister Julien Denormandie said: We are excluding nothing. He added: Ears are cut off, eyes removed, an animal is emptied of its blood. All means are in motion to end this terror. Mr Denormandie revealed the horric news on Friday before heading to a riding club in the Saone-et-Loire region in east central France, where a horse was attacked a day earlier. The incidents date back at least six months, according to the news magazine Le Point. Officers in Auxerre, Burgundy, released a composite sketch this week based on a description from a man who confronted two attackers at his animal refuge in a village in Bourgogne-Franche-Comte. Nicolas Demajean, who runs the Ranch of Hope refuge, told France : I used to have confidence putting my horses out to pasture. Today, I have fear in my gut. Alerted by his squealing pigs, Mr Damajean faced down two attackers last Monday. He was injured in the arm in a struggle with one intruder who wielded a pruning kne, as the other slashed the sides of two traumatised ponies who are still recovering, he said.  The men fled in a vehicle and the following day, a pony was attacked in the Saone-et-Loire. In another case, some of a horseaposs organs were removed. A donkey said to participate in the Paris Christmas market was killed in a gruesome attack in June. Speculation is widespread as to how such barbaric acts, some surgical in nature, could be perpetrated without solid knowledge of equine anatomy or on a horse in a pasture which was presumably able to flee. Veterinarian Aude Giraudet, chief of the equine ision at the National Veterinary School of Alfort near Paris, said: A fearful horse in a pasture wonapost get caught.  The horse who feels confident with people – heaposll come, find it normal that you put a harness on it or a rope around its neck. Iaposm not sure you need great knowledge of horses. The veterinarian called for security measures such as cameras and said an ear can be slashed off while the horse is standing, but the animal would need to be prostrate for grislier mutilations. She added: If I were in Normandy, I think I would be very, very worried about this epidemic. Two mutilations have been reported in Normandy, Franceaposs horse country. Pauline Sarrazin launched Justice for our Horses after the savage killing of her horse Lady near Dieppe, on the Atlantic coast in June.

They cited a build up of pressure from methane gas in the thawing permafrost after a record hot summer in many Arctic regions across Russia. It is the th large cylindrical cavity to appear in the past six years, and previous craters have sparked conspiracy theories about everything from UFOs to Kremlin missile tests. Gas is released in soil that has been frozen for thousands of years but is now defrosting.The new hole was initially spotted by chance from the air by a Vesti Yamal TV crew en route from an unrelated assignment in July.A group of scientists then made an expedition to examine the large cylindrical crater estimated at up to ft deep. It is one of the biggest so far found.Scientist Dr Evgeny Chuvilin, a leading researcher at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, said it was “striking in its size and grandeur”. The crater came about from “colossal forces of nature”, he said. Professor Vasily Bogoyavlensky, of the Russian Oil and Gas Research Institute in Moscow, told the TV station: “This object is unique. “It holds a lot of additional scientic information, which I am not yet ready to disclose. “This is a subject for scientic publications.” These craters appear because “gas-saturated cavities are formed in the permafrost, he said. A void space is filled with gas with high pressure and the covering layer distends, the thickness of which is five to ten metres [-ft] approximately”, he added. Some but not all explosions have occurred in swelling pingos - or mounds - in the tundra when the gas builds up under a thick cap of ice.Bogoyavlensky has previously claimed that drilling for natural gas in Yamal - a key supplier for Europe - may be a factor in the eruptions. He is also concerned at the risk of ecological disastersthe explosions occur under gas pipelines, production facilities or residential areas. He said previously: “In a number of areas, pingos - as we see both from satellite data and with our own eyes during helicopter inspections - literally prop up gas pipes. “In some places they jack up the gas pipes... they seem to begin to slightly bend these pipes.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/KCes_Kilted_Kangaroo_Reopening_Dundee_02.07.20-3_35774759-scaled.jpg ","title":"kilted kangaroo in dundee welcomes permanent outdoor bar and marquee","story":"A popular Dundee bar has been granted planning permission for an outdoor bar and marquee on a permanent basis.Planning bosses at Dundee City Council have granted the Kilted Kangaroo on Roseangle permission for a bar, wooden toilet cabin and marquee to be set up in its beer garden for the next five years.The planning permission also allows the pub to widen the existing garden wall entrance by two metres and install a gate.Kilted Kangaroo’s outdoor marquee has already been up and has proven to be a hit with Dundee punters already. vw, px\"  A spokeswoman from the bar said: “We have always had the beer garden here but over the coronavirus lockdown we put up a canopy so people can sit outside.“It is now a fully ing beer garden which is keeping everyone quite happy.“The marquee started when the pubs first reopened and people are loving it.“It is definitely the most popular place in the town because we have the beer garden here.”She added they are still implementing strict social distancing rules and are making punters wear face masks when they walk around the pub, for examplethey go to the toilet.And the Kilted Kangaroo is looking at options to hire the marquee and outdoor beer garden area out to large parties in the future.The new beer garden will be open from am until .am each day , and Dundee City Council has told the bar there is to be no loud music in the outdoor space. vw, px\"  A council report on the plans stated: “The proposed development will be located at the bottom of the existing beer garden and will replace an existing dispense bottle bar.“The proposal is required as a result of the Covid- pandemic and would provide a covered outdoor area and to help maintain the viability of the business.“The new container bar, timber toilet block and temporary marquee structure would be located at the lowest point of the sloping rear garden ground, away from the listed building and trees and shrubs will provide screening from the south.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

What a waste of time.#How are ministers meant to knowtheir measures are having any impact at all or which countries pose a dangerthey don#t hold these numbers  It beggars belief.#I#m convinced that this Scottish Government has no clue about how to manage the easing of lockdown while protecting both people#s lives and livelihoods.#Public Health Scotland#s Covid- statistics report will include for the first time on August  data on the number of people arriving in Scotland from outside the UK, the number required to quarantine and those contacted by government tracers.Ms Freeman admitted early last month that no checks had yet been carried out on whether iniduals arriving in Scotland from abroad had been abiding by quarantine rules because of a delay in accessing Home Office systems.Public Health Scotland now receives the contact details of any passengers identied as requiring to self-isolate as part of an agreement with the Home Office.The body then selects a random sample of quarantined passengers to contact with public health advice and information.Official records show , successful contacts have been made since June , with a further  in progress, and , emails have been sent with additional public health guidance in relation to quarantine and self-isolation.Nicola Sturgeon was challenged on the issue at the Scottish Government#s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.The first minister said genomic sequencing work had provided insight into the number of importations of the virus into Scotland between February and March.#Some of this is not quite as straightforward as you might think,# Ms Sturgeon said.#We obviously look at cases very closely on a daily basis, so there will be intelligence being gathered on whether people who have cases have had recent travel history.#But you cannot then make an automatic assumption that somebody who was, for argument#s sake, in Spain a few weeks ago and is now in Scotland with the virus, brought it here from Spain. They may have picked it up here.##And that#s where the genomic sequencing work is an important part of robustly validating that kind of information.#We will always look at the information that can be reliably made available from the daily work that Public Health Scotland do looking at cases but the question of where someone got coronavirus sometimes needs more scientic explanation.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

for people project","story":"A Stonehaven cafe boss has argued that without the Spaces for People project, her venue would not have been able to reopen after lockdown.Megan Langdon, who manages Molly’s Cafe Bar at the town’s beach, was moved to speak-out after concerns were raised the social distancing measures are causing trouble for the seaside town’s economy.Last week, Aberdeenshire Council’s infrastructure committee was told by Stonehaven and Lower Deeside councillor Wendy Agnew the controversial changes to the town’s infrastructure have left certain businesses feeling “worried”.She said some have noted a “massive drop in turnover” which they believe is due to loss of parking spaces.But Ms Langdon says the changes # which include widened pavements and pedestrianisation # have been of huge benefit to her business.Without the Spaces for People initiative, she said she would not have been able to open up additional outdoor seating, leaving her with only six tables inside.Thanks to the project, she can now offer  tables.Ms Langdon says she believes dferent parts of the town are having dferent experiences # and cannot be treated as one.She said: “If we hadn’t had the space down the beach pedestrianised and space made for people to socially distance, I honestly don’t think we could have reopened the business.“With the changes made, people can feel safe and it’s a very family-friendly environment.“The situation at the beach has got lumped-in with the issues in the town centre, when it’s very much a separate entity from that.“I think some of the concerns are valid and I understand that a lot of the retail units are struggling.“I also understand that there’s a loss of parking and there’s dficulties in the town centre, but down here it is a positive.She added: “We feel the council have bent over backwards and are doing everything they can.“What seems to get lost is the council is trying to keep everyone safe. That needs to be done.”Ewan Wallace, head of transportation with Aberdeenshire Council, explained the region wanted to make it clear it was open for business, in the wake of a council meeting last week on Spaces for People proposals.He said: “We have sought to create space in town centres to try and give people some more confidence when visiting them.“The approach we have taken has been fully supported by Public Health colleagues who have been right behind us in terms of our response to the current emergency.We’ve kept all of the measures under review on a weekly basis, with regular monitoring by officers and potential changes considered each week.“Clearly the emergence from lockdown has taken longer than we expected but we have maintained our professional rigour and consistency to consider the changes we can put in place at dferent locations.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The hairpin, is in the shape of a butterfly which symbolises joy and is decorated with pearls and precious stones. vw, px\"  The Chinese ivory hair ornament, far right, is decorated with a carving of a girl carrying a lotus flower.

Only Francis Munro , Mark McGhee , Adam Rooneyand Sam Cosgrovehad previously achieved that feat.Capped three times by Wales, Hedges hopes national Ryan Giggs will be monitoring the action at Easter Road tomorrow.Alongside Hedges fellow Welsh call-up hopefuls Marley Watkins, on loan at Aberdeen from Bristol City, and Hibs striker Christian Doidge are set to feature.He said: “You hope they will come up. We just need to keep producing andwe are doing well then hopefully I can get back in the Welsh squad.”Only four games into the new campaign Hedges has already equalled his four goal tally from last season.He began last season strongly only to fall out of the starting-line up at the end of the year.Following the January winter break he made just one start before football was shut down in March due to the pandemic.He said: “I need consistency.“I am looking to keep my place in the team by performing well every week and by bringing goals and assists.“It is up to me to do that.”Hedges completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after midfielder Lewis Ferguson was brought down late on.Ferguson had converted a spot-kick in the - defeat of Livingston in the absence of regular penalty taker Sam Cosgrove due to a long term knee injury.Scotland U international Ferguson stepped aside to let Hedges secure his hat-trick.“I just wanted to take it for the opportunity to get my hat-trick.“I wouldn’t say he gladly stepped aside but Lewis did and fair play to him for doing that.“Butwe get one on Sunday I would think he would be on them again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Obviously they are glad to see the children getting back to some sort of normality in schooling, but they have trusted us with the arrangements to safeguard the children and I feel very lucky to have that support.#Faced with a constantly changing picture, both locally and nationally, Miss Devine commented: #It is challenging to respond to that and keep lines of communication open with parents. Argyll and Bute Council has been good at giving guidelines to schools and that has helped a lot.#The council has also supplied hand sanitiser, face masks, gloves and visors and, said Miss Devine, the school is prepared to deal with anyone displaying symptoms.#We have thermometers in the school and we would testwe had concerns about a child becoming ill. There are straightforward guidelines that when a child displays symptoms they should be isolated and taken home immediately.#She added: #As yet we haven#t haven#t had to put those measures into practice.#In the event of a pupil being unable to attend school, Miss Devine confirmed that the online teaching s have been retained #as a safety net#.Miss Devine concluded: #Everybody is having to get used to the new health and safety protocols, but thus far people feel well supported.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should notbe excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our approach remains commensurate with the evidence and the levels of transmission in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"face-masks-schools-buy-coverings-suitable-children","story":"From the beginning of

Cairngorms are quite dferent to many of other Scottish mountain ranges. Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance.

Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list.

Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should not be excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

Galloway is famous for its granite foundations, but this place has begun to move so quickly that nothing is certain anymore.I have always been fascinated by birds. More than any other species, curlews seemed to represent the rough, endless Galloway landscapes that I had known as a child. However, many of these places have simply vanished over the past  years. Come down into Galloway through Carsphairn nowadays and yoursquoll pass through  square miles of commercial forest plantation, electricity pylons and wind turbines. That used to be curlew country a place where the birds were so numerous that naturalists could hardly be bothered to count them. But curlews have declined by almost three quarters since , and it seems likely that they could soon be gone altogether.Curlews depend upon wide, moorland habitats which are created and maintained by old-fashioned agriculture. As I worked with traditional cattle over several years, I steadily sank into a way of le that is now facing extinction. Galloway cows produce excellent beef, but their carcases are small and slow-growing. Supermarkets prefer to work with faster breeds of cattle, and the financial case for farming in the hills gets slimmer every year. No matter how carefully I herded my cows and drove them out to the moors, money remained tight and fewer curlews ed to breed each year.As farming and forestry have intensied, curlews have been pressed out of existence - Itrsquos fair to reckon that they have now declined too far to recover here. Huge new forest creation targets mean that thousands of acres of their habitat continue to be be ploughed and planted every year a forester friend confessed that the industry now has a simple goal to plant up the places they missed in the s.Itrsquos not clear where this leaves Galloway. For all that I mourn the loss of curlews, their decline is simply part of a much bigger sht in culture, heritage and communities in the south west. I find meaning and value in the old farming ways, but I canrsquot deny that I am fretting over the remains of something that is already dead. Irsquom tortured by the realisation that we have lost so much, but as I sank deeper into keeping and breeding Galloway cattle, I was ever more tantalised by the realisation that powerful fragments of the old ways remain.There is something very human in the culture of this place which nothing can erase. Most people find Galloway strangely enigmatic. Wersquore just part of ldquoDumfries and Galloway, and itrsquos not always clear to outsiders where the line lies between these two component parts. Many people say it doesnrsquot matter, but try saying ldquoGalloway doesnrsquot exist to a pub full of folk in Castle Douglas or Newton Stewart. Itrsquos not always a pretty place or an easy existence le in these hills can be desperately isolated and lonely, but the hardships are often more formative and interesting than days when the moors tremble with smiles and sunshine.It turns out that my style of farming calls for a dficult balance between loss and preservation. The way things have gone in Galloway, we have not been able to choose what we are allowed to keep and what has been taken from us. My grandfather would have said that it was unimaginable to think of Galloway without curlews the birds seemed to serve as an icon for the place. But as curlews begin to slip out of sight, therersquos still hope in the discovery that some things can never be lost.Native: Le in a Vanishing Landscape by Patrick Laurie is published by Birlinnand is shortlisted for the Wainwright Prize for Nature Writing.

Oldman and Co. do the rest, though itrsquos up to the viewer to decideAlfredson is filming the book or making a lushcinema version of the iconic  television series which starred Alec Guinness as Smiley. There are certainly some cute nods in its direction. At one point we see Smiley go for an eye test and emerge from the opticians wearing a new pair of glasses, but out are the s-style ones he wears in the filmrsquos opening scenes and in are the exact pair Alec Guinness wears. At the same time there are other touches which seem entirely Alfredsonrsquos. After recruiting ex-Special Branch officer-turned-amateur beekeeper Mendel , Smiley and Guillam drive back to London with one of Mendelrsquos bees trapped in the car with them.

Across the UK, as headlines foretold the devastation lockdown would wreak on this seasonal trade ndash footage of acres of wilting plants was grim ndash cannier businesses immediately shted to online and telephone orders. And, as recent figures show, people responded enthusiastically. During that period, Britons spent around pound. billion on garden plants, materials and tools. Contrary to the stereotypical picture of a Mr McGregor retiree, footering around in his potting shed, it was millennials who spent most. Their investment was double that of the rest of us, with the - age group spending an average pound per person, compared with pound among others.Some of that might be explained by the urgent need for equipment to turn a rectangle of grass into a more imaginative space for all the family to enjoy. Irsquom long past their age but still so new to gardening that I recall those early months as a ceaseless outlay on shears, secateurs, spades, forks, trowels, rakes, sieves... I could go on. Hence the need for a shed, which was soon festooned with tools dangling from hooks, propped against walls and stacked on shelves. Think of an Italian deli, with hams and salamis overhead, and floor to ceiling storage. Replace the delicious aroma of cheeses, coffee beans and truffles with potting compost, muddied buckets and oil to keep blades moving, and you get the picture.There are professional horticulturalists where I live who are well under , but thatrsquos probably not surprising. Those who choose to live in the country are already keen on the outdoors, whatever their vintage. Yet there is something of a renaissance occurring in this generation, as interest in their own plot is sparked into le, whether itrsquos an allotment, balcony, or back yard.In response to what you might call a growing trend, Alan Titchmarsh has said that he hopes more young folk will be encouraged to pick up their trowels and dig up drives, to help protect the planet. ldquoItrsquos not just about going on marches, he says. ldquoBeing practical is a hugely underrated resource and skill.Those who have unexpectedly found themselves with time to devote to their patch have probably realised how enjoyable it is too. Being in the fresh air, surrounded by birds, and perhaps with children larking around, has shown how much pleasure can be had in maintaining your part of the world. At this stage of le, competition for peoplersquos spare time is usually ferocious, with the demands of socialising, keeping fit and raising a family. In the past, unless you were actively emulating the Good Le, choosing to spend the weekend planting drills of potatoes or deadheading roses was borderline eccentric.Being forced to spend so much time at home has clearly made people reassess their outdoor space, and consider its potential. Making their plot child-friendly has been a priority for some. But for those who dread the thought of a football landing on tender seedlings and new blooms, there should be no conflict between serious cultivation and youngsters ndash quite the opposite. The earlier children encounter flowers and trees and the wildle they attract, the better for all our futures. And the sooner they recognise the need to treat living things with respect ndash although some trampling and breakage is almost inevitable ndash the more they will understand not just how nature works, but the ways in which we can support it.Irsquove lost count of the number of people who have said how much they have relished this aspect of lockdown. Having nowhere  to go has allowed them to concentrate on matters horticultural, and take time to make decisions or try experiments they otherwise could not have attempted. Having many more unfilled free hours has its upsides, as one neighbour has discovered. When the pandemic took hold she turned her greenhouse into a hotbed of tomatoes and her flowerbeds into a lettuce patchwork, and has been feasting on salads all summer. As have her friends.Inevitably, once the world opens up again, some recent converts will lose interest and the weeds will take revenge. Yet I have no doubt that many will already be hooked. The secret that no gardener ever mentions is that it is addictive. Each tiny success gives confidence to try something more adventurous. Mistakes are inevitable, but so are accidental triumphs. The thrill of discovering strawberries or nasturtiums thriving where before was a bed of nettles, is inspiring. The sight of bees and birds hovering for nectar, seeds and grubs is like preparing a banquet and watching as guests pile their plates high. To be honest, environmental reasons for sustainable, eco-friendly gardening are all but forgotten in the joy it brings. The reason why benches in most well-tended grounds go largely unused is because therersquos always something clamouring for attention. To sit sipping a GT while an unpruned shrub stares at you reproachfully, or a juicy stick of rhubarb cries out to be picked, is almost impossible.In my own limited experience, trying to keep on top of it all ndash and never coming remotely close ndash is part of what it is about. An expert recently told me that a garden will take all the time you give it, and then some. Yet the depths of winter is the time to put your feet up .

Unwelcome grubs could tunnel inside the fruit or jays pierce the skin, letting flies and wasps tuck in.The only solution is to grit your teeth and try to improve things for next year. Undoubtedly the commonest and most frustrating problem is beyond your control: fruit splitting.The day before writing, I was up the ladder, picking off split greengages at the top of the tree trained against the house.The warm dry spell had hardened and dried the skins and then came the rains. This caused the splitting.The tree pumped up large quantities of water to the fruits, which effectively burst as a result. Rotting began and flies moved in.My gage is in an impossibly dry, south-facing bed, but you can often control moisture levels while fruits swell.After winter, mulch the damp soil round the tree to conserve and provide a steady supply of water. This also eliminates weed competition.Like us, many creatures want the fruit, not least the plum mothrsquos caterpillars.

You can compost themtheyrsquore covered with a good layer of hot, fresh grass clippings, or use a hotbin. Otherwise bin the waste.Try to ensure the vegetation round a tree is as low as possible, either by mowing or strimming and clearing.Any fungal spores on the ground will be exposed to winter frosts. As we all know, plums can be overly generous, cropping more heavily than a branch or stem can handle.The ideal solution is to prevent the problem by thinning fruit but this is, of course, completely unrealistic for large trees.Evenyoursquod been keeping a close eye on a tree and noticed vulnerable branches, they may have been inaccessible, so yoursquoll have to remove a broken branch, cutting back cleanly and as close to the trunk or branch as possible.You should always quickly remove any damaged or diseased branches, but you should also carry out any major pruning after fruiting, not over the winter.Like cherries, apricots and peaches, plums are prone to silver leaf disease, a fungal disorder that finally kills the tree.

The negotiating and working staff teams are deep on talent, many being career civil servants and non-partisan trade diplomats. There are  US and UK support staff from ious agencies with nearly  negotiating groups. In the third round alone, there were  sessions and  dferent workstreams. The fourth round is expected to convene in early September. Even with this accelerated pace, reaching the finish line and breaking the tape for an agreement by the end of the year is, in the words of Ambassador Lighthizer, ldquonearly impossible. The UK also is stretched on other negotiating fronts including the higher priority of the EU. Evena deal is reached, the US Congress will need to approve it, and the days in session before the end of year during a hotly contested election are limited.The distinctive voice of Scotland in these negotiations is vital. Dr Liz Cameron, CEO of Scottish Chambers that forms  Chambers of Commerce across Scotlandrsquos towns, regions and cities, is an effective promoter for Scottish business for the negotiations because she sits on the UK Strategic Trade Advisory Group. Truss has also been proactive in assembling  trade advisory groups across the UK to, in her words, ldquokeep businesses closer to the negotiating table.Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power, sits on one of the advisory groups. However, that Scottish voice needs to not only be internal to the UK. It is critical for the United States and other countries to understand the unique values and economic sectors that comprise the Scottish economy and society, and, for that matter Wales, Northern Ireland, and England. To look at the UK through too wide an aperture will prevent businesses, investors, and government policy-makers from gaining a deeper understanding of how to strategically engage and successfully partner with business and entities across sectors and regions.Scotland is a trading nation, confidently operating on the global stage. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Trade Minister Ivan McKee have consistently emphasised this point, and the Scottish Government is investing in building export capacity through the ldquoExport Challenge. The number one international export country for Scotland is the United States. The latest trade data shows this figure was approximately pound. billion per year. Further, US and international businesses are increasingly attracted to Scotland for engagement and direct investment. Scottish Chambers of Commerce have as many as  trade missions to US cities each year.When the US government understands how deep and valued the trading and cultural relationship is they will not move to impose  percent tarfs as they did on a range of Scottish products, including single malt whisky, cashmere, sweet biscuits, cheese, and wool items. Those tarfs are neither good economic policy nor constructive diplomatic practice for allies. As Minister McKee has said, ldquoScottish businesses are being hit hard by these tarfs and jobs and livelihoods are now at risk. These tarfs have also negatively impacted on American consumers and importers. They should have never happened. With advocacy from Truss and Scottish government and industry leaders, the US has committed to lt some of the tarfs, but, unfortunately, some still remain.The US and UK trade negotiations offer a backdrop and an opportunity for Scottish enterprise to be heard. This is happening, but it needs to go much deeper. US decision-makers and Members of Congress would be wise to encourage this direct channel of dialogue, and Scottish industry and enterprise networks prudent to proactively nurture it. Eventhere is no trade agreement by the end of the year, the results of substantive briefings by Scottish enterprise leaders will reinforce an historically close relationship, spark a realisation of the many growth sectors that exist and can be forged, and heighten recognition of what makes Scotland a unique market. That approach would be beneficial to us all now and going forward.Ian Houston has spent a long career in Washington, DC, as an international non-profit leader, and a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation.

Phil hasnrsquot changed a bit, apart from the receding forehead.The essential building blocks of the show have stayed the same, too. ldquoWe headed to a quiet bar to think things through, said Phil in that first show. Cue the call to estate agents to put in a cheeky offer well under the asking price. Then the tense wait.Before getting to that point there were tours round houses, Kirstie being up front and pushy, Phil adopting a more softly-softly approach. Kirstie hated it when Phil said, as he did often, ldquoItrsquos up to them. Kirstie wanted to give buyers the stats on the best time to start a family so they would stop dithering about the number of bedrooms needed.We did not learn much that was new as Ben and Laura, Jess and Sam, and Michelle and Philip, followed the original Kate into the snakes and ladders game that is buying a house.

Too cosy talking shop within his own tribe - never get him started on trade union history - he hasnrsquot reached out widely enough to voters, hasnrsquot fought hard enough for their attention.Whatever the message, it needs the right messenger to be heard.As one party source told me more in sorrow than anger: ldquoHersquos making no impact whatsoever.

But the Scottish Government is currently not just in danger of being excessively secretive, but of making itself absurd through its refusal to provide the public with answers to basic questions.The question of when the First Minister first knew that people positive with coronavirus were being discharged into care homes is a matter of urgent public interest. It is not one that compromises the privacy of inidual patients or impinges on the Governmentrsquos ability to make the best decisions. Nor should it be one that requires her to obtain details from Public Health Scotland it is inconceivable that she does not know the answer. She is simply refusing to give it.The assumption must be that it is one that doesnrsquot show her and the Government in the best light. But the refusal to answer is worse than simply admitting as much. Scots are well aware that government is not infallible, and this Government in particular has been afforded a generous degree of latitude for its mistakes. In part, that may be due to the reasonable and realistic recognition of this fact that it presents in its rhetoric.That counts for nothing, however, when its responses ndash or refusals to respond ndash fail to correspond with those public statements. There has been an alarming pattern of behaviour on this front. To take just a few instances, there has been the Queen Elizabeth Hospital inquiry, the reluctance to publish minutes of ministerial meetings, delays to routine Freedom of Information requests, an attempt to sneak out an ICEA report critical of education policy, Audit Scotlandrsquos damning assessment of secrecy surrounding PFI projects, the disgraceful evasion over the role of government and public officials in the inquiry into Alex Salmond ndash after assurances that all such material would be forthcoming ndash and now the ludicrous claim that an effective reaction to the Covid emergency would be constrained by the answer to a simple question about when the Government knew what.All of these obfuscations give little reason for public confidence that an inquiry into coronavirus policy, when it finally comes, will uncover the full picture. The Government gives lip service to statements about how mistakes will undoubtedly have been made it makes glib pronouncements about how important it will be to identy them, and ensure that lessons are learnt so that they are not repeated.But the reality is that it goes to enormous s ndash and often, when the courts are involved, enormous cost to the public purse ndash to avoid answering such questions, far less admit its own failings. That is an unhealthy attitude, corrosive of public confidence and damaging to good governance.Whatrsquos more, given that the electorate is composed of grown-ups and, on current showings, far from censorious, it is a politically foolish and counterproductive one. There are relatively few legitimate reasons, generally to do with security concerns or momentous economic decisions likely to move markets, for government business to be conducted privately. Potential embarrassment to the SNP is not one.The expectation should be that frank disclosure is the norm it benefits the Government by making them seem like fair dealers, it improves policy decisions for the future and, above all, it is a reminder that the public has a right to know, and that politicians should be the peoplersquos servants, rather than the reverse."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-football-fans-set-september-return-pilot-scheme-date-announced","story":"The Scottish Government rejected a proposal from Celtic that would have seen a limited number of supporters attend their fixture with Motherwell this weekend.But the Joint Response Group have now confirmed that three games could be used as test events on Saturday, September .Rod Petrie, Joint Response Group Chair said: ldquoThis is a welcome and positive development for Scottish football, as the national sport, to build on the sporting pilot taking place at BT Murrayfield this evening.ldquoWe have already written to clubs to obtain their Return to Supporting plans specic to each stadium and will now follow-up with those clubs able to participate in the initial pilot on  September.If successful, these trial fixtureswould be part of a phasedof fans to stadia in the weeks following.TheJRG will liaise with Premiership clubs to finalise arrangements in the coming days.Neil Doncaster, SPFL Chief Executive said: ldquoClubs have worked tirelessly to ensure football couldsafely at the start of this month and news that fans will be allowed in, albeit in restricted numbers, within a matter of weeks is hugely encouraging.ldquoWe look forward to liaising with government to build on the sporting pilot at BT Murrayfield and to provide the necessary support to clubs to facilitate the eagerly awaitedof fans who - now more than ever before ndash are the leblood of our game.\""},{"url":null,"title":"economic-storm-blame-game","story":"The Ross Clark remembers the Thursday nights when everyone gathered on their doorsteps to applaud the NHS workers risking their lives.ldquoThey were putting their own safety aside to work in close proximity with people who were desperately ill with the virus and were coughing it out in copious quantities, he said. ldquoCompared with the risks run by frontline nurses and doctors at the height of the epidemic in March and April the dangers faced by office workers now are miniscule.He asked why so many workers have not ed to the office, pointing out that, in London, just  per cent are back at work.ldquoYou have to wonder what has happened to the nationrsquos productivity given that millions of people used to an office environment suddenly work from home, away from the eyes of their bosses, he said. ldquoProductivity in many organisations has not exactly been impressive since staff started working from home.

Itrsquos an institution. Itrsquos a sad, sad thing that itrsquos had to close.ldquoIt used to be absolutely jumping. Everyone from the Gray Dunn Biscuit Factory would drink in here. There were six flats above the pub alone, as well as all the other tenements. It was always a family pub. My we would feed all the regulars, buy them clothesthey needed it. Shersquod bring in pots of soup, mince and potatoes. There was never any trouble.The day before the pub closed, John McGarvey from Pollok was having one last drink with his elderly father Howard and his uncle Noel.Noel and Howard both grew up in Ireland and would meet in the pub with other members of the Irish community.ldquoWe lived in Eaglesham Street in Kinning Park, John said. ldquoWe have lots of happy memories of spending time in the Stanley Bar as a family. There was a close Irish community and my mum would sing traditional Irish music in the pub band. Pubs on Paisley Road West always changed their names but the Stanley Bar was always the Stanley Bar. Irsquove brought my dad and uncle here today for one last drink.Danny Rodgers from Govan is another child of the area. ldquoI was born on Stanley Street. My family grew up here. We moved to Cessnock just as the motorway was being built. Even though now therersquos no houses or communities, people still came back to the Stanley Bar and their sons and daughters would come because their parents drank here. For Celtic games and special occasions they would all come back.Another regular, Brian Devaney, who lives in Cessnock, chooses to drink in the Stanley Bar shybecause itrsquos the only Celtic pub in the area. ldquoWhen Celtic win big games we go outside in the street and do the huddle. It stops traffic.ldquoIrsquove drank in here for  years. My father drank in here. Itrsquos sad.Such are the strong memories associated with the Stanley Bar, those who have moved from the area continue to visit. Neil Hargan, who grew up on Stanley Street before moving to Blackpool, goes to the pub each time hersquos back in Glasgow. ldquoMy father worked in Gray Dunn Biscuit Factory. I have memories of the area and I know the regulars ndash itrsquos still the same people who were drinking there  years ago. There was a good laugh and patter and characters. I would walk in and it would be asI still lived there. Recently I went in and there was a man I knew sleeping on the chair beside me. He woke up and said lsquoAlright, Neillsy,rsquo asIrsquod never been away.ldquoIt was a good wee pub and there was no trouble in it. I am devastated it is closing.The area of Kinning Park between the Glasgow ndash Paisley railway line and Paisley Road West was one of the cityrsquos neighbourhoods lost to the construction of the M. Its sandstone tenements were demolished and residents shipped to other parts of the city, separating neighbours, friends and long held community ties.The closure of the Gray Dunn Biscuit Factory in  was another blow to the area, resulting in almost  staff being made redundant. The imposing building, which dominated the city skyline view from the M, was demolished in , adding to the desolation of the area. The former Our Lady and St Margaretrsquos Primary School opposite the factory site was saved due to its listed status and has now been converted into offices, while the adjoining former presbytery remains derelict.Called ldquothe last post by regulars, the Stanley Bar was the only remaining evidence of a once vibrant community.But with rising costs, dwindling regulars and Covid- making the pub more dficult to sustain,the Byrne family made the shydficult decision to give it up.ldquoIn the last two years around  regulars who came in every day for their half and half have died, John said. ldquoWe had two domino teams ndash four of the members have died. The price of beer has gone up, as well as electricity. Sky television ndash theyrsquore bullies. Twelve hundred pounds a month for a wee pub like this. Butyou donrsquot have it you donrsquot get the clientele. The last two years wersquove been struggling, last year was the worst, then lockdown finished us. And lockdown is going to come back again, we know it is.ldquoWe hoped we could sell it to business people in the community but they know itrsquos not making enough money. And the guy next door came to my brother with a great offer. Itrsquos a shame but what can we do  We tried everything."},{"url":null,"title":"football-added-pilot-events-scottish-sport-welcomes-back-fans","story":"Provisional plans have been drawn up for three Scottish Premiership games to host fans in pilot events on September  ndash two days before the indicative date for spectators to be allowed toto sports stadiums in limited numbers.About  Edinburgh fans were granted access to Murrayfield for the Guinness PRO encounter, the first sports event to be played in front of a crowd in Scotland since lockdown in mid-March.### Keep up to date with the vital matchday information ahead of tonights derby at @BTMurrayfield.Stay safe and enjoy the game! #mdash Edinburgh RugbyAugust , The Scottish government had turned down Celticrsquos request to host a small crowd when Motherwell visit Parkhead on Sunday, stressing that the rugby test event could help provide lessons that would help football.But the football authoritiesrsquo Joint Response Group announced that sports minister Joe FitzPatrick had confirmed that up to three pilot events could take place in the Scottish Premiership on September .A statement added: ldquoIf successful, this would be part of a phasedof supporters to football stadia with incrementally increased numbers in the weeks following the initial pilot event date.ldquoThe JRG will be liaising with Premiership clubs and the Scottish government over the next week to finalise details.September  sees Rangers host Dundee United while Celtic travel to Dingwall to take on Ross County.Aberdeen host Kilmarnock, St Johnstone visit Motherwell, Livingston take on Hamilton in West Lothian and St Mirren face Hibernian in Paisley.

We are therefore calling for industry to review and contribute to the plan.” The recovery plan is available to view on the CLF website.Feedback can be submitted via the website on enquiries@constructionforum.scot by September .CLF will take all feedback on board to help develop the plan further, with regular updates published on the CLF site.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Clare Cushenan started Special Delivery NI last year.She brings gt baskets packed with items for mum and baby to hospitals for new mothers - along with positive and reassuring information about Down Syndrome.And now she is seeking help from retailers and the public to ensure the caring project goes from strength to strength.Clare explains: “I started Special Delivery NI because when my third child, Aoe, was bornI was given her Down Syndrome diagnosis shortly after her birth.“I was shocked and didn’t know what le with a child who was ‘dferent’ would be like. “How would this affect my family  Would she be able to go to school with her older brother and sister  How would we cope with this ”Clare says she was given lots of leaflets on Down Syndrome which seemed to concentrate on all the ious the health concerns people with DS might face. She added: “It appeared to have her le mapped out. It was overwhelming and unfortunately mainly negative, slanted towards the worst case scenario. The midwives though very kind didn’t alleviate any of my fears - but how could they  “They had no frame of reference, just a memory of the last woman who had a baby with Down syndrome and left with the myriad of leaflets.”Clare remains determined that no mother and family who have a baby with Down syndrome will leavehospital feeling as she did.“I have to leave the boxes in the maternity units and the midwives ask the mothershe wants one. I want them to hear ‘congratulations your baby is perfect’ because they are. “All our worries and concern about Aoe’s future were unfounded. We have a typical family le. “Yes Aoe takes longer to achieve her developmental milestones but she does achieve them. She has taught us all about patience and determination.“The gt baskets contain positive information about Down syndrome. They include a ‘Wouldn’t Change A Thing’ book which seeks to portray the true stories of positive, lived experience typical of the majority of real people with Down syndrome and their families. “There is a letter from me congratulating the new mum and basically saying it is overwhelming but it will be fine - actually better than fine, amazing! And of course the items for baby and items for mum. “I need help from shops and retailers and iniduals, financiallyand also through donating items suitable for the gt baskets.”To find out more and for links to the fund-raising page simply go to the Special Delivery NI page on Facebook.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA mum whose son was traumatised after being left alone in a room by his teachers wants the department to bring in minimum standards for Covid isolation in schools. Jessica BlackAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA mum whose son was traumatised after being left alone in a room by his teachers wants the department to bring in minimum standards for Covid isolation in schools.Current guidance requires children who show coronavirus symptoms to be taken from class and put in a room behind a closed door until they can be collected - but there are no restrictions on how these spaces are set up.Earlier this week a school in the Republic of Ireland was reported to have set aside a garden shed for kids to self isolate.The Co Tyrone woman, who asked for her name not to be used, said the practice should be standardised to protect pupils.Her son has become terried of being left alone after he was repeatedly taken from his classroom and left behind a locked door at his former school. The mum-of-two added: As a parent who has navigated a child through this pre-Covid I am aware of the seriousness of this issue.We had to remove doors from the house. He only recently got the bedroom door put back on his room but we can#t close it.The minimum should be a standard size, access to water and a window for ventilation.One child#s experience should not dfer from another due to #lack of space#. The Department of Educationhas previously updated its guidance to require adult supervision, and for schools to keep a record of whenever a child is isolated.Children#s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma welcomed the changes made so far - but said more clarity was needed.She also wants ventilation to be mandatory - instead of ideal, as the current guidance says.She added: I recognise iations in physical capacity and space across schools, however, emphasise the need for a consistent approach to be taken by schools when separating isolating symptomatic children until they are collected by a parent and that ventilation should be provided.A DoE spokeswoman said guidance was based on public health advice.It states: A child awaiting collection should be moved,possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door. Appropriate adult supervision must be provided. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation.She added: This allows schools the flexibility to manage cases as they arise on their sites, without being overly prescriptive. The Department will continue to keep the guidance under review, working closely with the sector.Department of Education guidance states: A ventilated space should be available for pupils  staff who become symptomatic to wait in until they can be collected or safely get home. Education settings may wish to draw on the broad principles illustrated in these examples to help inform bespoke local solutions. There should be no restriction on how spaces are configured to best support the educational needs of learners whilst adhering to social distancing requirements. Education settings will be best placed to consider the right approach for their own inidual circumstances.A child awaiting collection should be moved,possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door. Appropriate adult supervision must be provided.Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not possible to fully isolate the child, they should be moved to an area which is at least m away from other people.A risk assessment should be undertaken by the school to address this.Schools should fully document this process to ensure a record is held of who made the decision, who was contacted, who provided supervision and who picked up the child.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashCoronavirus cases reported at MS supermarket in Belfast and a Fermanagh nursery schoolBelfast#s George Best Hotel now #derelict# as brides miss out on dream weddingsDouble century as NI#s oldest couple celebrate another birthdayBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tony Stevens has come out of retirement to take up the post of interim chief executive of the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authorityfollowing the departure of Dermot Parsons. It comes after it emerged Mr Parsons threatened to resign from the top post at the height of the Covid- pandemic, claiming the Board of the RQIA had no confidence in his ability. Mr Parsons wrote to the Chief Medical OfficerMichael McBride in May stating he felt his position was untenable after the RQIA Board raised concerns over the decision to scale back care home visits during the pandemic. The board also expressed concerns about the redeployment of a number of RQIA#s senior executive team with critical loss of experience in the months before Mr Parsons was appointed interim chief executive. The row culminated in the mass resignation of the RQIA Board. The RQIA is the body tasked with ensuring healthcare providers such as hospitals and care homes meet minimum safety standards. A spokesman from the RQIA refused to say whether Mr Parsons remains with the organisation or provide an explanation for him stepping down as interim chief executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDermot Parsons FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDermot ParsonsHowever, Christine Collins, interim chair of the RQIA Board, said: I am delighted that Dr Stevens has agreed to take up post of interim chief executive at the RQIA on September . Dr Stevens brings considerable leadership experience and knowledge of the health and social care system, which will be invaluable as we reinforce and reshape the RQIA to face current and future challenges. Meanwhile, Dr Stevens said: I am pleased to be joining the experienced and dedicated team at RQIA at this challenging time for health and social care and the wider community. I look forward to leading RQIA in assuring the quality and safety of the health and social care services that people experience, and responding to the particular challenges that the current pandemic presents. Mr Stevens is the third person to be appointed as chief executive of the RQIA in six months. Olive Macleod stepped down as chief executive in March this year to take up the top job at the Public Health Agency. She was replaced by Mr Parsons who has now also left the job. The performance of the RQIA has come under the spotlight in recent years. It came under fire following a damning investigation into conditions at a care home in Dunmurry, which is currently at the centre of a police investigation. The Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland expressed concerns that the RQIA did not act quickly enough to protect residents at Dunmurry Manor, which has since been renamed Oak Tree Manor. And in June this year, Mr Parsons came under pressure to explain why he told the Stormont health committee in May that the RQIA was in agreement with a direction from the Department of Health to reduce care home inspections. In response to the question on the issue from chair Colm Gildernew, Mr Parsons said: Our approach towards that was agreement. However, in an email sent to CMO Dr Michael McBride on April , Mr Parsons referred to an appearance of a fundamental dference of approach between that promoted by the CMO, chief social worker and RQIA executive team members, and that upheld by the RQIA board. He continued: I would also be grateful for your urgent advice as I believe that my position as interim chief executive in RQIA may be untenable... I am content to step out of this roleit will help resolve this dilemma.In an email sent to Dr McBride on May , Mr Parsons reiterated a desire to resign: It is clear that RQIA Board does not have confidence in my performance in this role... I am unsure as to with whom I should discuss resignation... unfortunately I now believe my position is untenable.

There has been talk today about drive-through vaccinations andI do think this is the sort of infrastructure that we#re going to have to be looking at to deliver this in order to ensure there is the maximum uptake.Not everyone is going to feel safe about going into a clinical setting at the moment, so perhaps that will be more acceptable to people.On encouraging more front line health workers to get the flu jab, he added: Obviously the worry for them will be the impact of a potential second wave of coronavirus.So we need to make sure more people aren#t being sick for regular reasons, enabling them to be fully al to fight any second wave.It#s also vital they don#t have a lower immune system when working in clinical settings.On the scale of the challenge, he said: It#s no small obstacle, in Northern Ireland we#re looking at trying to get close to two million people immunised.So we will need large-scale, almost medical camps set up in places to access the vaccine. In a way it will also be a practice run for when we hopefully do get a Covid- vaccine.Mr McGrath said the fast response earlier this year to setting up a Nightingale hospital in Belfast was an encouraging sign.He added: When we put our minds to it I#m very sure that we can achieve massive things.I#ve every faith we can do that but we would certainly want to see evidence that we#re progressing towards that quickly.This week, experts have also warned that complacency over the flu jab could risk overwhelming the NHS across the United Kingdom.Analysis showed a decline among vulnerable groups in England to getting the vaccine.Local authorities in England had an average of % of people with serious health conditions under  getting the jab, a % drop since . In Northern Ireland the respective figure for vulnerable groups under- was % - the target here is %.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week: The vaccine is more vital than ever.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashCoronavirus cases reported at MS supermarket in Belfast and a Fermanagh nursery schoolBelfast#s George Best Hotel now #derelict# as brides miss out on dream weddingsDouble century as NI#s oldest couple celebrate another birthdayBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That#s  years or so they#ve known each other.After they married, Joe, who is a fanatical supporter of Ballymena United went with Nellie to live on a farm outside Randalstown before moving into the town where they both worked in the Old Bleach linen factory.Nellie, who will be  years young next May, said she did not know what the secret was to their longevity and she scoffed at claims from couples who insisted they never rowed.You can have an argument at any time of the day but you always make up after it,she said.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashCoronavirus cases reported at MS supermarket in Belfast and a Fermanagh nursery schoolBelfast#s George Best Hotel now #derelict# as brides miss out on dream weddingsDouble century as NI#s oldest couple celebrate another birthdayBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The union has warned this figure could rise even during .Last month a report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office said £m is spent every year on temporary staff to cover nursing shortages here.The RCN has said a recent survey of , RCN members showed % are thinking of leaving the profession this year, with over half citing pay as a factor.The union said it will continue to work with other health unions to call on all the devolved governments to provide nursing and health care staff with an early and substantive pay rise. Pat Cullen, director of the RCN NI, who warned in June that nurses couldto the picket line after holding strikes earlier this year for increased pay and better conditions, said wages for the profession must be attractive to secure safe nursing levels.Nurses in Northern Ireland are only too aware of the impact of not having enough nurses to care for patients, she said. This is why they took the dficult decision to take industrial action earlier this year and why we fought so hard for the guarantee that safe nurse staffing legislation would be implemented here.The union chief continued: We need to ensure that nursing remains an attractive profession and that we are training and retaining the right numbers of nurses in order to do this. The public have made it clear that they value the profession - we must ensure their pay reflects this. Dame Donna Kinnair, RCN chief executive and general secretary, insisted the campaign is about recognising the skill, experience and responsibility shown by all members of the nursing profession. This is about more than the profession#s response to Covid- - it is about increasing the attractiveness of the profession, to fill tens of thousands of unfilled nursing jobs and reach safe staffing levels. It is time to pay nursing staff fairly, she said.Meanwhile, Graham Revie, chair of the RCN#s trade union committee, said the pay demand reflects the knowledge, skills and responsibilities of the complex job we do. RCN members have told us they expect things to change, and we will fight for that change. The RCN is its members and together we can achieve fair pay for nursing, he said.Nursing... has been underfunded, understaffed and undervalued. The government should make the right choice now.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashCoronavirus cases reported at MS supermarket in Belfast and a Fermanagh nursery schoolBelfast#s George Best Hotel now #derelict# as brides miss out on dream weddingsDouble century as NI#s oldest couple celebrate another birthdayBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate. Anyone who is in need of help or support with addiction can contact Cuan Mhuire by phone on  or via email – newry@cuanmhuire.ie  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Oisiacuten Campbell achieved a triple distinction in Level  Extended Sports Diploma at Northern Regional College’s Magherafelt campus, the equilvalent of three A*s at A-Level. Next month, he will be begin to study Sports Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University, with the long-term goal of helping special needs athletes prepare mentally and phsyically for sport. “The College teams up with local sporting organisations, giving us the option of volunteering with them,” said Oisiacuten, who plays Gaelic Football for St Martins GAC in Desertmartin. googletag.cmd.push “This gives me the opportunity to work with some fantastic groups, including Magherafelt Marvels Special Olympics Clubs and Peace Players which promotes ersity through sport. “The practical sessions could sometimes push you out of your comfort zone which was always a good learning experience.” Oisiacutens was awarded the Inspirational Student of the Year award at the end of his first year at the College and while lockdown put sport on hold, he continued to volunteer with Magherafelt Marvels. “Volunteering with the Special Olypmics has given me greater confidence in my own ability and reinforced the importance of giving clear instructions and listering to others,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We kept in touch and posted home videos on Facebook so the athletes could continue their training at home during the lockdown.” Bronagh ONeill, Sports lecturer at Northern Regional College, said she was delighted with Oisiacutens success. “Oisin was a pleasure to have in the class and the accolade ‘Inspirational Student of the Year’ was so well deserved,” she said. “He was quite shy when he started the course, so it was great to watch him progress and grow in confidence. “He really benefited from volunteering with the Magherafelt Marvels but they have also benefited from his expertise and enthusiasm. I wish him every success at university and in his future career.“ Northern Regional College offers a range of full-time and part-time Sports courses.

Mrs Patricia Herron, Music Co-ordinator at St Eoghans Primary School, Draperstown, has watched Daras talent grow and develop from an early age. “He was maybe P or P when I realised that there might be a little voice in there that needs to be heard,” she told the County Derry Post. “The routine in our school would be that I askany children want to have a go at auditioning for a solo piece, so Dara would come up to the piano and this beautul, soft, quiet voice would come out. googletag.cmd.push “He sang solo at ious religious ceremonies as well, but it was really towards the end of P when his voice was developing so much more. “He was using a lot of ornamentation and trills and it came to light when he was singing an Irish song, with the traditional voice.” It was while singing an Irish song at his primary school show that the wider community began to take notice of the -year-olds phenomenal talent. Patricia recalled the moment his mum, Donna, was overcome with emotion watching her son hold an audience spellbound. “At that concert, when Dara sang the Irish song, I was sitting behind Donna,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “He hadnt sang it for his mammy purposely, and Donna just turned around and looked at me, and I looked at her, and there were tears in her eyes. I just nodded asto say, I told you so.” In a nod to the community ethos in Ballinascreen, Mrs Herron said the fact Dara is so grounded and kind is testament to his upbringing. “He is such a lovely young man, so mannerly and kind. Even when I watch him on The Voice, hes always worried about everybody ,” she said. Pupils and staff at his former primary school, St Eoghans, beside a poster in support of Dara McNicholl “His voice is an absolute gt, and a gt that he must share with the world, because anybody Ive spoken to just wishes him so much luck. “Behind that is a lovely young man, and we wish him all the best. Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki . Three weeks ago, David McNeilly, who now graces the ranks of the M category, ran a k PB of :and came home in : for a PB of  seconds dating back over seven years.Next clubman home was Niall Goodman in :, just three seconds outside the time he set at Eikon, he was slightly disappointed but the run consolidates the improvement he has made this year. The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago.

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point. Savage kept pushing lsquoFord forward, using his experience to encourage those around him, and he knocked over their eighth score of the contest.Barely  seconds later it was Savage again scoring to give lsquoFord some real hope. That set up something of a tense finish to the contest when it had looked like it would be anything but.Twenty four minutes into the second half, Savage again was the commander-in-chief of the counter-offensive, making it three points in a row for Bryansford to cut the scoreline to - to -.A free gave Bryansford and Savage the chance to leave just a goal between the sides, and he made no mistakes, confidently floating his effort between the sticks, continuing his spell as a one-man danger to Clonduffrsquos superiority.However, as the clock began to become the enemy of lsquoFord, Clonduffrsquos Tom Close pointed from play to give Clonduff that crucial lead of four ahead again.Cathal Burns curled a neat point over the bar for Bryansford going into injury time to make it - to -.Then came a moment to stun Clonduff when Bryansford found a goal.

Pictured are favourites Sue Gray and Peter MayIn a circular process, mandarins were then chosen by the Senior Appointments Selection Committee, a body itself made up of the most senior civil servants, each of whom was selected for the committee by the Head of the Civil Service, who was in turn advised by the committee.Jobs were neither applied for nor CVs reviewed, with the acerbic observation that “few senior officials have ever drawn up their own CVs or would know how to do so”.Despite criticism that such a situationwas untenable in a modern democracy, Plowden, an academic who was himself a former civil servant, said in his  book Ministers and Mandarins that it represented “a powerful symbol of the traditional civil service” which “reflects the confidence of the civil service as a profession in its own judgements about its own future and about the national interest, and about the congruence between the two”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...As with much of le in Northern Ireland, things here have always been slightly dferent.But until recently two broad elements of Plowden’s analysis of the Whitehall machine would have been largely analogous – civil servants had enormous power in choosing each other for the top posts, and that practice was a manestation of a government bureaucracy which was firmly self-confident.Where the confidence of Whitehall mandarins could be traced back to their predecessors who had run an empire, the confidence of Stormont’s officials had been forged in their knowledge thatit was the fledgling Northern Ireland Civil Service which – as much as the politicians of the Ulster Unionist Party – had built Northern Ireland and had been critical to sustaining it throughoutthe Troubles.For decades as Northern Ireland burned, as blood ran in the streets and as politicians proved incapable of finding workable governmental arrangements, it was the quiet bureaucrats of the Civil Service – as much as the military might of the Army, the resolve of the police or the restraining influence of churches – which held society together when it could have imploded into outright and uncontainable chaos.But now, on the eve of Northern Ireland’s centenary, the institution which in the years after  was central to making the new creation work when so many expected it to fail is now battered and a byword for irreformable ineptitude.The RHI scandal brought to view long-buried incompetence, along with new problems – officials’ limp subservience to their political masters’, a culture of deliberately not taking minutes or even recording who took major decisionsthey believed it might embarrass their ministers, and incompetence so extreme as to be scarcely believable.But as the chairman of the public inquiry into that scandal, Sir Patrick Coghlin, repeatedly noted during its hearings, many of the indefensible activities revealed by cash for ash had been raised time and time again by the Audit Office and the Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee, and assurances had been given by senior civil servants that “lessons will be learned”.They weren’t, and by failing to weed out incompetence in their ranks and speak truth to power, now Stormont’smandarins are greatly diminished – a collective punishment in which honourableand competent officials are now paying for the sins of their colleagues.The fact that in monetary terms not a single civil servant of any rank has yet lost a penny, much less their jobs, as a result of RHI does little to convince the public that this is an institution capable of holding itself to account .All of this is relevant because on Wednesday the first interviews of those who have applied to succeed David Sterling – who was implicated in the practices revealed by the RHI scandal – as Head of the Civil Service were conducted. According to a source, five internal candidates were interviewed – Sue Gray, Peter May, Richard Pengelly, DenisMcMahon, and Hugh Widdis – along with at least one external candidate.The identity of the external candidate or candidates remains unclear. Another source said that at least one senior DUP figure had wanted Francis Campbell, an Ulster-born former British diplomat who served as Ambassador to the Vatican, to apply for the post.The fact that Mr Campbell is a devout Catholic may make that seem surprising to those whose view of the DUP is as inflexiblysectarian party but it would in many ways be entirely logical – not only is the -year-old Rathfriland man a highly regarded bureaucrat and spoken of as a person of integrity, but the DUP has enthusiastically endorsed other senior appointments of Catholics, most notably that of John Larkin as Attorney General.It is unclear whether Mr Campbell – who earlier this year went to Australia to be vice chancellor of Notre Dame University – is even interested in the post, but the appointment of a Northern Ireland Catholic as head of the Civil Service would powerfully symbolise how this society has changed since .Until now, the Head of the Civil Service has – as in Whitehall – almost iniably been an internal promotion. But it is indicative of the shrunken authority of the civil service that internal candidates now probably begin with a handicap in a situation where the central requirement for the post will be to reform the institution.Multiple Stormont sources point to Department of Justice permanent secretary Peter May as the pre-eminent internal candidate and the closest to a continuity candidate of those most likely to get thejob.Department of Health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly is another strong and experienced candidate butthe fact that he is married to not only a senior DUP figure but one who is the special adviser to the First Minister in the department he would then lead is at least a complicating factor in a post requiring not just actual neutrality but the perception of neutrality.However, experienced Stormont figures largely agree that the clear favourite is Department of Finance permanent secretary Sue Gray.Despite that title, she is very much an outsider, having suddenly and unexpectedly arrived months after the RHI Inquiry had begun to reveal Stormont’s entrails and to some shrewd observers it appeared that Whitehall was putting one of its most senior figures in the Stormont department which controls the budget at a time when the culture of ‘free money’ was being laid bare.In person, she is warm and unstuffily personable, a sort of bureaucratic Mo Mowlam unwilling to accept conventionit cannot be cogently defended.To some, she is therefore a crusading reformer belatedly bringing reluctant officials into the st century and they see the fact that she has unsettled some of her new colleagues as evidence of that.But to others, her words too often don’t match her actions – especially around the secrecy which has long surrounded how she operates, a major problemshe is the person to reform a civil service whose aversion to openness was revealed by RHI to have been such a liability.Mrs Gray has a remarkable and atypical background. During the Troubles – in what The Sunday Times later described as “an unusual ‘career break’ in the s” – she came from London take over the Cove Bar on the Hilltown Road between Newry and Mayobridge, less than ten miles from the border, with her husband, Portaferry-born country and western singer Bill Conlon.If Mrs Gray did get the job, it would represent the shattering of another glass ceiling for women and would for the first time see a triumvirate of women in Stormont Castle’s most senior roles.However, all this speculation may be academic. Several years ago the rules on choosing the Head of the Civil Service were changed to give the First Minister and deputy First Minister full final say on who is appointed.Therefore, with this huge choice ultimately in the hands of Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, they will get who they want – unless, as is not infrequent, they cannot agree.Read More Read MorePay hike as Executive makes last-minute search for top civil servantPowerful official working to end Stormont secrecy presided over suppressing materialConor Murphy’s top civil servant also answerable to Cabinet Office ministers________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public -

Peter Cardwell at Hillsborough Castle.“I hope the book is a fun, frank and honest account of what it’s like to work in Westminster.”It’s his first time as an author and already his book has set tongues wagging across social media.Special advisers are a part of the government, yet who they are and what they do is much misunderstood. Key advisers to Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister since the s, their role is shrouded in mystery, despite acres of newsprint devoted to high-profile members of the cohort, such as Alastair Campbell and Dominic Cummings.Peter Cardwell’s book lts the lid on the people Piers Morgan called ‘these miserable little creatures’, revealing who spads are, how Cabinet ministers use and interact with them, how much influence they have and how they deal with the civil service. Featuring numerous anecdotes from dealing with counter-terror emergencies in COBRA to explaining what a dental dam is to the Justice Secretary, to having your inside leg measured in a Minister of the Crown’s office, this book has it all.BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said: “Peter allows you to peep behind the curtain of a much caricatured but little understood part of our political universe. With the structures of government in flux it’s a timely look at how some of the key relationships in Westminster work, and how they sometimes misfire.”Michael Crick, veteran political journalist and investigative authorsaid: “A book we have long needed.Peter Cardwell’s book fizzes with stories and humour from his experience as an adviser to four dferent ministers, and his years as a Westminster journalist with BBC Newsnight, ITV and Sky News.”https:www.portadowntimes news uk-news ni-man-peter-cardwell-loses-job-boris-johnson-reshuffle-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cadcacaccdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbbbdefed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cadcacaccdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbbbdefed   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
