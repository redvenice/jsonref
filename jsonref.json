In the 1920s, instead of people saying \u0027woe is me\u0027, they celebrated and looked fabulous doing it.

A beautiful fragrance or lipstick can make you feel wow.\u0027The \u0027Roaring Twenties\u0027, when people defied society\u0027s conventions by wearing daring fashions and holding wild parties, was most famously chronicled in F Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s novel The Great Gatsby. \u0027It was an age of miracles,\u0027 the novelist once wrote. \u0027It was an age of art, it was an age of excess.\u0027Cosmetic sales have plummeted during the coronavirus crisis as store closures, coupled with the shift to homeworking, prompted many women to ditch make-up with sales of foundation and lipstick plunging during the original lockdown by more than 70 per cent. But Lesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy And Cosmetology, believes the cosmetics industry will prosper post-lockdown.\u0027There will be an absolute boom when this nightmare is over,\u0027 she said. \u0027We will be buying more than we\u0027ve ever bought before.

This follows India being added to the UK’s red list for travel, as it battles a devastating rise in infections and a new variant of coronavirus that has spread to other countries including the UK.  Our main Covid-19 liveblog reports that India has recorded 1.59m cases in the last week alone -- with “record daily case numbers overwhelming already stretched hospitals and medical supplies”. Cyrille Lenoël, senior UK economist at NIESR, points out that employment rose month-on-month in February (and in January, although because it fell in December employment was slightly lower in December-February, quarter-on-quarter):  Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says the UK jobs market seems to be ‘turning a corner’, partly thanks to the furlough scheme: And on vacancies, Parikh predicts there will be “significant growth in new positions over the spring and summer”, barring a return to tighter restrictions. Its single-month vacancy estimates show there were 650,000 vacancies last month, up from 562,000 in February, suggesting a pick-up in hiring ahead of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions. That’s a more positive picture than in the quarterly data, which showed a rather smaller improvement (which we covered earlier), due to the drop in vacancies earlier in the lockdown. The Competition and Markets Authority says it has concerns about the takeover of the supermarket chain. That’s because Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR also own EG Group, which operates 395 petrol stations in the UK, while Asda owns 323.  Many of Asda’s and EG’s petrol stations are located in the same parts of the UK, the CM says. Thus, the deal raises local competition concerns about supply of road fuel in 36 areas across the UK and the supply of automatic liquified petroleum gas in another area.  The CMA has given the buyers five working days to provide legally binding proposals to address this, and avoid an in-depth investigation. Joel Bamford, Senior Director of Mergers, said: It’s a busy time for EG Group - on Sunday, it announced the purchase of healthy fast food chain Leon for £100m, as part of a strategy to turn their petrol stations into mini shopping centres. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Biden administration is considering requiring tobacco companies to lower the nicotine in all cigarettes sold in the U.S. to levels at which they are no longer addictive. The move could help Americans to quit, or encourage them to move onto less harmful alternatives. The Journal adds that the White House is also pondering a ban on menthol cigarettes - to curb young people getting the habit: The pound traded as high as $1.4009, its highest since early March, adding to strong gains yesterday when the US dollar was broadly weaker.

We just need Minnesota to make the right decision.” Floyd also called on Americans to remain “peaceful” as they await the verdict in the trial. “People are in pain, they’re hurt,” Floyd said, noting Daunte Wright was fatally shot by police about 10 miles from the courtroom. “We stand in solidarity with everybody across America.”“National guard, go home!” hundreds of teenagers chanted in a heavily fortified Minneapolis on Monday, as part of statewide high school walkouts over the police killings of Daunte Wright and George Floyd. In neighboring Saint Paul, more than a hundred students took their grievances over police brutality to the capitol, where lawmakers inside the fenced-in statehouse could be seen peeking out through the curtains to look at protesters outside. The high school walkouts against racial injustice and police brutality took place as a Minneapolis court was hearing closing arguments in the Derek Chauvin murder trial. The city was bracing for the verdict, with hundreds of national guard soldiers deployed. The student protests were organized on Instagram by Minnesota Teen Activists, a local group founded after the George Floyd protests last summer. Students from at least 110 schools across Minnesota had planned protests to honor Daunte Wright on Monday, the group said. At 1.47 pm, the time Daunte Wright was shot eight days before, hundreds of Minneapolis teenagers sat together on the ground to mark three minutes of silence. A light snow had been falling, and their faces were grim. Biden will later participate in a virtual tour of the Proterra electric battery facility in South Carolina and deliver remarks on his infrastructure plan at the White House. The White House said yesterday that the virtual tour is meant to highlight the need for zero-emission transit buses and school buses. “There are over 475,000 school buses and 65,000 transit buses on our streets today, serving millions of students and transit riders. Most of these buses currently run on diesel, which has a negative impact on human health, especially for children,” the White House said in its statement yesterday. “The President made a commitment that all American-made buses would be zero-emission by 2030. To advance this goal, the American Jobs Plan includes a total of $45 billion to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission transit buses and school buses. This investment will create good jobs, support domestic manufacturing, tackle a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and improve health for some of our most vulnerable populations.”Tensions are high in Minneapolis, with hundreds of national guard soldiers deployed. Last year, video of the former police officer’s alleged killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, prompted days of protests, riots and looting, and demonstrations across the US and world. Protests flared up again earlier this month, over the shooting of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, by officers during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb. Many Americans have reached their own verdict in the Chauvin case, and see the trial as part of a reckoning in the broader struggle for racial justice. Nonetheless, on Monday lawyers focused on persuading the jury. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said the key to the case lay in video footage of Chauvin pressing his knee on to Floyd’s neck even as he pleaded for his life, right to his very last words of “I can’t breathe”. “This case is exactly what you saw with your eyes. It’s what you know in your heart,” he said. Tensions are high in the nation’s capital as the country awaits a verdict in the Derek Chauvin murder trial. The jury in Minneapolis began its deliberations yesterday to determine whether Chauvin is guilty of murdering George Floyd, who died after Chauvin kept his knee on the Black man’s neck for more than nine minutes. The killing of Floyd set off widespread protests last May, and Washington is bracing for another round of demonstrations if the jury does not find Chauvin guilty. The DC National Guard announced yesterday it is activating 250 troops to assist the politan Police Department of Washington as it prepares for the potential protests. Parking restrictions and street closures go into effect today in downtown DC as well. In a statement announcing the activation of the guard troops, Brigadier General Aaron R Dean II, the adjutant general of the DC National Guard, said the city is dedicated to providing a “safe environment for our fellow citizens to exercise their first amendment right”. “This is our home, and we are dedicated to the safety and security of our fellow citizens of the District and their right to safely and peacefully protest,” Dean said.

Last week, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson halted its European roll-out of the vaccine after U.S. officials recommended a pause in the vaccine, after detecting six very rare blood clot cases among nearly 7 million people who had been vaccinated. European officials said they considered all currently available evidence from the U.S., including eight reports of serious cases of rare blood clots associated with low blood platelets, including one death. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson advised European governments to store their doses until the EU drug regulator issued guidance on their use widespread use of the shot in Europe has not yet started. The delay is a further blow to vaccination efforts in the European Union, which have been plagued by supply shortages, logistical problems, and concerns over blood clots from those who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.Gandhi, 50, said in a tweet on Tuesday “All those who’ve been in contact with me recently, please follow all safety protocols and stay safe.”  Gandhi last week called off political rallies in West Bengal state where provincial elections are being held. On Monday, another Congress party leader and former prime minister, Manmohan Singh, also tested positive. He has been hospitalised as a precaution, citing a mild fever on Sunday. India’s Health Ministry reported 259,170 new infections and 1,761 deaths on Tuesday. The country has reported daily infections above the 200,000 mark for six days.Russia’s Baikal-Amur Mainline railway is being extended to transport more coal and metal cargo to ports for export to Asia in a construction project costed at around six trillion rouble ($79 billion). However, the pandemic has seen vast numbers of migrant workers leave the country over the last year. Citing police data, the Tass agency said last year numbers fell to 5.5 million from at least nine million previously. Andrei Makarov, deputy general director at Russian Railways, said the state company that runs the national rail network is short of between 3,000 to 4,000 workers due to the pandemic.The TousAntiCovid app, part of the country’s contact-tracing programme, has been upgraded to store negative Covid-19 test results on travellers’ mobile phones and is being trialled on flights to Corsica and overseas départements from this week. The trial will be extended from 29 April to include vaccination certificates, officials told Le Monde, and the system could eventually be adopted for public events such as concerts, festivals and trade fairs, although not for bars and restaurants. Infections have continued to rise in Maharashtra, home to the financial capital Mumbai, despite restrictions imposed earlier this month, state health minister Rajesh Tope said. The new lockdown will “be like last year,” Tope said. The state also plans to import vaccines to hasten the vaccine rollout, he said. India has registered more than 3 million new infections and 18,000 deaths this month, AFP reports, ,making its caseload second only to the US. Roger Green, a British writer who has lived on the island since the early 1990s, says some expats are afraid to leave their homes. “The vaccination process has passed us by,” he said. “I know people like me who are in their 80s and are afraid to go out at all. We’re not complainers, we love Greece, but for most foreigners here, at least, the system isn’t working.” Hydra is far from alone. In a country that has linked its inoculation drive to ownership of a social security (AMKA) number, countless overseas residents have reported being in the same predicament. Although desperate to have the jab, many say that, without the number, they’ve been unable even to get to the stage where they can book a vaccine appointment. Helena Smith and Sam Jones report: “People under the age of 65 who have already received a dose of Vaxzevria should instead be offered a second dose of so-called mRNA vaccine, such as PfizerBiontech or Moderna,” the health agency said in a statement reported by Reuters. Sweden suspended its use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March after reports of very rare blood clots among people who had received the jab. Sweden later resumed use but only for people aged 65 or above. Last week, the country announced it would pause plans to start vaccinations using Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s vaccine following reports of rare blood clots similar to those reported with AstraZeneca’s shot.The figure, calculated by Reuters, is based on the fact that there are around 551,000 active cases in the country which has a working age population of about 57 million. It factored in official death tolls, recoveries and total cases. In the last two days, only India – with a population of more than 1.36 billion – has surpassed Turkey’s number of cases. When taking a slightly longer view with a seven-day rolling average, Reuters data shows India ranks fourth globally in new cases. It comes as deaths hit the record figure of 341 on Monday, despite more than 20m vaccines doses having been administered, including nearly 8m second shots. Turkey has relied on Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine, adding Pfizer’s jab to its supplies this month. The required test packages cost about £100 – often pricier than the cost of a short-haul flight. “Nobody will object to having systems in place to protect health and making sure that people can travel safely. But everybody should object when we see evidence of people being ripped off,” IATA boss Willie Walsh said during an online conference, AFP reports. “This is nonsense. It’s a scam, let’s call it what it is,” he added, warning that “we can’t have a situation where only the wealthy are in a position to travel”.France’s vaccine rollout has picked up speed in recent weeks after a slow start due to supply issues. An Israeli statement said Israeli foreign minister Gabi Ashkenazi and British cabinet office minister Michael Gove discussed the possibility during a meeting Jerusalem. “We will promote, together with the UK, mutual recognition of vaccines in order to allow tourists and business people from both countries to safely return to their routines,” the statement quoted Ashkenazi as saying. No timeline has been given for the “green travel corridor” as of yet. It is understood that the measure would only apply to vaccinated travellers. Israel last week said it will start allowing entry to some vaccinated tourists as of 23 May after shutting its borders at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.The application comes after India announced last week it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines that have been granted emergency authorisation in other countries. Vaccines authorised by the World Health Organization or in the US, the EU, the UK and Japan “may be granted emergency use approval in India, mandating the requirement of post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial”, the health ministry previously said in a statement. India is facing a dramatic surge in cases and a new variant of coronavirus that has spread to other countries. The variant, named B.1.617, is understood to have spread in the western state of Maharashtra between December 2020 and March this year. The king approved prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s move to place the country into a state of emergency due to the coronavirus crisis in January, but opponents say it was used as a pretext to fend off criticism. Parliament is suspended to 1 August and the government is able to pass laws without parliamentary oversight. The opposition’s charge is being led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, 95, who has submitted a petition for the king to end the emergency. More than 39,000 Malaysians have signed the online petition. “This declaration of a state of emergency is not about fighting Covid-19. Not at all … it is about a weak government wanting to stay in power,” Mahathir wrote on his blog. The government’s critics also say that the state of emergency has failed to curb infections, with Malaysia’s total cases more than doubling to over 379,000 since January. Although parliament has remained suspended since January, retail and schools have since been reopened. Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next few hours.

Bars and restaurants will be allowed to gradually reopen next week. Prime minister Mark Rutte is set to announce the measures at a news conference planned for 1900 CET (1700 GMT). The Netherlands has been in varying stages of lockdown for more than six months, as all bars and restaurants have been closed since mid-October and public gatherings of more than two people are banned. Since the start of the pandemic more than 1.4 million coronavirus infections have been confirmed in the Netherlands, with more than 20,000 deaths. Opinion polls have shown support for lockdown measures is waning, and hospitality associations and mayors from major cities have argued that the ban on outdoor dining spaces should be removed immediately, citing large numbers of people gathering in parks.“Fifty-three factories are producing vaccines in the EU. Our continent is now the largest producer in the world after the United States,” internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton told French daily Le Figaro in an interview. Agence France-Presse notes that EU governments have faced fierce criticism over the bloc’s joint vaccine procurement efforts, which saw a slow start to its inoculation drive even as programmes raced ahead in Britain and the US. Already half of American adults have had at least one dose, and as of Monday anyone over 18 can sign up for a shot. In the EU, by contrast, just over 20 percent of adults have received at least one jab, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Breton insisted Europe would catch up in the coming months, with production capacity “that will reach 200m doses a month by this summer”. But he poured cold water on the idea of using Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine anytime soon. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is evaluating Sputnik’s safety and efficiency, but “it still lacks some essential data,” Breton said. And even if approved, “we’ll have to find production capacity, because the Russians do not have large production sites and are looking for industrial partners in Europe which are already fully mobilised. For all these reasons, I don’t think significant quantities of Sputnik will be available for Europe before the end of 2021,” he said.Federal health department officials revealed on Tuesday that aged care residents had been prioritised meaning residents of 6,000 disability care facilities were yet to receive even one dose. The department secretary, Prof Brendan Murphy, confirmed at the Senate Covid-19 inquiry that Australia was still aiming to vaccinate its entire vulnerable population by mid-year. But he refused to provide updated targets for the broader vaccination program citing increased hesitancy and uncertainty of supply. Murphy conceded a warning against giving AstraZeneca to people aged under 50 due to rare blood clots has caused a rise in vaccine hesitancy, although the chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, argued this was also being driven by decreasing rates of people believing they were at risk of contracting Covid-19. The Covid-19 inquiry hearing comes as Australia’s vaccination program is being redesigned, with a plan to accelerate the rollout for over 50 year olds set to be approved at national cabinet on Thursday. Australia’s rollout is structured by priority cohorts, starting with the 1a group that includes quarantine and front-line health workers along with aged and disability care workers and residents. "},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 240,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,800 people have died.Globally, over 140 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 88\u0026nbspdifferent vaccines in clinical development, with another 184 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top four cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople aged 65 to 69 who are at high risk (cohort 5), other people aged 65-69 (cohort 6) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

The recommended interval for the two doses of this vaccine is 12 weeks.The UK government decided at the outset to maintain a 12-week gap between the two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to protect a greater number of people, to reduce deaths and ease pressure on the country’s health system as the country battled a third wave of infections.Analysis of data from clinical trials on more than 17,000 participants in the UK, Brazil and South Africa found that the 12-week gap was better than a six-week gap: the vaccine was 81 per cent effective over 12 weeks compared with 55 per cent over six weeks. Even a single dose of the vaccine was 76 per cent effective between three and 12 weeks after it was administered.RecommendationThe decision here rests on the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is awaiting a recommendation in the coming days on whether to extend the interval between the two doses from four weeks to a longer period of up to 12 weeks.Experts see upsides and downsides to a change.“As long as the supply of vaccines is secure, we should give all the vaccines out – don’t hold any back,” said Trinity College Dublin immunology professor Luke O’Neill, pushing for a longer interval that will reach the end-of-June first-dose target of 80 per cent of adults by the end of May.“The idea is basically to get to as many people as quickly as possible because it will have a bigger impact, because you are covering more people in a given period of time.”University College Dublin professor and infectious diseases consultant Paddy Mallon sees benefits in extending the interval window but said the overall strategy is to keep transmission low while fully vaccinating (with two doses) as many people as possible to prevent new variants coming in.“I don’t know that there is a right answer because both options have a lot of benefit,” he said.He points out that the State is “well on the way” to fully vaccinating people most at risk of severe disease from Covid-19 and that the benefits from changing the interval period would only amount to a gain of weeks given the projected supply of vaccines due into the country.“If you were wanting to ensure that your population has the best protection against new variants, you would really be wanting to optimise the overall immune response, which would be best achieved by getting people fully vaccinated,” he said.In addition to potentially confusing people by making vaccinations more complicated, Anthony Staines, professor of health systems at Dublin City University, said extending the interval could leave the population more susceptible to vaccine-resistant strains being imported.“If we get vaccine-resistant strains circulating in Europe, a bunch of half-vaccinated people are an ideal place for it to spread,” he said.Vaccine specialist Anne Moore, a senior lecturer at University College Cork’s school of biochemistry, said the Government should stick with the plan and the clinical trial evidence supporting the current dose interval, particularly when mRNA vaccines were going to be supplied in larger numbers.“We may be trying to solve a problem that actually isn’t a problem at all,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"flexibility required to avoid wasting left over vaccines hse","story":" ‘The HSE recognises that it can be challenging to access people on reserve lists quickly and that doses should not be wasted.’ Photograph: Luis AcostaAFP via GettyA new guidance note on vaccinations issued by Health Service Executive (HSE) chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry has acknowledged it can be difficult to locate people on reserve lists quickly if there are extra doses left at the end of the day.In the first official confirmation that clinicians should adopt a practical, fair and common-sense approach to leftover doses, Dr Henry has issued clinical guidance that states the HSE will support vaccine centres that make “reasonable” decisions.“There are circumstances where flexibility is required to ensure that vaccines are not wasted,” he said.However, the note also explicitly cautions that nobody should be selected on the basis of their professional role (if it is not a priority role) or on the basis of family, personal or social association with the vaccination team.The guidance says vaccination teams should have made plans to avoid waste by creating reserve lists.“The vaccination centres should have a reserve list of people who can be contacted at short notice and who are likely to be available to accept vaccination when doses remain in (punctured) vials, or are about to reach their use-before-time, and would otherwise be discarded.”Dr Henry has specified that the reserve list should prioritise people who are close in sequence for vaccination to the group currently receiving doses.However, the note continues: “The HSE recognises that it can be challenging to access people on reserve lists quickly and that doses should not be wasted. We will support vaccine centres that make a reasonable decision to administer vaccines to eligible iniduals who have an identifiable risk factor of severe disease or who are at relatively high risk because they are close in age range to an age cohort currently intended to be vaccinated.”It states the reserve lists should not include anyone selected solely on a professional role (if it is not prioritised) or on the basis of family, personal social or business connections with a staff member.The updated guidance follows a series of controversies where spare vaccine doses were allocated to people who were not in priority groups. The Beacon Hospital Group has launched an inquiry following the disclosure it allocated spare doses to teachers of the private St Gerard’s School in Co Wicklow. In January, it emerged that members of the family of the Master of the Coombe Maternity Hospital, Prof Michael O’Connell, had received the vaccine. More recently the Mater Hospital defended the offer of vaccines to its own board saying it was “an integral part of the functioning of the hospital and this has been particularly the case during Covid-19”.The hospital said some board members were front-line medical staff and some of the non-executive directors were required to attend the hospital in person. Its decision to offer vaccines to the board was consistent with all staff at the hospital receiving vaccines, it said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet to wait for ema decision before updating advice on spreading out vaccine doses","story":"Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has urged all over 60s to take the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine if offered it, saying it works effectively against the B117 variant, the most common coronavirus variant in Ireland currently.

However, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said there was no point in updating advice until the EMA advises on the use of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine later this week.The agency has been considering the use of the vaccine after a small number of cases of very rare blood clots was reported in the US.Nphet will issue advice when the EMA has reported and its recommendation is incorporated into the Irish vaccine rollout, Dr Glynn said.Extending the interval between doses would mean the rollout takes longer to complete and more people would be waiting longer for full protection, he pointed out.The ongoing improvement in Covid-19 figures continues, according to Dr Glynn.Case numbers fell last week by 7 per cent, on top of a 22 per cent fall the previous week.The improvements are being seen across all age groups, he said.Nphet reported no further deaths of Covid-19 patients, and an additional 403 cases on Monday. Up to Saturday, 1,204,063 doses of vaccine had been administered 852,189 first doses and 351,874 second doses.Of the new Covid-19 cases, 174 are in Dublin, 34 in Meath, 20 in Kildare, 18 in Mayo, 16 in Cork, with the remaining 141 cases spread across 20 other counties.The 14-day incidence of the disease now stands at 115 cases per 100,000 people nationally.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillTwo fully vaccinated staff members at Dealgan House nursing home in Dundalk, Co Louth have tested positive for Covid-19 during routine testing of nursing home staff.The outbreak has led to the suspension of indoor visits at the nursing home. Dealgan House nursing home said that the two employees had received positive results as part of routine serial testing carried out on a fortnightly basis at the nursing home.“Both staff members were fully vaccinated, receiving their second doses in February and neither have symptoms of any sort,” said the nursing home in a statement.“All residents of the nursing home are fully vaccinated. We have temporarily suspended visiting pending advice from public health.”The second and final doses of the vaccine were administered to residents and staff of Dealgan House in the first week in February when the nursing home’s chief executive Eoin Farrelly said that he hoped that the nursing home had “seen the back of this dreadful disease.”Deaglan House was one of the worst affected in the country during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic when 22 residents died in an outbreak a year ago.Covid-19 vaccines prevent severe disease and death but people can still test positive for the virus after being fully inoculated, despite having high levels of protection from serious illness.“It is possible to contract Covid after being fully vaccinated. It is not see as a vaccine failure unless you are very sick,” said a health sector source.“It is not 100 per cent that you wouldn’t get Covid it is just that you would not get very sick.” Sinn Féin TD for Louth Ruairí Ó Murchú called for the HSE and public health doctors to “engage straight away” and test all residents at the 82-bed nursing home after the positive cases. “We are obviously aware that the efficacy rates on the vaccines are never 100 per cent. The fact that these people are asymptomatic would lead you to believe that the vaccines have been very successful in avoiding serious sickness, hospitalisation or worse,” he said.“But this is a warning to all of us that even with the vaccination rollout we need to follow the precautions in relation to social distancing and public health measures.” Typically, public health doctors carry out a risk assessment of a nursing home before deciding whether all residents of the facility have to be tested following positive cases among staff. Mr Ó Murchú said the HSE needed to carry out “trace back” testing to see where the infections came from and genomic sequencing to see if the cases are linked to new variants of concern.Last year’s outbreak at Dealgan House left the nursing home short of staff as it struggled to manage the virus with the HSE even contemplating calling in the Defence Forces and the Red Cross to help at one point. The RCSI Hospital Group temporarily stepped in to run the home. Vaccinations and lockdown restrictions have led to a dramatic fall in the number of Covid-19 cases and outbreaks recorded in nursing homes and other residential care facilities. The outbreak in Dealgan House comes after no new nursing home outbreaks were reported in the week to April 10th - the first week with no reported outbreaks of the disease since last year. The positivity rate in serial testing of nursing home staff has fallen to 0.1 per cent - a level last experienced in July - from a high of 2.3 per cent in January at the peak of the third wave.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireAn explosive device has been found under the vehicle of a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) at a rural property just outside Dungiven, Co Derry, security sources have said.The North’s First Minister Arlene Foster has blamed dissident republicans for the bomb attack on the female PSNI staff member. The security alert at Ballyquin Road, Dungiven, is continuing. A cylinder-type device had been left under the officer’s car. It was later made safe by British army bomb experts. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan confirmed the device was viable, and said investigations were ongoing to establish the full circumstances. “We are treating this as an attack on a member of staff who also serves her community as a part-time police officer,” he said. In a joint statement on Tuesday afternoon, the North’s First and Deputy First Ministers, DUP leader Ms Foster and Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin, condemned the attempt on the woman’s life. “This is a shameful and vile attack on a police officer and I utterly condemn those responsible,” Ms Foster said. “All right-thinking people will reject those who try to drag us back into violence through such cowardly deeds. “People across Northern Ireland will unite in agreement that this barbarity has no place in today’s society and that this dark and sinister agenda is a thing of the past, not our future.” Ms O’Neill said it was a “shocking and deplorable attempt on the life of a police officer that will rightly be reviled across the community. My thoughts are very much with the police officer concerned and her family. “Those behind this reckless attack have absolutely nothing to offer society and have shown a callous disregard for the entire community. They seek only to drag our communities backwards they have no place in our society and they should disband,” she said. The chair of the representative body the Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI), Mark Lindsay, said it was “appalling” the officer had been singled out in this manner, and her dedication to serving the community was in “stark contrast to those involved in this attack, whose only purpose is to wreck lives.” He said there were “people in this community who know who planned this attack and placed this potentially lethal device under an officer’s car. “They must realise there is nothing to be gained by such attacks and I would call on them to give the police the information they need to capture the culprits.” The attack was also condemned by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken, who said there must be “no hiding place for those who seek to murder police officers or use violence in pursuit of any political objectives.” He said they had raised a concern that given that dissident republicans were being “heavily monitored” in Derry City, “they would attempt to extend their violent activities to this area and members of the Police and security force family would be their targets. “Today’s events has reinforced our fears and turned them into reality,” he said. “Our thoughts are with this officer and her family and we make a plea for anyone who has any scrap of evidence that they come forward to ensure that the perpetrators behind this latest action are caught and dealt with.” SDLP MLA Cara Hunter also condemned the attack. “No one should have to live in fear of going to work,” she said. “Our officers protect our communities every day and keep them safe. My thoughts are with the officer and their families,” Ms Hunter said. - Additional reporting PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"details of new road tunnel at glen of the downs released","story":"The new Purple Route would see traffic between Dublin and Wexford ert into the tunnel under some 20 local houses.

The route corridor also passes below the Norman Downs village and fair green, the 15th-century St Mary’s Church, and a ninth-century ring fort overlooking the Glen itself.At the northern end of the Glen the tunnel would emerge north of the local Red Lane, where it would rejoin the existing M11N11.Consultants Arup working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland’s regional roads office have come up with the design having discounted some earlier options, including two possible routes across Delgany Golf Club.Details of the tunnel route were added to the project website last week under the heading Phase 2 short-listed corridors. Consideration of a tunnel was first mentioned in an update to the project website in December 2020, when the extent of difficulties with other route options became apparent.Three options now remain on the project shortlist are:– To widen the existing route along the Glen floor. This is considered controversial as it would require a further slice off the nature reserve, a Special Area of Conservation which is protected under EU law. Widening the route to a dual carriageway sparked a three-year protest by eco-campaigners some 20 years ago.– A route high on the western side of the Glen known as the Cyan Route. This route is considered punitively expensive as it is 7.9km long. It contains a number of bends as it hugs the contours of Downshill. This route may also attract objections on heritage and environmental grounds given the presence of a pre-historic hillfort on Downshill.– The tunnel route, while costly, would avoid much of the issues raised by other options.HeritageA spokesman for the design team said the approach to the project was an incremental one. He said the first options would have been the simplest and most straightforward, and as each one was ruled out the more expensive and complex options were being investigated.The tunnel option has already received a positive response from heritage enthusiasts. Founder of the website glenodownsheritage Jasime Fortune, who has researched and published much of the known history of the area said the tunnel was “the best outcome” in terms of reducing disruption to bioersity and heritage.Local TD Jennifer Whitmore who lives in Delgany said the community “has been very clear since the start of this process that they want the local, natural and cultural heritage of the area protected and this must be a key priority for the project”.The Glen of the Downs section of the N11M11 upgrade is part of a 22km upgrade of the N11M11 corridor stretching from the M50 to Coynes Cross in Ashford.The scheme traverses two local authority boundaries, Wicklow County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Wicklow County Council is the lead authority and appointed consultants Arup in 2018.However, as the area falls within the bounds of the Kildare National Roads Office, that office is responsible for the project management and delivery.

Photograph: RTÉScreenshotThe information is contained in a documentary about the Burren, Co Clare broadcast on Sunday. Photograph: RTÉScreenshotPrehistoric Irish people were dark skinned and had blue eyes, a new documentary claims.The hunter gather population that lived in Ireland 10,000 years ago do not have any of the pigmentation profiles associated with light skin.They inhabited the island for 4,000 years before being replaced by settled farmers.According to TCD geneticist Dr Lara Cassidy, techniques normally used in forensic criminal investigations have revealed surprising details about prehistoric Irish people.Scientists have been developing a genetic database of ancient Irish genomes from all periods of pre-history to understand how the modern Irish gene pool came about.She said the hunter-gatherer Irish not only had dark skin, but also bright blue eyes – a combination rarely seen today.They operated mostly along the coast of the Burren gathering shellfish, and then moving inland to hunt wild boar and gather hazelnuts.The Burren’s unique geological landscape means it has preserved evidence of millennia of settlement in the area of west Clare.The hunter gathers were replaced by early farmers. The earliest evidence of farmers in Ireland is in the Burren. They arrived approximately 6,000 years ago in what was known as the Neolithic era.“We know now from ancient genomes that farming was accompanied by a whole group of people moving into the continent from the region now known as modern Turkey, ” she said.They brought cattle, sheep and goats, pottery and new housing structures. They have lighter skin than the hunter gather, but more sallow than today.“There could have been violence. This would have been quite a dramatic colonisation event,” Dr Cassidy added.However, it is more likely that they co-existed peacefully as the remains of one early farmer showed that he had hunter gatherer ancestry.Gene poolThe early farmers began by clearing the trees with polished stone axes to make for arable land. They built the dolmens which populate the area.In 4,000 years the last wave of early settlers came to Ireland. They were at the tail end of a large scale migration in the Steppe region of Russia into western Europe.“Only at that point do we see the establishment of the modern Irish gene pool as we know it today,” Dr Cassidy added.Environmental biologist Carl Wright said the Burren once featured high mountains with a thick forest covering. The mountains were replaced by glaciers during the Ice Age which removed a kilometre of rock off the top of this landscape.The early farmers relentlessly cleared the forests until there was hardly any of the original forest left.“They overgrazed the Burren during the climatic downturn of 3,000 years ago – this led to an environmental disaster on a colossal scale, because over a very short space of time we have massive soil erosion which pretty much left us with the landscape that we have at the end of the last ice age. Literally just bare rock, the soil was washed away,” he said.The Burren:\u0026nbspHeart of Stone is now available to view on the RTÉ Player #HeartOfStoneStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"foster denies unionists boycotting meetings with republic s ministers","story":"Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster described as ‘misplaced’ and “’quite mischievous’ claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers. File photograph: Mark MarlowPA Wire Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster has denied unionists are boycotting meetings with the Irish Government as part of a plan to overthrow the Northern Ireland protocol.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader described as “misplaced” and “quite mischievous” claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers.On Friday, a meeting involving Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan and his counterpart in the North Nichola Mallon had to be abandoned because, as Ms Foster said, “it did not suit” the nominated unionist Minister to attend.It was the second such meeting in two weeks “to be obstructed in this way”, according to Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long. But speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday, Ms Foster rejected allegations “that we are refusing, in inverted commas, to attend meetings between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of the Republic of Ireland”.“That is simply not the case,” she said.But she warned NorthSouth relations “will of course be affected by the fact that the protocol is in place, because of its damage to eastwest relationships.”“We need to sort it out and we need to get rid of the protocol so we can continue to have relationships with our nearest neighbour in the appropriate way in the future,” she added.Unionists have united for a five-point plan to get rid of the protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement which puts a de facto trade barrier for goods in the Irish Sea to prevent any need for a hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland.Ms Mallon has accused the DUP of engaging in a “deliberate act” of obstructing North-South co-operation as part of its plan, adding that it was undermining the Belfast Agreement.Responding to remarks by the European Commission vice-president in charge of Brexit, Maros Sefcovic, that the protocol was the only way to protect the peace deal, Ms Foster said Mr Sefcovic “either wilfully misunderstands the Belfast Agreement or is misrepresenting it for his own ends”.“There is a need for those in Europe, in London, in Dublin as well, to listen to the voices of those of us who will not have the protocol, because it is damaging the economy of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But more than that, it is damaging our citizenship here in Northern Ireland as equal citizens of the United Kingdom, because we cannot partake in the internal market of the United Kingdom.”Asked if the North’s DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds would attend a scheduled NSMC meeting due to take place this week, Ms Foster would only say her party was “fully aware” of its legal ministerial responsibilities.Ms Mallon had gone ahead with last Friday’s meeting “despite the fact she had been told it did not suit the nominated person who would accompany with her” under the cross-community rules of the meetings, she said.Ms Foster said the agenda and papers for the meeting had also not been agreed by her office.NSMC councils have to “proceed by agreement” and “I very much hope agreement and consensus will be sought by those Ministers setting up NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings in future”, she added.The DUP leader met businesses in the North on Friday to discuss the costs they are suffering as a result of Brexit.“I was, I have to say, alarmed at the extra costs that those businesses are having to incur,” she told the Assembly.“Some of course are passing them on to consumers and to clients, which is very worrying as well.”Ms Foster said there has been a “reduction in choice and an increase in costs”, which she blamed on the protocol “being implemented in the fashion that it has been”.“I mean, the amount of damage being done to our businesses is quite incalculable,” the First Minister added.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald warned any refusal by unionists to participate in NSMC meetings “raises very serious questions, not just for the DUP, but for all of us”.“You can’t cherry pick the Good Friday Agreement,” she said, after meetings with other Stormont Executive parties in Belfast.“Political progress, stability and inclusion relies on all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement working and working well.“The North-South piece is absolutely essential and that means that unionists of all hues have to participate in those meetings.

Zoos, wildlife parks and heritage sites will also be allowed to reopen.Mr Harris was asked at an event on Monday what the plan was for the reopening of outdoor hospitality given comments from Taoiseach Micheál Martin that hotels and guesthouses could reopen in June.“I do think the evidence around outdoor activities, and how they can be done safely, perhaps gives hope that we can do a little bit more in the outdoor space. I think there might be the potential to do a bit more in May.“For example at the moment you can meet up outdoor with one household, is there a possibility you can do more in relation to that? Things like outdoor dining and the likes, I am not in a position to give a definitive view on, but I think we need to start answering those questions next week.”The Cabinet will meet next week to outline what can open in May, June and July subject to public health advice.“When the Cabinet meets next week to talk about restrictions, it needs to provide a roadmap that goes beyond May. We need to try and provide people with as much certainty. So I think we should be able to provide detail on what May, June and July will look like,” Mr Harris said.“If this week continues the way the last couple have, we will be able to meet as a Cabinet next week in a better position on Covid than we have been in many, many months. We are on the cusp of really getting ahead of this virus for the first time in a long time.”Mr Harris also said the Cabinet stands “full square” behind the Minister for Health after reports that his Cabinet colleagues felt blindsided after Stephen Donnelly said over the weekend that younger groups could be vaccinated ahead of time. Mr Donnelly then said the data did not support such a move.“I think it is very important that the Government speaks extremely clearly on this matter and I hope we are today,” Mr Harris said. “The vaccine programme and the order remains unchanged. What people across our country want is certainty. I think what we now need to do is stick with the system we have, get on with the job, get the jabs in the arms as quick as possible.”Mr Harris was speaking at the launch of a five-year action plan for apprenticeships which aims to see 10,000 new apprentice registrations every year by 2025.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry not sorry mcdonald s mountbatten  mark a change of tone","story":"Speaking in an interview on  Britain’s Times Radio, the day after the funeral of Prince Philip, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was “sorry” the IRA killed Lord Mountbatten in 1979. Video: Times RadioMary Lou McDonald’s comments were not quite the full-throated apology for IRA actions that many headlines would suggest. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMary Lou McDonald’s weekend comments on being “sorry” about the death of Lord Mountbatten were not quite the full-throated apology for IRA actions that many headlines, especially in the British press, would suggest. But they did represent a new tone from the Sinn Féin leader.When asked on Times Radio if she would apologise to Prince Charles for the death of his uncle along with two boys and a woman when his boat was blown up off Co Sligo in 1979, McDonald said: “The army and armed forces associated with Prince Charles carried out many, many violent actions on our island. I can say of course I am sorry that happened. Of course, that is heartbreaking.”You can read this either way. Sorry for the killing of Mountbatten, or sorry the whole conflict happened. The ambiguity is hardly unintentional.Asked on Monday if McDonald was apologising, Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said it was “an admission of regret and an acknowledgement of the suffering for the family involved”.Pressed as to whether McDonald intended to go further than Sinn Féin has previously on the subject, Ó Broin replied, “I don’t know”.McDonald is a canny enough media operator to have foreseen headlines about the “apology”. That – and the fact she chose the weekend of Prince Philip’s funeral to make the statement – suggests a deliberate attempt to move the dial.Regret and sorrowWhile expressing regret and sorrow for the suffering caused by the conflict in general, Sinn Féin has never disavowed the IRA or its actions and is unlikely to start now. This is part tactical, part theology. Once you start to address inidual incidents, where do you stop?But on a deeper level, it remains a fundamental tenet of republican thinking that the IRA campaign – while admitting inidual mistakes and expressing regret for all deaths in the conflict – was morally and politically justified. That belief is ingrained in the party’s DNA.So McDonald is unlikely to rewrite that theology. But she does appear – and some party sources agree – to be trying to alter the tone, at least a bit.Her comments on Mountbatten followed a tweet expressing sympathy with Queen Elizabeth on the death of her husband. Since McDonald does not expect the queen to be closely following her Twitter account, it is fair to assume the intended audience included those referenced in the second part of the post – “those of a British identity on our island, for whom his death will be felt as a great loss”.It is unlikely, too, that she just dashed off a tweet when she heard the news. This is not the sort of thing that Sinn Féin does on the spur of the moment.Against the background of a ided Northern Executive and increasing loyalist alienation, McDonald seems to be making conciliatory noises. It is an interesting departure."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: The European Super League is protectionism at its worstComment: Let\u0026#39s be driven by data rather than dates - and open up fasterCoronavirus latest news: Border officials detect at least 100 fake Covid certificates every dayJustin Welby: Church must not use gagging orders to silence abuse victims Hillsborough disaster: Police officers tried to \u0026#39minimise blame by altering witness statements\u0026#39, court told\u0026#39No-yez, no-yez, no-yez\u0026#39: Britain\u0026#39s town criers resume competition in silenceIdriss Déby, president of Chad for more than 30 years who died during fighting with rebel forces – obituaryChad\u0026#39s President Idriss Deby Itno killed in \u0026#39clashes with rebel fighters\u0026#39Covid lockdown roadmap: key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will change on May 17Comment: Only a civil servant could think the way to defeat the SNP is to surrender to them on every frontComment: Why do city people need woke National Trust directives when they could just go for a walk?University engineer used tiny hidden shoe camera to upskirt more than 250 women Australia scraps \u0026#39cringeworthy and confusing\u0026#39 sexual consent videos featuring sharks and milkshakesComment: The European Super League has shown the hypocrisy of the football eliteComment: Keir Starmer\u0026#39s run-in with the pub landlord shows just how much Labour has the reverse Midas touchExclusive: Johnny Mercer on brink of resigning over \u0026#39betrayal\u0026#39 of Troubles troopsGeorge Floyd: Jurors to resume deliberations in Derek Chauvin murder trialHow the charges against Derek Chauvin hold the key to unrest on the streets of AmericaArmin Laschet: Safe choice to replace Angela Merkel, but can he lead the party to victory?St George\u0026#39s Day 2021: how the dragon-slayer became the patron saint of EnglandBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"annalena baerbock named green candidate succeed angela merkel","story":"Angela Merkel’s CDU on Monday night named Armin Laschet as the man who will lead the party in September’s elections to replace the veteran Chancellor of Germany. Mr Laschet tried to draw a line under the days of vicious infighting with his rival Markus Söder, whose supporters threatened to prolong the impasse by demanding a vote by MPs on the decision. The high profile feud between the CDU leader Mr Laschet and Mr Söder, leader of its Bavarian sister party, has damaged the Christian Democrats in the polls and handed the Greens an early advantage in the campaign.The German Green party named Annalena Baerbock as its candidate on Monday. Ms Baerbock beat Robert Habeck, a 51-year-old former academic and her fellow party leader, to the candidacy. The two leaders honoured a pledge to resolve the issue amicably behind closed doors and announced their decision together.The contrast with the high profile feud gripping Mrs Merkel’s own party could not be more striking.Mr Laschet and Mr Söder put themselves forward as chancellor candidate and both refused to back down.After failing to meet a Friday deadline to resolve the impasse, both men travelled to Berlin for late night talks on Sunday that ended without agreement.Mr Söder appeared to open the way to a compromise on Monday when he said he would abide by the CDU board’s decision.“Everyone wants to decide as quickly as possible, as amicably as possible,” Mr Laschet said ahead of Monday\u0027s meeting.He called the party board together to resolve the issue after late night talks with Mr Söder broke down without an agreement in the early hours of Monday morning.Mr Söder declined an invitation to attend the meeting, saying his party had made its decision and it was now up to its “big sister party”.But his supporters promptly called a meeting of the two parties’ MPs on Tuesday to review the board’s decision.  “The board cannot force their decision past the MPs,” one told Bild newspaper.Ms Baerbock, the only woman candidate named so far, may yet beat both the men vying for the CDU candidacy to the chancellorship.The 40-year-old career politician and former competitive trampolinist has a genuine chance of becoming Germany’s first ever Green chancellor.“Germany needs a fresh start,” Ms Baerbock told a press conference. “With the Greens there will be a different style of politics, working together and not against each other.”The Greens are currently second in the polls on 23 per cent, behind the CDU on 27 per cent, but Mrs Merkel’s party is haemorrhaging support and has lost 10 points since January.As one seasoned German observer put it: “It is the Greens who now look like the natural party of power”.The Greens are currently second in the polls on 23 per cent, behind the CDU on 27 per cent, but Mrs Merkel’s party is haemorrhaging support and has lost 10 points since January.A lot can happen between now and September but as things stand the Greens have a real chance of leading a rival coalition to power.Ms Baerbock was long seen as behind the more charismatic Mr Habeck to secure the party candidacy.But a series of gaffes by Mr Habeck saw Ms Baerbock surge ahead of him in the opinion polls, particularly among Green voters, who favour her by 52 per cent to 26 per cent.She also received an undoubted boost from the Greens’ desire to be the only major party to put forward a woman as candidate for chancellor this year.Two men in their 50s are vying to lead the CDU campaign, while a third, Olaf Scholz, has already been named as the candidate for the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD).“If we have two equally good candidates, it cannot be that the Greens prefer the man,”  a party insider told Bild.With two young children, Ms Baerbock is also seen by the party as a standard bearer for working mothers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"100ft phone masts could built national parks beauty spots","story":"One hundred foot phone masts are to be given the green light across Britain as the Government unveils plans to relax restrictions in national parks and beauty spots.Mobile companies will be allowed to erect new masts of up to 30 metres (98ft) in most areas and up to 25 metres (82ft) high in protected areas under new rules to boost 4G and 5G mobile signal coverage in rural communities.The new limits are five metres (16ft) taller than can currently be built but shorter than the 50 metres (164ft) wanted by mobile companies, which would have allowed them to erect masts the size of Nelson’s Column. Under the new rules, operators will also be allowed to put up smaller ‘monopole’ masts of up to 15 metres (49ft) by only notifying local councils rather than applying for full planning permission.Writing exclusively for The , which can be read below, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the new taller structures would allow telecoms companies to extend mobile coverage by miles while needing to install fewer new masts.He said: “We’ve all been there: out on a long walk or holidaying in the countryside, you find yourself fruitlessly holding your phone in the air, trying to get a signal. For visitors, that’s merely an inconvenience. “But for the people trying to live, work and bring up a family in those areas, it has a negative effect on almost every part of their lives. If we truly want to level up the country, we cannot allow rural communities to become second class citizens in the digital economy.”Mr Dowden added: “We’ve struck a careful balance: we want to remove some unnecessary bureaucracy around planning that is preventing  rural communities from upgrading their mobile coverage, while making sure we protect our precious countryside.”The Government hopes cutting red tape for mobile providers will speed up the rollout of its £1billion Shared Rural Network initiative that will see companies start sharing masts to increase coverage.Only around two thirds of the UK currently has consistent mobile signal coverage, however, the proposals seek to increase that to 95 per cent by 2025.The agreement, signed last year, came after ministers initially threatened to impose a system of ‘national roaming’ on telecoms companies that would force them to share each other’s networks to improve nationwide coverage.But the plans were vociferously opposed by mobile operators who argued they would slow the rollout as they would be reluctant to invest in new infrastructure to expand rivals’ service.Under the current scheme, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone will spend £530million to share masts so users can get signal in areas their providers traditionally had a patchy network coverage.The Government has also pledged £500million to build new masts to improve signal in remote areas. On Tuesday, ministers revealed the final details of the new rules for extending phone masts as part of a short consultation ahead of a bill coming before Parliament.Under the proposals, telecoms companies will also be allowed to extend existing masts by up to 25 metre (82ft) in normal areas and 20 metres (65ft) in protected areas without council permission, and then by up to 30 metres and 25 metres overall with prior permission from local authorities.The new regime will also allow operators to erect building-based masts nearer to roads and motorways to improve signal for motorists.The proposals were welcomed by the Countryside Alliance, who said the “scandalous” lack of mobile coverage in rural areas puts lives at risk and hinders businesses.Sue Lee, head of policy at the Countryside Alliance, said: “The Shared Rural Network will connect many rural communities that are suffering due to poor connectivity and this is to be welcomed but for some communities there will be a trade off where masts need to be extended to provide coverage. “However, in areas of outstanding natural beauty or national parks, we would expect mobile operators to work with those communities to site masts as sensitively as possible to limit the impact on the countryside.”By Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and SportThe Government is on a mission to drag rural communities out of the digital dark ages.Right now, too many villages and towns are blighted with patchy and poor coverage, or sometimes no mobile phone signal at all.We’ve all been there: out on a long walk or holidaying in the countryside, you find yourself fruitlessly holding your phone in the air, trying to get a signal.For visitors, that’s merely an inconvenience. But for the people trying to live, work and bring up a family in those areas, it has a negative effect on almost every part of their lives. If we truly want to level up the country, we cannot allow rural communities to become second class citizens in the digital economy.So last year the Government struck a world-leading, £1billion deal with the UK’s major mobile firms to create a shared network of new and existing phone masts, so that we can extend geographic 4G coverage to 95 per cent of the UK. Day by day, that rural network is eliminating \u0027notspots\u0027 in shires and villages across the country.But we want to put even more power in the hands of rural communities to get the connectivity they are crying out for.The  has been a dedicated campaigner on this issue, making sure these areas aren’t left behind in the digital revolution.This week, we are taking some small but practical steps to boost that mission, making it easier for mobile firms such as Vodafone, O2, EE and Three to build, share and upgrade telecoms infrastructure across the entire country.We’ve struck a careful balance: we want to remove some unnecessary bureaucracy around planning that is preventing  rural communities from upgrading their mobile coverage, while making sure we protect our precious countryside.Some of these changes are minor, but they could make a huge difference.Our reforms will allow phone masts to be an extra five metres higher, for example, and up to two metres wider in certain circumstances, so that they can hold more equipment and so mobile operators can share them. The addition of just a few metres could boost the range of a mast by miles – transforming the connectivity of a rural community. This means we’ll get the maximum use out of the masts we already have. In turn, most importantly, it means fewer masts in the long run – helping to protect the countryside we love. Above all, we want to make sure local communities have control over their own destinies. Our proposals give them the power to direct development in their areas as they see fit.Changes will be put to the local planning authority, and there will be strong safeguards in place to protect sensitive places such as national parks, conservation of heritage sites, and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.New masts will still be subject to certain conditions and limitations, and we’ll be publishing a new code of practice on mobile infrastructure so that planners and operators have clear, up-to-date advice on how to locate and design masts in consultation with local communities. We’ve already heeded The ’s call for action with our £1billion investment in the shared rural network. Now it’s time to bust some of the barriers that are preventing people across the UK from accessing life-changing mobile coverage.With a few practical changes, we can transform the fate of a rural village or town – propelling them straight from the digital dark ages into cutting-edge, 21st century connectivity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"do city people need woke national trust directives could just","story":"Six years ago, visiting the ladies pond on Hampstead Heath even at peak summer was a relaxed affair – no queues, no entry fees, just an assortment of blissfully un-self-conscious, hot people keen on cooling off in some rather murky chilly water. In the intervening years, films, books and countless articles extolling the virtues of ‘wild’ swimming, and the glories of the Hampstead ponds in particular, have ensured not only a multi-hour queue on hot days, but paid-for wristbands and season memberships as well. In winter, when it is really quite horrible at the Ladies Pond, there is still steady traffic as the gospel of the benefits of cold water swimming in nature has taken hold.And so I find myself agreeing with celebrity woodsman Ray Mears, whose new book We Are Nature advises people to reconnect with nature – and drop all the pretentiousness.  In an interview with Radio Times about the book, Mears took aim at the very term ‘wild swimming’ as well as the much-vaunted practice of ‘forest bathing’, which has been heavily promoted by the National Trust in recent years and entails ‘the practice of slowing down and immersing yourself in the forest atmosphere”. Going for a walk in a wood, in other words. Mears thinks all the trendy fuss – the fetishisation of the outdoors, if you will – is actually an impediment to simply getting out and enjoying nature. That, he says, should be a simple affair: pull on your shoes and go out for a walk. ‘I feel we need to rewild people,’ he told Radio Times. ‘We live in this very strange world now, of ‘forest bathing’ and ‘wild swimming’ - but for me it’s just walking, being outdoors. And we’ve forgotten how to do that.”Certainly Londoners have. As a no-fuss year-round outdoor swimmer myself – I have no special equipment, booties, gloves, Dry Robe coat just my tattered Speedo – I find the chatter at the pond these days tiresome. It’s all about how wonderful the experience is, how daring, how extreme, how good for one. Everyone has lots of accoutrements. I wish they would just swim and quietly contemplate their surroundings, rather than publicise the post-swim tingles or the tea-filled thermos they’d brought, going on as if they deserved an award for avant-garde nature-communion.Having grown up in a small town near the sea in a fairly rural part of Massachusetts, nature was a part of daily life – especially the sea – but not something subject to trends and fads disseminated from woke institutions like the National Trust. In rural parts of the UK people no doubt spend far more time outdoors too but do so without the guiding grace of a  article on how best to experience nature. When I spent a few days climbing dales in Yorkshire last summer, I was fairly sure that the farmers and other ramblers we saw weren’t in pursuit of the perfect spot for forest bathing – they seemed satisfied with a brisk trudge through hill and dale, fresh air on their face.The fact is, one doesn’t need much so long as one is outside: just smelling the air and the flowers, listening to the birds, and enjoying the mud or the grass or the roots is what it’s all about. Mears is right: the modern predilection for turning everything to do with exercise and nature into a fetish has been counterproductive. It has made the whole thing horribly competitive, as anyone who has tried braving the crowds at one of the newly lauded wild beauty spots can attest. Lidos are packed out. River banks are stuffed, and there’s no parking to be had near some of the most bucolic lakes in the land on a warm day.We need to take a breather, and simplify. There was a time when a good solid walk was good enough, and it would be better, and healthier for us all, if we could return to it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ira says sorry apology","story":"You may have read that the Sinn Fein leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has “apologised” for the IRA’s murder of Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Mountbatten, in 1979. Prince Charles has described Lord Mountbatten as “the grandfather I never had”.What Ms McDonald actually said was: “The army and the armed forces associated with Prince Charles carried out many, many violent actions on our island. And I can say, of course, I am sorry that that happened.” The “that” Ms McDonald was referring to was the murder of Mountbatten – and of those with him, including two teenage boys, aboard the boat which the IRA blew up – but the context in which she sets it transfers blame to British forces.She went on: “Of course, that is heartbreaking. My job, and I think that Prince Charles … would absolutely appreciate this…is to lead from the front, now, in these times.” It is “all our jobs to ensure that no other child, no other family…face the kind of trauma and heartbreak that was all too common on all sides ... I have an absolute commitment and responsibility to make sure that no family faces that again. And I am happy to reiterate that on the weekend that your queen buried her beloved husband.”Where is the apology?Some will think it in terrible taste for Ms McDonald to speak sweetly of the Queen burying her “beloved husband”. She well knows that the organisation her party has always supported was responsible, in a grimly different sense, for burying his uncle.The media in the Republic of Ireland are sharper on all this than ours are. The  asked Sinn Féin to clarify whether Ms McDonald was making an “apology” over the IRA attack. “Several hours after seeking clarification,” it reported, “there was no response from the party.”“Government to guarantee 95 per cent mortgages” is the headline the Conservatives want, and are getting. But does the measure, which came into effect yesterday, have any wider benefit?It will help some of those young people who take it up, in that they will have the pleasure – earlier than they otherwise would – of possessing a set of keys and coming home in the evening to a house which they feel (erroneously) is theirs. When that house sought costs ten times the annual income of the seeker, as is often the case today, they may think better of a government which seems to assist them getting it. If the market is up when their turn comes to sell, that too will please them.But the guarantee does not solve the problem of housing which is hard for young people to buy. In fact, it compounds it, because it subsidises people to pay more, thus making life all too easy for the big builders who ration the supply in order to keep the prices up. It also encourages young buyers to acquire too much debt, which will land them in negative equity if values fall, or with unaffordable repayments if interest rates rise.Sensing the problem, big banks are being cautious. Several say they will not lend for new-build housing under the scheme because its value is volatile.And so Britain’s housing shortage continues, with price rises made even worse by the current stamp-duty holiday. During Covid, millions have learnt to use their house as a place of work: some of them now look for houses more suitable for that role in future. They won’t get what they want so long as the same Tory Government which is standing partially behind 95 per cent mortgages refuses to free up the supply of actual bricks and mortar.Last Friday, Ampleforth College, won a reprieve. The famous Yorkshire Catholic independent school had been under a “restriction order” from the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, until it fully complied with demands from the inspectorate, Ofsted, to improve its safeguarding procedures. This meant it could admit no new pupils until compliance had been secured.The problem was that, if Ofsted’s demands had been followed to the letter, Ampleforth would have run out of time. Parents of independent-school pupils need to know that their children’s school will remain open in the next academic year. If they think it won’t, they have to secure places elsewhere. Since the school was forbidden to admit new pupils, it would run out of money and therefore close. Mr Williamson’s rescue came almost beyond one minute to midnight. He decided there was enough prospective progress for the restriction order to be lifted. The school will be inspected again in the autumn.You can see why Ofsted wanted to be sure that everything was right. But it is literally impossible for schools if they are told to make improvements and then not allowed the time needed to bed those improvements in. The word “safeguarding” has a hollow ring if every single child at a good school has his or her education sacrificed by government edict in the name of upholding safeguarding principles.Now Ampleforth lives to teach another day. With a bit of luck, two good things will emerge. The first is that the school, chastened by past failures, gets safeguarding right. That is already happening fast. The other is that Ofsted acquires a better understanding of the reality of life in schools and, in particular, stops treating independent faith schools with such hostility.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmers run in pub landlord shows just much labour has","story":"One of the key tests of political leaders is whether voters could imagine themselves enjoying having a drink with them down at the pub.Whatever you think about Boris Johnson, there is little doubt that he passes this test with flying colours. Yesterday he posted on social media a photograph of himself having a laugh and a joke with a couple of female drinkers in the garden of one hostelry.The two ladies have glasses of white wine, while the PM is holding a pint of beer, thus satisfying the stipulations of Al Murray’s The Pub Landlord about gender-appropriate beverages. And here is the thing: the women are wreathed in smiles as Boris entertains them with his latest banter.This man who is primarily responsible for the parlous state of the hospitality industry, having by edict shut down pubs for months, is nonetheless wholly at ease in the surroundings.That’s not how it turned out in Bath at around the same time, when Keir Starmer pitched up at The Raven public house, no doubt hoping to conduct a photo-call of himself impersonating a regular guy downing a pint. The Labour leader even turned up suited but tie-less, because that’s what regular guys do when they are kicking back, right? Wrong.Everything, in fact, went wrong. To say Starmer was like a fish out of water would be to do an injustice to the levels of elegance achieved by gasping salmon on riverbanks. The whole, cringeworthy episode culminated in landlord Rod Humphris bellowing that time-honoured phrase of British publicans to undesirables: “Get out of my pub!”Head-bowed and masked as per regulation, Starmer complied though his security man got into an unfortunate tussle with Mr Humphris, who claimed to be a lifelong Labour voter.Starmer’s sin, in the eyes of Mr Humphris, was failing to oppose the Government’s lockdown measures which he pointed out had done something very Anglo-Saxon to the economy. Starmer’s reply was to mention the efforts of frontline workers before adding: “I really don’t need lectures from you about this pandemic.”The Labour leader tried to retrieve the situation by scoring some banter points of his own when he later tweeted his official response to the incident and it turned out to be an internet link to a voter registration form. But he was even criticised for that, with it being interpreted as yet more high-handedness from a cosseted member of the London political class.How monstrously unfair these events were on Starmer. That he should end up carrying the can for the policies of Boris Johnson – in effect becoming the PM’s whipping boy – is profoundly illogical. After all, the Tories are in government with a landslide majority. It is the Tories who have devised public policy towards coronavirus. True, Starmer backed the lockdown measures but according to the opinion polls so did most of the public.As Covid deaths tumble many of those winter enthusiasts for restrictions will no doubt choose to forget their willing compliance, grant Johnson a free pass for doing what he felt compelled to on expert advice and continue to regard Starmer as the “Mr Lockdown” of the piece.Should there be widespread sympathy for Starmer that won’t help him either because it will leave him looking like a loser and most of us don’t vote for losers. The whole persona of a party leader is meant to be about winning.Some Labour veterans believe the moment that settled Tony Blair’s assent to Downing Street came at the 1995 party conference when he played head tennis with Kevin Keegan and held his end up well in front of the cameras. Equally there is a school of thought that says Neil Kinnock was doomed from the moment he was filmed falling over on the beach at Brighton in 1983.Sir Keir’s visit to The Raven has much more in common with that episode than with Blair’s winning display, accentuating a public impression of him as an unsympathetic and colourless technocrat. Should Labour go on to lose the crucial parliamentary by-election in working class Hartlepool early next month, then Starmer failing the pub test may be deemed highly symbolic.It’s not fair. Life isn’t fair. But Keir Starmer looks an awful lot like a loser to me.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass fossil site may prove tyrannosaurs lived hunted packs like","story":"Ferocious tyrannosaur dinosaurs may not have been solitary predators as long envisioned, but more like social carnivores such as wolves, new research unveiled Monday found.Paleontologists developed the theory while studying a mass tyrannosaur death site found seven years ago in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, one of two monuments that the Biden administration is considering restoring to their full size after former President Donald Trump shrunk them.Using geochemical analysis of the bones and rock, a team of researchers with the University of Arkansas determined that the dinosaurs died and were buried in the same place and were not the result of fossils washing in from multiple areas.The new Utah site is the third mass tyrannosaur grave site that\u0027s been discovered in North America - bolstering a theory first developed 20 years ago that they lived in packs. However, more research needs to be done to make that argument, said Kristi Curry Rogers, a biology professor at Macalester College who wasn\u0027t involved in the research but reviewed the finding on Monday.It is a little tougher to be so sure that these data mean that these tyrannosaurs lived together in the good times, Rogers said. It\u0027s possible that these animals may have lived in the same vicinity as one another without travelling together in a social group, and just came together around dwindling resources as times got tougher.In 2014, Bureau of Land Management paleontologist Alan Titus discovered the site, which was later named the Rainbows and Unicorns quarry because of the vast array of fossils contained inside. Excavation has been ongoing since the site\u0027s discovery because of the size of the area and volume of bones.I consider this a once-in-a-lifetime discovery for myself, Titus told reporters during a virtual news conference. I probably won\u0027t find another site this exciting and scientifically significant during my career.The social tyrannosaurs theory began over 20 years ago when more than a dozen tyrannosaurs were found at a site in Alberta, Canada. Another mass death site in Montana again raised the possibility of social tyrannosaurs. Many scientists questioned the theory, arguing that the dinosaurs didn\u0027t have the brainpower to engage in sophisticated social interaction, Titus said.Going that next step to understand behaviour and how animals behave requires really amazing evidence, Joseph Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature \u0026amp Science, said at the news conference. I think that this site, the spectacular collection of tyrannosaurs but also the other assembled pieces of evidence ... pushes us to the point where we can show some evidence for behaviour.In addition to the tyrannosaurs, researchers have also found seven species of turtles, multiple fish and ray species, two other kinds of dinosaurs and a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile Deinosuchus alligator. These other animals do not appear to have all died together.Paleontology groups have been among those pushing the federal government to restore the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante to their original sizes to protect the region\u0027s rich paleontological and archaeological record.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited southern Utah earlier this month as she prepared to submit recommendations on whether to reverse Trump\u0027s decision to downsize the monuments. Titus said he showed Haaland some of the fossils at his lab during her visit and said she appreciated getting to see the material.The (Bureau of Land Management) is protecting these fossils as national treasures. Titus said. They\u0027re part of the story of how North America came to be and how ultimately we came to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"university engineer used tiny hidden shoe camera upskirt 250","story":"A university engineer who fitted a tiny camera inside a pair of shoes in order to film up women\u0027s skirts has admitted targeting more than 250 victims during a two month spree.Richard Whyley, 32, a father of two, used a hidden GoPro camera to record almost 6,500 upskirt images during shopping trips in Worcestershire.He also secretly filmed women getting undressed in their own homes as well as one couple having sex.But he was finally caught when a 16-year-old girl heard a camera click from his shoe while travelling on an escalator in August 2019.Whyley, who is thought to be one of the country\u0027s most prolific upskirt offenders, admitted voyeurism, and two charges of recording an image under clothing and operating equipment without consent, when he appeared at Worcester Crown Court.But he was spared jail after the judge opted to give him a three-year community order and placed him on the sex offenders\u0027 register for five years instead.The court heard how Whyley\u0027s offending ned the period between June 26 and August 15, 2019.He was caught when a teenage girl, who was out on a shopping trip with her 10-year-old cousin, raised the alarm after hearing a camera click coming from his foot.Whyley was traced using CCTV which tracked him to a building owned by the University of Worcester, where he was employed.With the help of university staff Whyley was identified and arrested while working testing fire alarms.A search of his company vehicle revealed two pairs of shoes with holes cut in the toes and an SD card with 94 images and videos recorded through windows of peoples homes.He took over 6,400 images of women, including of their underwear, buttocks and genitals. Police identified 250 separate female victims.The 16-year-old girl who raised the alarm was in court to see Whyley sentenced and she read a victim impact statement in which she described how the incident had affected her.She said: When this happened I had only just turned 16 and had gone shopping that day - it was the first time I had ever taken my little cousin off like that by myself.Since then, I have felt incapable of taking her out again and haven\u0027t felt I could protect her.I won\u0027t even answer the door if I\u0027m alone and things that I could do before I can\u0027t now.I have become so conscious of what I wear when I\u0027m out and in the town and there\u0027s other people around.I feel incredibly wary of middle-aged men that I can\u0027t trust and am constantly looking over my shoulder to keep myself a safe distance from other people.This has impacted on every aspect of my life and I\u0027m now constantly anxious and worried about something happening...I\u0027m going to have to live with this for the rest of my life.Sentencing Whyley, Judge Martin Jackson said: It seems to me this was something done for sexual gratification and you have accepted that by pleading guilty to the charges.There was a significant degree of planning, in particular the use of the GoPro camera and adaptation of footwear enabling you to place it inside the footwear so it could be used.Nicholas Wragg, defending, said the images had never uploaded to the internet on any occasion.Whyley was ordered to pay his victim £750 compensation and made subject of a five year sexual harm prevention order.He was also ordered to abide by an electronic curfew tag between the hours of 9pm to 6am for four months, pay £340 in court costs and undertake 40 rehabilitation requirement days and an accredited sex offender program.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"7 ways uk try block","story":"News ways UK may try to block Super League as government vows it must be stoppedTory ministers have vowed to do everything in their power to stop the Big Six football clubs breaking away.

Boris Johnson today said the ludicrous plans involving the Big Six football clubs should be shown a straight red - and said a bomb of new laws should be dropped now. The Prime Minister told fans: We are going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this doesn’t go ahead in the way that it’s currently being proposed. Ministers set up a fan-led review yesterday - almost  months after pledging it in their manesto - and Boris Johnson today held a round table with the FA, Premier League and football fan groups. The Prime Minister confirmed the government will not stand by while a small handful of owners create a closed shop, No said. He was clear that no action is off the table and the government is exploring every possibility, including legislative options, to ensure these proposals are stopped. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said today: This is a super league that must be stopped because itaposs just simply not fair, itaposs not right. Critics say the Super League will remove the excitement of competition by cementing the Big Six clubsapos place at the top. And it will decapitate the football pyramid which ensures money flows down to lower-league and grassroots clubs. But football clubs are private companies and we live in a democracy. So what could the government actually do in a bid to stop the plans  Here are seven of the most prominent options being thrown about.Pressure in the UK and internationallyMinisters have made clear they hope football bodies can sort out the crisis themselves - with political support from government. That is why Boris Johnson is holding a round table and why ministers are holding urgent talks.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs: “I think the best place to start is speaking to the president of UEFA and the leadership of the Premier League and the FA. “I hope that their actions can stop the proposal in its tracks, and I think we will see some very robust action from them.” Ministers also hope to apply international pressure by linking up with Spanish and Italian counterparts. No said: We are keen to speak to everyone involved in this, from other countries to the Premier League and others. Butthis political pressure doesn’t work, ministers are threatening to use “legislation” or more powerful measures - more below.  An estimated £million a year is spent policing matches in England and Wales, with most not recouped from clubs. Mr Dowden confirmed the government is looking at whether to withdraw this kind of support. He told MPs: “We are looking at what the Government do to facilitate matches and those clubs, and asking whether we should continue to provide that support. “Because it does not strike me that the Government should be providing that support in the face of this proposal.”German model where fans own at least % of the clubThe ‘German model’ in which fans own at least % of shares and voting rights in their club is being examined “very closely” by ministers. Mr Dowden confirmed it will form part of the fan-led review of football governance launched on Monday. And he said the fact German clubs were not part of the Super League “rather makes the case” for the German model.  Competition lawMr Dowden confirmed he was looking at competition law as one thing that could change or be enforced in this situation. He told MPs: “We have not ruled out legislative measures,those are required, but the first line of action needs to be with the football leagues themselves.”The Competition and Markets Authority is carefully considering the European Super League after Labour formally called for an investigation.A CMA spokeswoman said: The proposals for a European football super league have attracted high levels of public interest. It is a complex area and we will be carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals.Windfall taxesMr Dowden refused to rule out a “windfall tax” on clubs when questioned in the House of Commons. He replied: “We are looking at all those options and at competition law.”The Times reports Chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking at plans for a possible tax.This could apply either directly to the clubs taking part, or to any player transfers they make, according to reports.

Mr Corbyn made the remarks after a video emerged of him  talking about “Zionists” who “don’t understand English irony”. Defending himself against claims of anti-Semitism, the then-Labour leader said he was referring to two people who had been “very, very abusive” to the Palestinian ambassador at a meeting in Parliament. “The two people I referred to had been incredibly disruptive, indeed the police wanted to throw them out of the meeting. I didn’t,” Mr Corbyn told the BBC in . But that triggered legal action from Mr Millett - who said while he wasn’t named, he was identiable as one of the two people.  In order to bring a libel case, Mr Millett had to establish that Mr Corbyn’s words were a “statement of fact” rather than opinion referring to Mr Millett directly and capable of defaming his character. Last year, High Court judge Mr Justice Saini cleared the way for that trial by ruling in favour of Mr Millett on all three points. The judge said the “ordinary meaning” of Mr Corbyn’s remarks was that they were a statement of fact referring to Mr Millett - claiming he was “so disruptive” police had wanted to remove him. Mr Corbyn tried to overturn two of the judge’s three findings at the Court of Appeal, but lost his attempt to do so today. His lawyers had claimed the original judge was wrong to find his statement was entirely factual”, instead claiming it was the exercise of the right to freedom of expression by a senior politician”.

Scots will also be able to travel south of the Border to visit friends and family in England and Wales. Galleries, museums and libraries will also be able to reopen from April . Speaking at her now weekly covid briefing in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said the continuing drop in covid cases across the country had made the reopening possible. But she urged Scots to remain cautious and continue to follow the remaining restrictions - including a ban on indoor gatherings at home - for now. As we reopen, some people may think the risk has receded so we can throw caution to the wind, she said. The opposite is true.

But as we go out about a bit more - levels of the virus might be lower - but youaposre more likely to come into contact with it as youaposre seeing more people. So it becomes even more important to do all things weaposve been asking you to do all year - whether thataposs wearing face coverings or keeping a safe physical distance.

Charlie Smithaposs grandfather Alan, , built the fort from sticks and branches in June , for the toddler and his sister Molly, one. The little ones and their pals visit the mini hide out on the side of Whitmoor Common during their daily walks. But the family, from Guildford, Surrey, were contacted by the council and asked to remove the handmade decorations from inside because they werenapost biodegradable. And when the family didnapost comply, council workers cleared out the den - and then left a note outside saying even painted wooden decorations had to go too, they claim. It was followed by an email from Surrey County Council officers demanding they must remove the wooden plank sign above the entrance which said Charlieaposs Den.Have you had a similar issue with your local council  Let us know at webnews@mirrorLand protection officers said it suggests a degree of ownership which may deter others from playing. Charlieaposs family blasted the petty council who have apparently now taken the sign and childrenapossapos decorations away. Charlieaposs aunt Stephanie Smith, , said: Itaposs awful for him, every time he goes up there you donapost know what to expect.  Heaposs done all these painted logs and theyaposve been taken down. Heaposs more confused of why, you canapost really explain to him, heaposs only three. If heaposs up there and he sees other kids he says come in here, come see my den.  The family put up decorations in the den for celebrations throughout the year, including Halloween, Christmas, Easter and Valentineaposs Day. But council members have contacted them directly asking for them to be removed, and twice eventually removed them themselves. Charlieaposs aunt Stephanie said: We put sweets in there for Halloween, and mum went up there every day to make sure nothing was left there. We live on the common, the last thing we want is there to be litter everywhere. Grandmother Tina Smith, , said We arranged a Halloween trail for kids to do during the school holidays and many children did this before the st. But then on the morning of the st I had a message saying a lady had removed the decorations.  When I messaged to ask why she said it was a danger to the wildle andshe had had enough bags she would have destroyed the den. Surrey County Council informed them afterwards that they were happy with the den, but everything inside had to be environmentally-friendly, she claims. The Smith family then decorated the tepee-like structure for Christmas and ensured every addition was biodegradable. Charlie and his little sister had painted some tree stumps to make their hideaway more festive.  But a couple of weeks later, a sign was put up outside the den again demanding the their work to be removed, they said. Tina said: All decorations were made out of wood and not dangerous at all. Referring to the sign suggesting ownership, she added: I have had hundreds of messages and people have posted photos of their children and animals at the den.The den even has its own Google Maps marker.Tina said: Itaposs just the fact that itaposs so petty - itaposs a den thataposs got decorations. Thereaposs a tree that gets decorated every year with baubles and little pretend presents and there was no complaints about that.

Philip Thomas, a professor of risk management at Bristol University, said there is little reason why the Governmentaposs June  aposfullapos lting of restrictions target date canapost be met. He described those who suggest the UK could see tens of thousands more deaths as measures are eased as pessimistic and full of bleak foreboding. It comes after modelling done by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned that a third wave of infections and deaths is highly likely earlier this month.Prof Thomas said this gloom narrative has been compounded by fears about the new iants, including the B.. type from India, which led PM Boris Johnson to abandon plans to travel there. I believe this negativity is overdone, he wrote in the Daily Mail.Have you had a vaccine yet  Let us know in the commentsThere is little convincing evidence to back the claim that, as lockdown is eased, Britain is about to be hit by a third wave, accompanied by a renewed surge in deaths. On the contrary, it is my view thatthere is indeed an increase in infections over the coming months, it will have little signicant impact and the death toll will remain extremely low.  That is because of the huge success of the vaccine programme, which will mean that by June, the overwhelming majority of the population is protected. Prof Thomas added the reality is we are beating the pandemic and immunity will grow as the year moves on, meaning there is no justication for restrictive measures to continue. The expertaposs optimism comes in part from a mathematical model called PCCF he created which uses data to project the virusaposs trajectory, and tested against measurements made by the Office for National Statistics .

Elasticated waistbands make trousers easy to put on, and ensure they are extra-comfortable too. Tom Purser, head of campaigns at the National Autistic Society, said: Parents often tell us how sensory sensitivities can mean that autistic children struggle with clothing, like an itchy label, a scratchy seam or an uncomfortable fabric. Finding clothing their children can wear can make shopping for clothes time consuming and stressful. Many parents have to scour specialist shops for everyday items that other families are able to buy easily. So, it makes a real dference when a major retailer takes this on.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA predator police constable has been dismissed for appalling gross misconduct after being found guilty of trying it on with four vulnerable domestic abuse victims. Married father-of-two PC Colin Noble, who had been a serving officer with West Midlands Police for  years, claimed he only called one woman fit in a ham-fisted attempt at boosting her confidence. But he also looked at her breasts, asking to see what you are working with, suggested she unbutton her shirt, and enquiredshe had any nudes. Unknown to the experienced officer, he was secretly recorded by that complainant, known as Miss X, because of her concerns about his behaviour. Audio of those conversations was played during a six-day disciplinary hearing at the forceaposs headquarters, which also heard evidence from the other complainants where he was alleged to have made a catalogue of completely inappropriate comments between  and . A three-member  found the case against the -year-old proven on Monday, stating they preferred the account of Miss X, and three other complainants, Miss A, B and C, over that of Noble. Giving findings of fact, the  concluded that Noble had turned up at Miss Aaposs house unannounced up to  times, telling her she was too pretty for her boyfriend. He also touched her neck, asking to see her tattoos, and whether he could see those on her thighs, and askedshe had ever slept with a black man. The complainant, giving evidence, said Nobleaposs remarks made her feel weird and sick - adding: Itaposs just not nice... you believe you can trust people but you canapost. Another complainant, Miss C, said she and Noble had developed a semi-relationship. The domestic abuse victim said the officer had asked her How can you be single wearing those boots  - referring to the thigh-high boots she had been wearing during a police interview.  Noble told her he could get into trouble for contacting her, but had also asked her out for a drink. The fourth complainant, Miss B, whom the  said they also found honest and truthful, said Noble had phoned her three times, to insist he needed to meet her at her home, alone. Giving evidence, she described Noble as being too pushy, adding he just wouldnapost lay off, and in the end she lied about having moved away from the Midlands to stop his calls. It felt a little bit like the way my ex treated me, putting pressure on me, doing things I donapost want to, she said. Mr Hawkins said Miss B had no reason to lie about her interactions, which had happened some years ago, adding that she told the  she was giving evidence because it might help another woman get justice. Miss A, Miss B and Miss C all came forward to report Noble following publicity surrounding his criminal trial at Birmingham Crown Court in , in which he was acquitted of a charge of misconduct in a public office in connection with the allegations made by Miss X. Nick Hawkins, the legally qualied chairman giving the tribunalaposs findings, said they found the evidence given by Noble to be inconsistent at time, and in some cases attempting to fit his explanations to known facts.  Mr Hawkins added that the tribunal found signicant evidence of Noble using sexualised talk and making inappropriate suggestions to Miss X. The  considered the improbability of the chances the four female witnesses, who had never met each other, nor seen each otheraposs statements, or knew of each otheraposs allegations, making such strikingly similar allegations, he said. Either Pc Noble was extremely unfortunate in thatall invented allegations that were strikingly similar, or they are telling the truth and the similarities are because they reflect the way Pc Noble behaves with vulnerable victims of domestic violence. Mr Hawkins said: The  concluded the most likely explanation is they are telling the truth and the events happened as alleged. Graham Henson, Nobleaposs barrister, told the  his client had a long, unblemished record, however the tribunal decided the constableaposs breaches of professional standards were so serious he should be dismissed without notice. Mr Hawkins told Noble: Your behaviour towards these women was totally unprofessional and inappropriate. Rather than offering assistance, you sought to further a relationship with each of the four women. He added: The way you treated them was appalling.

The -year-old heir-to-the-throne appeared close to tears as he and other senior royals, including sister Princess Anne and sons William and Harry, walked behind the Duke of Edinburghaposs coffin on Saturday. He travelled to his cottage at Llwynywermod, South Wales, after the service and is reported to be working and responding to letters from well-wishers while continuing to mourn his father. The royals remain in an official two-week period of mourning, which means the Queenaposs th birthday on Wednesday - the first of her reign without Philip - will be toned down.It is said that Charles had a brief chat with William, , and Harry, , in the grounds of Windsor Castle after Philipaposs funeral as Harry saw members of his family for the first time since he and we Meghan Markle quit as senior royals a year ago. Sources told the Mirroraposs Royal Editor Russell Myers that Harry wrote his father a deeply personal note before the service in a bid to ease tensions within the family, and Charles was hoping to see his son after the service but the Duke of Sussex told him he wasnapost sticking around.Harry also saw his family in person for the first time since the Sussexesapos bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here.Sources told the Evening Standard that Charles was back at work shortly after the family said their final goodbyes to Philip at St Georgeaposs Chapel.They said the Prince of Wales “got back to business” at his country home in Wales because “it is what his father would have wanted”. He was “taking the time to reply to the deluge of correspondence” he has received since Philip died in his sleep at Windsor Castle earlier this month. It was “all hands to the deck” at Charlesapos official London residence, Clarence House, where staff were going through thousands of letters of condolence from around the world, sources added. His we Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, is thought to have stayed behind in London due to private commitments. Charles has assumed his fatheraposs role as patriarch of the Royal Family and will accompany the Queen to the opening of Parliament on May , as he has done in recent years as Philip stepped back from public le in his final years. Charles has also inherited the Duke of Edinburgh title, which will pass to his youngest sibling, Prince Edward, when he becomes king. It is said that one of Charlesapos priorities as the familyaposs patriarch is plotting the future of the monarchy for the coming decades.He is planning to hold a summit with William to decide the future of the monarchy over the next two generations, thereported.In consultation with the Queen, the next two kings will decide how many full-time working members the family should have, who they should be, and what they should do, sources told the newspaper.Earlier this month, an exclusive poll for the Mirror suggested the public want the Crown to bypass Charles and be handed to William when the Queen’s reign ends.Another matter looming over the royals is the rt between members of the family and Harry and Meghan. Reports suggest the Queen has given her support to Charles and William to deal with the feud and the fallout of the Sussexesapos Oprah interview.  A source told MailOnline: The Queen has made it clear to senior advisers that she is united with Charles and William, and was disappointed with aspects of Harry and Meghanaposs interview.The source added: There is much pain and hurt on both sides, so this reconciliation will take place in baby steps. First, they need to decide on some ground rules as to how they conduct business going forward in a way that makes all parties feel safe and protected. After the funeral, Harry was seen chatting with William and Kate Middleton outside the chapel. The duchess later slipped away to allow the brothers time to talk alone as they walked back to the castleaposs private apartments.  Kate has been called a peacemaker after photos and footage of the moment emerged. It is said she has found the rt upsetting and wants to bring her husband and brother-in-law closer again.A source told the : “Being so close to her own siblings, Pippa and James, and having witnessed first hand the special bond between William and Harry, she has found the whole situation dficult and upsetting.Her natural instinct is to try to smooth things over.”There were claims that Charles, Harry, William and Kate later met at nearby Frogmore Cottage for clear-the-air talks, though other reports have said the father and sons did not hold a private or y summit to address the rt.A source claimed to the Sun: “Harry obviously felt outnumbered as there are three of them and only one of him so wanted it to be on his home turf.“There is no way this is the end of the crisis in their relationships but it’s a good gesture and a nice way to take the first step towards healing. “William, Kate and Charles all left after about two hours, which was long enough for the process of getting father and brothers talking again to start.” The source claimed William and Harryaposs cousin Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, who now live at Frogmore Cottage with their son August, made themselves scarce during the alleged meeting between the brothers, Kate and Charles. Harry was staying at Frogmore Cottage, on the Queenaposs Windsor estate, after flying in from Los Angeles for the funeral.  Frogmore is where the Sussexes lived with baby Archie before quitting their roles as senior royals and moving to Calornia a year ago. Meghan, who is pregnant with a baby girl and is due to give birth this summer, and one-year-old Archie stayed behind in suburban Los Angeles while Harry ed for Philipaposs service. Buckingham Palace said Meghanaposs doctor advised her not to travel due to her pregnancy. It was Harryaposs first trip home since he and Meghan quit as senior royals and since the Oprah interview in which the Sussexes plunged the monarchy into crisis.

It is said that they talked for two hours in the first step towards healing a family feud that was made worse by Harry and we Meghan Markleaposs bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey last month. However, other sources have insisted there was no summit and Harry was poised to fly back to Calornia without having any private talks with his father and older brother. Sources told the Mirroraposs Royal Editor Russell Myers that Harry wrote his father a deeply personal note before the funeral in a bid to ease tensions, and Charles was hoping to see his son after the service but the Duke of Sussex told him he wasnapost sticking around. Harry, William and Kate were seen chatting together after the service, with the duchess slipping away to give the brothers time to talk alone as they walked from the chapel to the castleaposs private apartments.

Kate has been called a peacemaker after she was seen chatting with the brothers and then stepping away to give William and Harry time to talk alone.

The Duke of Sussex flew back to the UK following his grandfatheraposs death and joined other members of The Firm to walk behind his coffin during Saturdayaposs event. While he was seen chatting to brother Prince William and Kate, an insider has said things have been frosty with other family members since he ed to Windsor to self-isolate.Princess Anne, Prince Edward and his we Sophie Wessex reportedly didnapost speak or even acknowledge him at all, claims the Mail on Sunday.A source told the newspaper: Ironically the only one who has expressed any sympathy towards him is Prince Andrew. He knows from Sarah Ferguson – and now first-hand – how it feels to be the outsider, which Harry very much is. As far as the others are concerned, there is a deep sense of protection towards the Queen and resentment towards Harry. There is little sympathy for him after what he and Meghan said on Oprah. They are still very upset. They are putting on a united front for the Queen. They all think he has behaved appallingly.  However Harry did speak to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the trio walked together from the chapel to the private apartments. After the service Charles signalled for the cars due to drive them back to drive on, deciding that the family would walk the short trip instead. Kate dropped back to allow the brothers to talk alone, which many experts believe gave them the opportunity to break the tension. Charles, William and Harry reportedly spoke for two-hours after the funeral, the first time they have been together since Meghan Markle and Harryaposs bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.

It comes amid conflicting reports over the extent of any private talks between the Prince of Wales and his warring sons following the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral in Windsor on Saturday.Sources told the Mirroraposs Royal Editor Russell Myers that Harry wrote his father a deeply personal note before the service in a bid to ease tensions within the family, and Charles was hoping to see his son after the service but the Duke of Sussex told him he wasnapost sticking around.It has been suggested the Queen, who turns  on Wednesday, would not be in the mood to host a summit and would leave it to Charles and William to address the Oprah interview and other issues at the heart of the rt.The grieving monarch faces the first birthday of her reign without her late husband Prince Philip, , who died in his sleep at Windsor Castle on April .Events for her th have been cancelled or toned down, with the Royal Family still in an official two-week period of mourning.

Coronavirus rules forced her to sit alone and wear a mask as just  socially-distanced guests were allowed at Philipaposs funeral.Reports suggest she has given her support to Charles and William to deal with the feud with Harry and the fallout of the Sussexesapos Oprah interview, which is said to have left William furious and many royals deeply hurt.A source told MailOnline: The Queen has made it clear to senior advisers that she is united with Charles and William, and was disappointed with aspects of Harry and Meghanaposs interview.The source added: There is much pain and hurt on both sides, so this reconciliation will take place in baby steps. First, they need to decide on some ground rules as to how they conduct business going forward in a way that makes all parties feel safe and protected. Grieving Charles, the Royal Familyaposs new patriarch, has gone to his estate in Llwynywermod in South Wales following his fatheraposs funeral. There were claims the Prince of Wales and his sons had a brief chat away from the cameras on Saturday. Harry was seen chatting with William and Kate Middleton outside St Georgeaposs Chapel, and the duchess later slipped away to allow the two brothers time to talk alone as they walked back to the castleaposs private apartments. Kate has been called a peacemaker after photos and footage of the moment emerged.  It is said she has found the rt upsetting and wants to bring her husband and brother-in-law closer again.A source told the : “Being so close to her own siblings, Pippa and James, and having witnessed first hand the special bond between William and Harry, she has found the whole situation dficult and upsetting.Her natural instinct is to try to smooth things over.”There were claims that Charles, Harry, William and Kate later met at nearby Frogmore Cottage for clear-the-air talks, though other reports have said the father and sons did not hold a private or y summit to address the rt. A source claimed to the Sun: “Harry obviously felt outnumbered as there are three of them and only one of him so wanted it to be on his home turf.“There is no way this is the end of the crisis in their relationships but it’s a good gesture and a nice way to take the first step towards healing. “William, Kate and Charles all left after about two hours, which was long enough for the process of getting father and brothers talking again to start.” The source claimed William and Harryaposs cousin Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, who now live at Frogmore Cottage with their son August, made themselves scarce during the alleged meeting between the brothers, Kate and Charles. Royal biographer Ingrid Seward said it is unlikely the Queen would want to be involved in any kind of family summit to address the rt, at this stage at least.Ms Seward told the Times: “Hisgrandmother will not be in the mood for it. She hates confrontation. The children have much dficulty getting the Queen to discuss anything other than dogs or horses. “I remember Fergie telling me it took three weeks for them to try and get her to discuss their orce. She kept saying ‘Oh, I’ve got to take the dogs for a walk’.” Harry was staying at Frogmore Cottage, on the Queenaposs Windsor estate, after flying in from Los Angeles for the funeral. It is where the Sussexes lived before quitting their roles as senior royals and moving to Calornia a year ago. Meghan, who is pregnant with a baby girl and is due to give birth this summer, and one-year-old Archie stayed behind in suburban Los Angeles while Harry ed for the funeral.  Buckingham Palace said Meghanaposs doctor advised her not to travel due to her pregnancy. It was Harryaposs first trip home since he and Meghan quit as senior royals and since the Oprah interview in which the Sussexes plunged the monarchy into crisis. The couple alleged that a member of the family - not the Queen or Duke of Edinburgh - made a racist comment about their unborn son. Ms Winfrey was left open-mouthed when the American duchess - the first mixed-race member of the modern monarchy - said a fellow royal was worried about how dark their son Archieaposs skin tone might be before he was born. The duchess also spoke about having suicidal thoughts but claimed her approaches to the monarchy for help were turned down.

With the Royal Family still in an official two-week period of mourning, events marking the Queenaposs birthday have been cancelled or toned down.She has been shielding with about  members of staff during the coronavirus pandemic, but has received more visits from family since Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased.Her daughter Princess Anne and daughter-in-law Sophie Wessex were to be among her first visitors ahead of her birthday, sources told the Mirror. The Queen will also be visited by her son Prince Andrew, granddaughter Princess Eugenie and her newborn son August - one of the monarchaposs ten great-grandchildren - in the coming days.The Duchess of Cornwall, who is also set to visit the Queen in the coming days, has dedicated the second season of her online book club in memory of “great fellow reader” Prince Philip.Her husband Prince Charles has travelled to his Welsh home in Llwynywermod where he is working from home and continuing to observe the royal mourning period which ends on Thursday.The Mirror exclusively reported how Prince Harry wrote his father a deeply personal note ahead of his homecoming for Philip ’s service - but the pair have not repaired their shattered relationship ahead of histo the Calornia. The Mirror also revealed how the royals had agreed a rota to visit the Queen so she is not alone as she continues to grieve for her beloved husband. She has insisted she is “coping” after her companion of  years was laid to rest on Saturday, but will be supported by her closest family members during her darkest hour. Coronavirus lockdown rules forced her to sit alone as only  mourners were permitted at Philipaposs socially-distanced funeral. The nation was moved by the heartbreaking image of her sitting alone and wearing a face mask as she gazed at her husbandaposs coffin inside St Georgeaposs Chapel.

She is said to have carried a photo of her and the Duke of Edinburgh as newlyweds in Malta and one of his pocket squares in her handbag.This week, the monarch is hoping to take advantage of the good weather as much as possible to join family members to walk her two new corgi puppies Fergus and Muick.Fergus is named after her uncle Fergus Bowes-Lyon, who was killed as he led an attack on the Germans during the First World War, while Muickis named after Loch Muick on the Queenaposs Balmoral estate in Scotland.The Queen is expected to have a quiet lunch with close family members at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, the details of which will remain private, thereported. It was unclear whether she would be visited by her grandson Prince Harry, who flew back to the UK to attend his grandfatheraposs funeral.One palace insider said Charles was hoping to see his son again after Philipaposs funeral but Harry told him he wasn’t sticking around.The service was the first time Harry had met up with his family since he and we Meghan Markle quit their roles as senior royals, and since their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey last month.For her birthday, it is thought the Queen will also have video calls with family, including William and Kateaposs children. Plans to release a new portrait are reportedly set to be shelved. For the second year in a row, there will be no birthday gun salutes due to the period of mourning.  Last year, the Queen decided not to celebrate her birthday in a special way during the first coronavirus lockdown, opting to speak with family members through private video calls. She spent her th birthday with Philip but stayed away from other members of the family as they followed social distancing rules amid the pandemic. She continued to stay at Windsor with around  staff members, dubbed HMS Bubble. Her official birthday is celebrated in June and is usually marked by the annual Trooping the Colour parade, although that will not go ahead in its traditional form for a second year due to the pandemic. The female leads within the family - her daughter Princess Anne, daughters-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall and the Countess of Wessex, supported by the Duchess of Cambridge - have come together to form the rota for visits.  Royal sources confirmed the Queen is expected to have a series of regular visitors as she continues to live at Windsor Castle, where she spent the majority of the last  months living with her darling Philip. One source said: “The Queen will not be alone. “She will have others who care about her deeply and want to be there to support her in her most pressing hour. “In typical fashion the Queen has insisted she is coping and despite the suggestion she had prepared herself for this day to come, everyone is well aware there is nothing like the experience when it comes.”Charles and William are said to be “completely focussed” on supporting the Queen.  As a way of supporting her they have scheduled a meeting to sort out future business of the monarchy and design tailor made roles for each of the seven senior members of The Firm. It will include collaboration and support for one another from the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne and the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Palace sources say the two future kings are “totally aligned“ that there is “no way back” for Prince Andrew, while controversy still exists over his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The heir and his son will carve up future engagements and projects as well as major tours for seven senior members of the royal family. Meanwhile, reports suggest the Queen has given her support to Charles and William to deal with the feud with Harry and the fallout of the Sussexesapos Oprah interview. A source told MailOnline: The Queen has made it clear to senior advisers that she is united with Charles and William, and was disappointed with aspects of Harry and Meghanaposs interview.The source added: There is much pain and hurt on both sides, so this reconciliation will take place in baby steps.

The -year-old went to visit his new business venture last March in the early days of coronavirus lockdowns in the US with plans to stay for a week. The townaposs caretaker had travelled to check on his family so Brent agreed to step in for him. Brent, who normally lives in Austin, Texas, drove the  hours to Calornia in search of adventure and a break. What do you think  Have your say in comments below He told Insider: I figured I would roll a nice road trip into a little break, and that little break has become a longer break. Iaposm okay with that. Brent said Cerrod Gordo has a long and bloody history after police left its , residents to their own devices with it being three hours outside of Los Angeles. At one point, the town averaged around a murder a week, and miners living there were forced to put sandbags in their bunks to stop stray bullets during the night. There is evidence to show of its gory past - bullet holes in the walls, blood stains on the floor of the saloon, and a cemetery filled with the graves of hundreds of miners but despite this, all the townaposs  buildings are still standing. Brent said that shows apossome strengthapos as the town also survived the Spanish influenza in . Brentaposs plans tohome were thwarted by a snowstorm which has not only stopped him from ing home but it means his plans to a stock up on groceries also hit the buffers as the weather has blocked the road.This means he is unable to make the -mile journey so instead has been relying on his supply of rice, beans, and canned soup. He also aposluckilyapos found cans of food that previous residents have left behind in the two-bedroom house he is living it. Some of it may have been expired, but when desperate times call for desperate measures ... I hope these somewhat-expired baked beans donapost hurt me too bad, he said. Belshaw House also has a bathroom but no running water.  But Brent, who also owns a hostel, is able to check on his family and communicate with his workers and business partners as the town does have Internet albeit being too slow for streaming sites.This means the likes of Netflix is off the cards but Brent said heaposs aposok with itapos as it means he has been forced to aposslow downapos.With so much time on his hands Brent has been exploring the town and is making new discoveries every day. Heaposs uncovered a bible that dates back to , a psalm booklet dedicated to a student in , and a briefcase in an old general store. The aposcrazyapos briefcase find opened the lid on how the miners lived back then as it contained personal documents which Brent said included aposbank statements, orce settlements, lawsuits, mining claims, love letters and hate lettersapos.  Brent is able to take some stunning photographs as the nearest town is  miles away so there is no aposlight pollutionapos.He has also spotted mysterious dferent animalsapos footprints in the snow but thanks to an animal tracking community on Reddi t he has been able to have them identied after uploading images online.Identied animals include foxes, rabbits and bobcats with the latter sparking a special interested in Brent. He decided to try and track down the creatures and it succeeded as he found one living in an old mine tunnel. However on one haunt he spotted a large print in the snow which no one has been unable to identy so he thinks it could be a aposBigfootapos creature.  The town is also rumoured to be haunted.The crew of the TV showGhost Adventuresonce investigated Cerro Gordo for paranormal activity.They believe the ghosts of two children are trapped in the closet of the Belshaw House where Brent has been staying. Brent said rumour also has it that  miners got trapped in one of the mines underneath Belshaw House and their remains are there.

The treadmill poses serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death, it added.

draw, Advocaat was full of praise for Jocky Scott’s side.“Any team in the world could play against this Dundee team and drop points,” he said after the game in which he had fielded the likes of Stefan Klos, Lorenzo Amoruso, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Jorg Albertz and Andrei Kanchelskis.Dundee’s results against the Old Firm that term included -, -, -, - and - scorelines.Rangers led Celtic in the title race by three points with six games to go but had seen a big lead slip away thanks to defeats to Dundee United and St Johnstone.With the Dark Blues favourites for the drop at the start of the season and Rangers the bookies’ choice to lt the title, that there would be anything other than a routine away win was unexpected.However, Jocky’s side that year had something about it – their first point of the season came against Jo Venglos’ Hoops.They were still in a relegation fight but had picked up form heading into the contest in strange surroundings.And would go on to finish in fth place thanks to a late flurry of wins, no doubt spurred on by an excellent display against the Gers at Tannadice.“We were on a good run at that time and we were desperate not to make a big deal about playing the game at Tannadice,” recalls Barry Smith, Dundee captain at the time.“All we wanted to do was keep the results coming so we treated it as a normal game – even though it wasn’t at Dens.“Not playing at Dens was a big deal though, not having the crowd and playing in front of the South Enclosure.“There was a decent crowd there that day, evenI remember a few Dundee fans said they were going to boycott the game because it was at Tannadice.“But we were feeling good about things and just wanted to get playing games, no matter where.“We didn’t have any superstars in the team, we were really hard-working but it took us a while to gel that season.“There were a lot of good lads in that dressing-room and we really stuck together when it mattered.“That day we defended really well and were well-organised.“We didn’t want there to be any excuses because the game was at Tannadice – we had to make sure we got something.“It was an excellent Rangers team but we caused them problems and that came from playing with confidence.”Dundee had to play home games at the end of that season with reduced capacity as the Bobby Cox and Bob Shankly Stands were erected.The two stands had to be built in super-quick time to be ready for the start of the following season to meet new SPL rules.However, with Rangers the opposition, that meant missing out on a likely six-figure sum and denying thousands of fans the chance to see their teams in a crucial part of the season.The compromise was to sht the match to Tannadice.Of course, that angered fans of the Dark Blues and brought talks of boycott. To add fuel to that fire there were rumours swirling of a takeover attempt being planned by United.However, it became clear that this particular Dundee team very much enjoyed playing at Tannadice.They had already beaten United - on their own patch earlier in the season.And they would go on to beat their old foes once more two weeks after the Rangers clash.Dundee would also finish well clear of United in the table.“We beat United at Tannadice a couple of weeks later – we thought it was a great place to play!” adds Steven Boyack, a new signing that season.“That Dundee team worked as hard as it could. It was as honest a team as you could find.“We defended well that day and don’t forget we had a great goalie in Rab Douglas.“I set up the goal – it was probably one of few times I got out of my own half.“Playing Rangers or Celtic was always really tough but you would get space to play and we made the most of that.“I made the run forward and played it across for ft in Iain Anderson to head in.”It may have been a dferent experience for the players than they were used to at Tannadice, this time getting changed in the home dressing-room.But it was much the same for the fans as they took their usual derby sections.“The Dundee fans made plenty of noise after we went - up even though there were probably more Rangers supporters there,” continues Boyack.“In these games, you have to score first and it gave us something to hold onto.“I think we were around th or th in the league at that time with Dunfermline behind us.“We drew that one and were on a really good run that kept us up.#For Boyack, it was a big match – this was his chance to show Rangers what they were missing.The -year-old had been bought by Dundee from Ibrox to bolster their fight against the drop in February of that year.And he would play a big part in the revival of Jocky Scott’s team that season.Boyack’s debut on March  saw a - win over Hearts and they would go on to win five of the next seven matches to shoot right up the table.“That was my first game against Rangers after leaving Ibrox so I was desperate to be in that team,” he recalls.“That was one of my better games for Dundee so I definitely remember it!“It might have only been my third or fourth game since joining.“I think the gaffer may have played some of the squad players and left some of the main players out for a big game against Kilmarnock coming up.“That wouldn’t have been said out loud but that was the way the gaffer went.“Jocky Scott would always say games against Rangers or Celtic weren’t our fight really.#At that point the Rangers and Celtic teams were so good and you could easily take five or six.“There was no point getting a result against them but losing to say Dunfermline and them going above you in the table.”Boyack was a real menace for his old side that day.He created the opening goal for Anderson in the first half and almost set the same man up for a winner late on with a deft backheel.Tony Vidmar would head in an equaliser for the Gers in the second half.But that didn#t stop Boyack getting it in the neck the very same evening from an old team-mate, Rangers legend Ally McCoist.“It was a pm kick-off on TV but after the game was the PFA dinner and we all jumped into James Grady’s motor to get there.“I remember bumping into Coisty at the bar – he was at Killie at the time – and he’s giving it ‘what did you go and do that for !’ because Rangers were neck and neck with Celtic for the title.”EXCLUSIVE: Dundee midfield maestro Shaun Byrne and the frustration of being left on the bench\" title\"#EXCLUSIVE: Dundee midfield maestro Shaun Byrne and the frustration of being left on the bench# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp exclusive-dundee-midfield-maestro-shaun-byrne-and-the-frustration-of-being-left-on-the-bench embed # secretTNLhfCpL\" data-secret\"TNLhfCpL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-happened-city-tried-lead-way-housing","story":"IN , housing in Glasgow changed forever."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-dior-models-rock-runway-1955","story":"RENFREW Airport had never looked quite so stylishhellip"},{"url":null,"title":"susan-baird-glasgow-lord-provost-never-forgot-east-end-roots","story":" GLASGOWrsquoS longest serving councillor of modern times and the cityrsquos second female Lord Provost was a bold and bright breath of fresh air in local politics.

company has won a major contract to supply bottles to the famous Gangnam District of Seoul in South Korea.Deeside Mineral Water, based in Ballater is also in the process of negotiating to distribute its new Fuarain moisturising cream to the Korean capital.The family-owned firm, which celebrates its th anniversary this year, bottles spring water from the Cairngorms National Park.The company has already shipped more than , bottles to Korea.Managing director of Deeside Mineral Water, Martin Simpson, said: “We export to many countries including Japan, Russia and the EU.“Paperwork issues around exporting to the EU make that impossible just now but this Korea contract has been fantastic to secure.“The springs have a long and interesting history dating back to  when they became famous for the healing waters.“The rich heritage and natural source in a remote and stunning part of Scotland is something that really appeals to overseas markets.”Distributors Myeong-Yin Kaizen Co have been supplying the water to health-conscious customers.The firm’s CEO, Mr Chulho Kim, said: “Korean customers like the purity and fresh taste of Deeside Mineral Water as well as its Scottish heritage.“Users tell us they feel good drinking it and that it helps their skin.“We are also really interested in the company’s latest venture, Fuarain Skincare, and we are looking at importing it too.”In the later part of last year, the company launched Fuarain moisturising cream where Deeside Mineral Water is the main ingredient.Martin Simpson said that while launching a new product during lockdown was risky, the company saw a growth in online sales for Fuarain.He added: “We also saw interest from retailers in the UK and abroad.“It’s already been shortlisted for a global beauty award as Best New Premium Skincare Product in the highly acclaimed Pure Beauty Awards.“Koreans are well known for looking after their skin and it seems a natural step to supply Fuarain to customers who already know what drinking Deeside Mineral Water can do for their skin.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

single could soon be gracing the big screen after the pair were signed by music labels in both the US and China for use in films, adverts and television programmes.Twins Mark James Scott and Darren Scott, better known by their stage name SHY # DRS, released their second single from their second album Act Your Wage recently.And that track, #Save Me#, could soon feature on TV and film soundtracks after being snapped up by Chinese and US music labels who will promote it for that purpose.While the song was written two years ago, the brothers, who are from Bridge of Don, think this is the right time to release it having witnessed how the pandemic has affected a lot of people’s mental health.#It was good timing in that sense, because you see more and more people on Facebook and social media posting about mental health awareness during lockdown, sharing memes, videos and inspirational quotes,# Darren said.#So I think this is the best time to get an inspiring song out as this is what people need to hear right now.#The -year-old twins, renowned for rapping in Scottish accents, released the single on Spoty and shared its drop on Instagram too.It#s from there that they were contacted askingthey#d be interested in putting it forward for a music synchronisation license, or #sync# for short, meaning it can be picked up for media output such as film, television shows, advertisements, video games and trailers.#We#ve been really shocked by the response as we didn#t put any cash behind the single in terms of promotion,# Darren added.#And it#s been brilliant to have been picked up by the Chinese and American labels.#Hopefully we can get used in an advert or as part of a film or programme in time.#The Chinese market is one of the biggest music markets going, which I didn#t realise, so this opens us up to a massive and a heap of opportunities and new audiences.#The pair also got in touch with a number of UK mental health charities askingthey could share the song in the hopes it would reach the people who need to hear it the most.The track #Save Me# has also been released with an accompanying music video, filmed pre-pandemic, featuring Tain actress Lauren Jayne Macdonald.Darren wrote the duo’s latest album while furloughed during lockdown.His brother meanwhile contributed between creating graphic designs and marketing for US rapper The Game.Their previous release, Flex, become an internet sensation last year thanks to a playful video filmed near Peterhead.The video, which attracted , views in its first week online, featured three child actors from Aberdeen Academy for Performing Arts, who dressed as cowboys and mimed along to the lyrics while throwing cash around # surrounded by alpacas and Highland cows.For as little as £. a month you can

you might be looking forward to getting back on the dancefloor at your favourite Aberdeen nightclubs.For more than a year, the city#s once-packed venues have been silent after the wholesale shutdown of the industry when lockdown hit.If you#re struggling to recall what it#s like to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with complete strangers at a bar or peel your ballet pumps off a sticky dancefloor, we#ve taken a look back at some of Aberdeen#s premier nightspots of the s to jog your memory.A staple of Aberdeen#s live music scene from when it opened in  was rock club Moshulu.The popular venue hosted a number of bands, artists, themed nights and # to the delight of the city#s student population # dirt-cheap drink deals.Tucked away on Windmill Brae, just around the corner from well-known Aberdeen club Liquid, it was a treacherous journey walking between the two for anyone wearing high heels, negotiating the slippery, cobbled streets.Back in , the club hosted notorious indie band Babyshambles # a night that made the headlines and went down in Moshulu legend.Gig-goers got more than they bargained for when frontman Pete Doherty decided to do an encore afterwards # on the street.With an acoustic guitar in hand, Doherty sat down on the pavement and had a singalong with fans.Of course, the impromptu gig didn#t pass without incident, and a BMW parked on the street was damaged during the shenanigans.Moshulu closed many years later and took on the guises of Warehouse and Bassment, before becoming The Garage Campus.The club continued to host big-name musicians, including former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in , but closed down for good in .Many a night out in Aberdeen ended up at The Priory on Belmont Street where people could party into the wee hours before stumbling to catch the night bus home.When it opened its doors in , the vast former church became a popular place for students with its huge dancefloor, long bar and luminous purple lights.The galleries above provided an excellent vantage point for watching dodgy dancing below, while many punters accidentally ended up on the basement floor en route to the toilets.And you haven#t been on a night out in Aberdeenyou haven#t witnessed someone singe their eyebrows on a Purple Rain # The Priory#s signature flaming cocktail.The club closed in , but fans weren#t left out in the cold for long as it was resurrected under a new name, Redemption, after a six-figure renovation.Another classic Aberdeen club of the noughties, Espionage # known as Espo to locals # provided three floors of fun at its Union Street venue.Still open today in non-Covid times, when punters aren#t enjoying one of its two dancefloors, they are probably lost inside the vast venue trying to find their pals.The club has also hosted lots of DJs and RnB nights over the years, and is conveniently located for the taxi rank and a am trip to McDonalds.Despite being a bit of a Trek from other clubs, Snafu was considered a cool haunt and attracted a vibrant crowd.The small, but eclectic club opened in  and appealed to an arty clientele with its quirky cocktail menu and jam-packed events programme.From electro nights to Franz Ferdinand, the boutique basement club at the city#s Castlegate was even crowned Scottish Nightclub of the Year in .Its events attracted clubbers from across Scotland and there was always a solid art school crowd sprawled on the low, leather sofas in the lounge area.As well as comedy nights, many charity fundraisers were also held at the venue, but it closed down and after city empty became a BrewDog Bar in .Another old church-turned-nightclub, The Pearl Lounge on Dee Street was instantly recognisable with its giant pearl logo when it opened in .The venue had been a nightclub since the s when it operated as The Ministry of Sin.For many years it was a popular student stomping ground that did #doorhandle deals# # where drinks offers would be hung on doors in student halls.And in the s, it was impossible to walk down Union Street on a Saturday night without bumping into the PR team from The Pearl Lounge leafleting revellers.A busy venue, there was always a queue to get in and often the queue to get drinks at the bar was even longer.The Pearl Lounge closed in  and went out in style hosting a UV-themed evening with drinks from p.A long-time clubbing venue, Aurum on the city#s Diamond Street was once s venue Ruffles.The glam venue was popular throughout with clubbers and music fans alike, hosting world-famous singer Basshunter in .And for fashionista#s the venue also held a number of charity fashion shows and pageants over the years.Aurum was reinvented as Mint Luxury Club, before becoming One Diamond Street in , a plush bar which included a table with a minimum spend of £,.The venue was only open for two months before plans were announced to change it into a restaurant # DS.And no lookback at Aberdeen#s nightclubs would be complete without a visit to Exodus # fondly known as Exo # the only city nightspot open seven days a week.A favourite of students over the years, the alternative venue on Schoolhill was ideally located for the the former RGU union.With a iety of themed nights # from Motown to pop, rock and indie classics # Exodus is still going strong.At Exo it#s a more alternative crowd that rocks out on the tightly-packed dancefloor, which is always a guaranteed sweat-fest.Andyou were a student, a yellow card back in the day was a dream ticket to cheap entry, cheaper booze and pitchers of pints. For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown. We have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust, like everyone , to the daily challenges this  has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares. We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.Let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind PeopleScotland, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures march 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In a social media statement, he wrote: #Very sad to hear Jock MacVicar has died. I first met Jock when playing in the  Scottish Boys Championship at Dunbar. He was always very supportive and knowledgeable. We spoke a few months ago. Speaking to Jock was like talking to an old friend. He will be very sadly missed.#An eminent professional, Jock continued working right up until he died, and would surely have enjoyed reporting on Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre#s Masters debut.Our thoughts are with all Jock#s friends and family at this dficult time.It was an emotional experience watching the first helicopter land at the new Robert Black Memorial Helipad last week.It is less than a year since heroic paramedic Robert Black died after a battle with Covid- and his loss is still felt acutely in the community.To see his memory being immortalised through something which will undoubtedly save many lives for years to come is particularly poignant."},{"url":null,"title":"letters april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke.

Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page.

If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have staff, more volunteers, moved to larger premises and do much more than shopping.April is our birthday month where we celebrate on the th and th, when we became a company and a charity respectively. So many people have been part of these years and there are many memories to look back on, so many people to thank who have supported us in many dferent ways.We won awards for helping older people – Herald Society in  and Age Scotland in , raised funds with raffles, walking, running, getting covered in mud, quizzes, bingo, making and selling fairy doors, alpacas, books and eggs. We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"happy monday scotlands grand reopening","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something.

Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a national crisis.Now we need to elect more MSPs that will treat it as that.We immediately need to see a resumption of mental health First Aid training.This was suspended for the pandemic, yet physical First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East

Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment

build the post-Covid recovery of public services.They have already rejected Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit shambles and its  promise to spend billions more on the NHS.I believe East Lothian voters will similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public trust, and trust is fundamental in this election.Which leader do you trust to form a government that represents your values and prioritises public services meeting your communityrsquos needs

a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the

country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-world-champion-josh-taylor-vows-visit-aidan-hogg","story":"Josh will step into the ring with Jose Ramirez for the most important

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way! The flowers will die off and the little tomatoes will begin to form ndash thatrsquos when gardeners will happily report that ldquothe first truss has set!Once the first truss is set, yoursquoll need to provide additional feeding and this is best done in liquid form whilst watering using a specialist feed such as the well-respected lsquoTomoritersquo, for example.As the season progresses, you may decide to remove some of the older leaves to let more light in and help the fruit ripen. For tomatoes that havenrsquot ripened at the end of the season, use them in the green for chutney or bring them indoors and leave them on the windowsill to ripen.And then...If yoursquove enjoyed growing your own tomatoes and plan to do it again next year, make sure that you remove the old plants completely so that yoursquore not leaving any rotting vegetation and disease that could affect next yearrsquos tomatoes.As always, the plant team are always very happy to help with tips and advice ndash so much easier now that wersquore allowed to be open again, of course!Yoursquoll also find lots of information on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"doors-reopening-dirleton-castle-tantallon-castle","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandis preparing to open the gates to more than  ticketed sites, including Tantallon Castle, near North Berwick, and Dirleton Castle, across the country this month.The historic sites will open on April  following the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed dates for the reopening of the tourism sector and mainland Scotland moving to Covid protection level three.New technology is also being implemented as part of HESrsquos new visitor offering.Visitors will be able to explore the stories of many of the sites in innovative ways through downloadable maps, family trails, quizzes and quests, music, poetry and personal accounts to tell stories throughout the centuries, videos exploring Gaelic culture and words, and digital fly-throughs to areas usually restricted to visitors.Visitors will be able to enjoy access to the historic outdoor spaces at both sites, as well as the Doocot, Gazebo, Hallyburton Range and first floor of the Ruthven Range at Dirleton Castle.All visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations visitors must wear face coverings in any indoor enclosed spaces, including retail and catering areas and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe know how keen our members and visitors are to get back to our sites, so wersquore delighted to reopen over  per cent of our properties on April .ldquoScotlandrsquos heritage sector is a key part of our tourism offer ndash from providing jobs to increasing our wellbeing ndash and, in addition to reopening the sites that reopened last year, we will also reopen further sites on a phased basis over the upcoming months.Tantallon Castle will open daily, am-pm, from April , while Dirleton Castle will open on the same date and from then on will be open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays between the same times.For more information, go to restarthistory.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prince-philips-visits-east-lothian","story":"On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the news of his death, mere months before his th birthday, saying that he passed away peacefully last Friday morning at Windsor Castle.Since then people across the world have been sharing their condolences and been paying tribute to the late Duke, including here in East Lothian.Over the years the Duke of Edinburgh has visited East Lothian on several occasions, both solo and with the Queen, to whom he was married to for more than  years.From Haddington and North Berwick to Musselburgh and the opening of Yellowcraig Caravan Park in , he has visited several parts of the county over his  years.One of his first visits is believed to be in  with the then Princess Elizabeth, a year before her coronation.Over the years he re-visited the county on several occasions.Another was  when he inspected the British Legion parade in North Berwick, he also opened Yellowcraig Caravan park in .He has also visited Haddington on numerous occasions, in ,  and .Prince Philiprsquos last public visit is believed to be with the Queen, who was  years old at the time, to Musselburgh Racecourse in , when the couple helped it celebrate its th birthday.

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw. This was Campbell country when he lived here, but he was under the protection of a Campbell chief, how ironic was that  Robrsquos mother had been a Campbell, and yoursquove seen how MacGregors could be both enemies and family with Campbells.She pointed at the base of the ruins: ldquoThose stones are the foundations of the old walls. Now close your eyes for a moment, Finn. Imagine we are in the house in Robrsquos time. There are no windows, a thatched roof above us and a peat fire is in the middle, with a smoky heat filling the room. Now open your eyes, can you see the house as it used to be Finn opened his eyes and looked around.ldquoYes, I think so.ldquoCan you smell the peat smoke in your imagination ldquoI donrsquot know what it smells like aunty.ldquoItrsquos a sweet smoke.ldquoI smell it now.ldquoNow look up, can you see how the soot from the fire has made the rafters of the roof all black ldquoYeah, itrsquos all sooty.ldquoWe are sitting in the very place of the story, said Izzy. ldquoRight where you are, sat Rob Roy himself.ldquoNo aunty, hersquos next to me, otherwise hersquoll be on my knee, joked Finn.ldquoAll right then, of course, hersquos next to you, chuckled his aunt.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-champion-josh-taylor-speaks-preston-lodge-pupils","story":"Josh spoke online to a number of pupils from Preston Lodge High School about their achievements and

On land, solid placemarkers will map the trail, carved in reclaimed red Arran sandstone, the lettering on each slab designed both to pay tribute to ancient Arran waymarkers and echo the work of the concrete poet and artist Ian Hamilton Finlay, who was ldquoa big presence in Corrie, as Ruth Impey, project manager of the Arts Heritage Trail, puts it. The locations were chosen in collaboration with islanders.Itrsquos a hugely ied roster of artists, as erse as the landscapes of the island itself. There is John Muir Wood, an early pioneer of photography in Scotland who made hundreds of images of Arranrsquos mountainous landscape. There is Alasdair Gray, who spent holidays at Pirnmill as a child and wrote the first story of his debut collection on the island. His marker is placed on the tourist trail up Goatfell, from where he painted his view, Bay.There is the eminent Victorian landscape painter Horatio McCulloch, whose aim was ldquoto paint the silence of the Highland wilderness where the wild deer roam ndash he obviously hadnrsquot been there during the rut ndash a putative silence which, of course, was occasioned by the Clearances.William McTaggartrsquos June Day, Arran , showed young children clambering over an ancient stone, again at Machrie. The th century brought the Corrie Summer School, the brainchild of Jessie M King and her husband EA Taylor, artists based in Paris who, from the summer of  to , attracted wider European artists and locals, including Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to stay with islanders all over Arran for their hugely successful art summer school in High Corrie. The Colourist Samuel Peploe, a friend of King, also painted here.But of all the painters, it is Eardley who is the best known modern artist associated with Arran. The pioneering mid-th painter spent the summers of her formative student years in Corrie, where she painted the shore in all weathers. If artists previously had frequently been inspired by the dramatically changeable weather on Arran, Eardley painted in it, the weather frequently marking her paintings, as was to be seen to mature effect in her later works at Catterline in Aberdeenshire.ldquoThe picture I painted yesterday was of a fir tree in the castle wood from the shore part of the Brodick road, she wrote from Corrie in  to her friend and fellow painter Margot Sandeman, with whom she often shared a but and ben named the Tabernacle in the village.ldquoI tried hard to finish it ndash but I havenrsquot, quite. About  orsquoclock, deluges of rain came on and I felt absolutely fed-up, and then I suddenly thought that I wasnrsquot going to be beaten by the blasted rain again. So I erected a little tent over my canvas with my mac and your bike and some pieces of ropehellip it must have looked pretty funny to the people from the roadhellip today it is raining, too, only this time there is a hurricane as well, and I donrsquot think the little tent would stay up.Pretty funny it perhaps was, or at least unusual, in the minds of some of the locals, including one five-year-old who still remembers seeing Eardley ldquopainting by the old port in Corrie, wearing oversized dungarees. She had her canvas and paints with her. He offered her his pocket money ldquobecause he thought she must be destitute! says Impey, who says theyrsquore hoping to collect many more local stories for the trail. A publication, with details of all the artists and locations, is nearing approval for the launch, although the database of artists is ever-expanding, testament to the inspirational lure of ldquoScotland in miniature.ldquoI think wersquove just scratched the surface, says Impey. ldquoEvery time we put a full stop on the database, we find another artist influenced by Arran.

The Tatha Gallery in Newport-on-Tay is one such, its latest exhibition,Into the Landscape, metamorphosing from an online tour to a flung-open door midway through its run.Into the Woods features three artists whose preoccupation is with the landscape, whether that is the self-evident beauty of a woodland view or the unexpected beauty in overlooked places.Anna King paints what is left behind after felling, a sycamore silhouetted against the spruce that surrounded it, shipping containers on the edge of a clearing, the edge of a quarry, working into her oils with pencil and other objects. Dominique Cameronrsquos work is inspired by her walking, and by the insular reality of her Cotswold village upbringing. Walking was her escape, and her stark charcoals ndash whether of brambles or field corners ndash continue to find inspiration in this.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"election-2021-lobbygate-independence-better-uks-pirate-republic","story":"Mr Winton, now sadly departed, was the flamboyant presenter of Supermarket Sweep, one of the most subversive shows in Britainrsquos formidable daytime television canon.

After all their friends and colleagues who helped themselves to multi-million PPE contracts seem not to have encountered any backlash in the polls.Labour politicians in the Tony Blair era were slightly more circumspect in the process of capitalising on their time in office. Blair himself built a massive property portfolio while pimping himself out as a sort of international, travelling peace salesman. In office, Blair committed British troops to seven wars, all of which provided him with ample opportunity to make the connections in the Arab world that would provide a few extra zeroes in his pension.

But now the privatising zeal of Margaret Thatcher has combined with Boris Johnsonrsquos contracts for cronies, to make this size issue more extreme.There are a lot more contracts knocking about and theyrsquove grown steadily larger, more complex and consequently lie even further beyond the reach of local firms.Big is automatically seen as a guarantor of success ndash even though banks that were \"too big\" did fail and small countries, with ultra-local government and a highly developed instinct for self-reliance have been held up as exemplars during the pandemic.EU procurement rules have been blamedfor carving local suppliers out, since contracts over a certain size had to be advertised across the whole European Union. But councils were always allowed to select bids based on quality, risk, social value, food miles and other factors besides price.The proof of that pudding is Preston Council which used the Cleveland Model to double its spending with local businesses in the pre-Brexit period of -. It used a weighting system that scored local labour recruitment and skills training to award contracts to local firms. In  Preston was declared the most improved city in the UK, by an independent Demos report and the cityrsquos unemployment rate halved as local procurement spending rose in the five years to .In Scotland, innovative councils like Aberdeen have also awarded public contracts to local food producers by inserting food miles into their selection criteria whilst remaining ldquoEU compliant.Where therersquos a will therersquos a way.So, does the absence of a Scottish Cleveland or Preston suggest a lack of political will here Community Wealth Building made an appearance in the SNPrsquos programme for government last year prompting councils like Glasgow City to trial small, pilot projects. According to leader Susan Aitken, the council now intends to build on its experience and announce a city-wide Circular Economy Action Plan.This is the scale of ambition neededthe Covid recovery and Green transition ndash more empty buzzwords during this election campaign ndash are not to become disappointing missed opportunities.We lack the \"patient capital\" that allowed Cleveland to set about transforming itself. But with this election, Scotland has a political opportunity to radically change procurement policy so that our council tax millions invest in local people to deliver local services.We need pump-priming councils who think like local economic dynamos, so that what goes around in taxpayer cash, comes around in locally sourced jobs.And we need a new Holyrood Government willing to lead by example.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

So eventheyrsquove seen the inside of a jail, therersquos always some shyster whorsquoll realise an ex-politician is a valuable asset for the payroll.Therein lies the formula for the lobbying industry and its relationship with former politicians: we pay politiciansrsquo salaries so they can skill up and flog their newfound talents to the highest bidder once theyrsquove left office, and their new paymasters can then rip off the taxpayer and exploit our democracy. A nice little earneryou can get it for all concerned ndash ordinary folk excluded obviously.You can tell that politics is a business in which politicians write the rules. Wersquore schmucks letting them get away with it. For proof of our collective schmuckhood, we once again, for the umpteenth time, find ourselves in the middle of a lobbying scandal: this time the Greensill affair.Itrsquos a vile swamp. Former Prime Minister David Cameron became an adviser for the finance firm Greensill after he left office. He was reportedly given share options worth tens of millions. Cameron contacted ministers, included chancellor Rishi Sunak, trying to get Greensill the largest possible allocation of government-backed loans under the Covid corporate financing facility. Cameron also took company boss Lex Greensill to private drinks with health secretary Matt Hancock. Lex Greensill previously had a role as lsquosenior advisorrsquo to Cameron when he was PM ndash a role in which Greensill was reportedly allowed to pitch financial projects across Whitehall.: Democracy in dangerThe scandal has thrown up all sorts of unpleasant truths, including the fact that civil servants are allowed to work for private industry while in office. Bill Crothers, former head of Whitehall procurement, became an adviser to Greensill while still employed by the civil service. John Manzoni, chief executive of the civil service, was allowed to keep a poundk a year job as a non-executive director of the company SABMiller.The stink isnrsquot confined to Westminster. Fergus Ewing, SNP rural economy secretary, had an unrecorded dinner with Lex Greensill, and steel billionaire Sanjeev Gupta. Wersquore told there were no officials with Ewing, no notes were taken. The government claims to have no emails, texts or phone records about happened. Deals struck between the SNP government, Gupta and Greensill exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of pounds of debt after Greensill collapsed. The ministerial code states that officials should be present for any discussions relating to government business, with facts recorded. Nicola Sturgeon claimsthat dinners which Fergus Ewing attended are ldquovery dferent from David Cameronrsquos antics and the SNP said that \"attempts to make mischief around this issue are utterly baseless.Inevitably, therersquos going to be a Greensill inquiry ndash there always is when one of these scandals erupts. But donrsquot expect anything to change. It never does. After all,wersquod learned anything from previous scandals, Greensill wouldnrsquot have happened. Nigel Boardman, appointed by Boris Johnson to run the inquiry, is on the board of a private bank with close ties to the Tory party and a number of former civil servants in its ranks.We can, however, nip all this in the bud immediately, and end the scandal of political lobbying once and for all. The one simple way to stop this gross exploitation of the public is to ban anyone whorsquos ever held political office from lobbying on behalf of business interests for le. Soyoursquove served one single day as an elected representative, yoursquore barred from lobbying your former colleagues on behalf of any corporate interest. No more Sir Nick Clegg working as Facebookrsquos lobbyist, for instance. We could go as far as banning politicians from all lobbying, but some has decent intent. It would be draconian to prevent lobbying for a charity, for instance ndash as long as that lobbying is done openly and without profit.: Where is the vision Therersquos some other changes we also need to clean up public le. The definition of what lobbying is needs to be claried in Scotland to ensure that all forms of communication are covered, and that politicians canrsquot wriggle out of scrutiny by playing semantics around what a lsquomeetingrsquo actually means. At the moment thatrsquos not clear, and lobbyists have been exploiting loopholes which require only lsquovisual interactionsrsquo to be registered. Phone calls and emails donrsquot have to be registered. Lobbying rules should also extend to civil servants ndash theyrsquore not covered by the register.So is change likely  The omens donrsquot look good. The SNP has a host of former big wigs working as lobbyists so I wouldnrsquot set any store in the party suddenly finding its moral conscience. The Tories basically invented the revolving door between lobbying and public le. When it comes to Labour, the MSP who led the charge in Holyrood against lobbying scandals, Neil Findlay, appeared to court companies to hire him as a lobbyist in advance of him standing down at this election.However, change is down to us. If we donrsquot order the politicians ndash whose salaries we pay ndash to legislate for the public standards we expect, then wersquoll have nobody to blame but ourselves when the next Greensill scandal inevitably happens.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

All these states must agree for a new stateto join the EEA.Notably, since ,  countries have successfully acceded to the EU, while not one has chosen the EEA route. That includes three former EFTAcountries ndash Austria, Finland and Sweden ndash joining the EU in . In fact, the Norwegian government wanted to join the EU but that was rejected in a referendum.One big plus of being in the EU is full representation in the European Parliament, Council and Commission plus a vote and say in decisions on the myriad of laws that underpin the EU internal market. Consultation processes within the EEA are much weaker.In , a Norwegian review of its EEA membership concluded, in the words of its chairman, professor Fredrik Sejersted, that there was a ldquogreat democratic deficit... but this is a kind of national compromise since Norway decided it did not want to join the EU\".Scotlandrsquos lsquoremainrsquo vote in  does not suggest it would choose such a democratic deficit.Mr Salmond argues that joining the EEA could be quicker and that Scotland could,it wanted, join the EU later. But the key determinant of speed of rejoining the EU would be Scotlandrsquos ergence from EU laws in the meantime. And that would impact on the speed of joining the EEA too. Nor could formal talks start until Scotland was independent.Certainly, there will need to be transition arrangements into the EU or EEA. But EU accession candidates normally agree a tailored Association Agreement the EEA is not a transition route. To join the EU, Scotland would need to clary its position on currency and be ready to move to its own currency after a few years. But that is entirely feasible.Being in the EEA or EU raises considerable issues on borders. There would be a major regulatory border with England and Walesin both set-ups. But in the EEA, there would also be a customs border with the EU, meaning no open border in either direction. In the EU, Scotland would face a hard customs and regulatory border to England but an open border to the EU.Mr Salmond suggests an independent Scotland could form a customs union with the UK nations. But EFTA states must aim to join existing EFTA trade deals ndash tricky not to say impossibleScotland was in a customs union with the rest of the UK.There is a view that EEA membership would benefit Scotlandrsquos fisheries sector. But the EU-UK trade deal has surely put paid to the idea that the EU would simply allow an independent Scotland into the EEA without a separate and good deal on access to fishing waters.In the end, an internationally recognised, independent Scotland could apply to join the EU or the EEA. But in the EEA it would have little say over the huge range of EU internal market laws. And being in a customs union with the UK would mean following its trade policy.

Its phenomenal success ndash . million tuned in for the opening episode of this series, not to mention the many whorsquoll watch again on iPlayer just to get to grips with some of those inpenetrabilities ndash reflects this.In an age when Black actors have sometimes been cast simply to tick a box or to mention in a producerrsquos annual appraisal, the scene between actors Martin Compston, Shalom Brune-Franklin and Adrian Dunbar in which it was revealed that institutional racism had played a part in a case they were examining, was trail blazing.They discussed a case where a young Black architect, Lawrence Christopher, had been attacked by a gang of white youths with a history of racial violence and taken into custody where he was mocked by police officers as he died from his injuries.The character Steve Arnott, played by Compston, turned to his Black colleague and said he was sorry she had ldquoto dredge all that up and askedshe was okay.She replied with a barely perceptible hint of pain in her voice: ldquoCustody officers were laughing and making monkey noises while Christopher lay dying. They were all cleared of misconduct, took early retirement for stresshellipand claimed tens of thousands of pounds in compensationhellip How could anyone be okay I choked on the power of this scene. DC Chloe Bishop for five episodes has played the almost emotionless foil for some of Steve Arnottrsquos hypothesesand suddenly out of nowhere we are reminded of her humanness and her blackness and her experience and her strength at having to deal with this case.At last here was a recognition that Black characters could be written to reflect the universal themes and stories that affect us all but that they also have experiences that only they can uniquely reflect or react to. Add to this the fact that Mercurio has based the storyline on the real le events around the murder of Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths in , and the death in police custody of Falklands veteran Christopher Alder in , and itrsquos clear that authenticity is at the heart of this episode.And authenticity is one of the great aims of ersity. Yes, ersity is also about fairness, representation, and inclusivity but for audiences and TV executives alike ersity brings new stories and crucially, dferent ways of telling stories.As someone who has worked in television for  years and counting, and been through countless  dawns where it felt like progress on representation was being made after a series of short-term initiatives only to be told an idea was ldquotoo niche or there ldquowasnrsquot enough Black or Asian talent out there, I am convinced that we have now crossed some sort of Rubicon.After last yearrsquos Black Lives Matter protests, UK broadcasters were swt to act. ITV launched an advertising campaign in support of the dance act Diversityrsquos Black Lives Matter-themed performance on Britainrsquos Got Talent. The performance had received , complaints to Ofcom for being ldquotoo political. ITVrsquos full-page ads in every newspaper featured a still from the performance which read: ldquoWe are changed by what we see. Just as we are changed when we are seen. Ofcom rejected the complaints.The BBC has earmarked pound million of its existing budget towards inclusive and erse content over the next three years. The money is available to those creating erse content, erse production leadership and erse-lead production companies. The definition of erse is Black or minority ethnic, disabled and those from lower-income backgrounds. The BBC is also asking all producers they work with to ensure % of their workforce are from under-represented groups.This is a mammoth but top-down effort that will bring rewards for all ndash for the audience with their ever increasing appetite for content, for the TV industry as a whole, but most of all I think, for those in under-represented groups who never imagined a career in film or TV was for them ndash the door is open.When I think of under-represented groups I think of the many schools I visited as a BBC education producer in the s all over Scotland but particularly in places like Castlemilk and Govanhill where few young people would have thought about a career working in film or television because it didnrsquot feel like the kind of environment for them. Thatrsquos the bit of all the high level strategies that really gets me excited and keeps me focussed on the importance of inclusion.The hope is to make the system ndash the broadcasting and content creation system ndash institutionally inclusive where every part of the system is interdependent on another part and all parts are pushing in the one direction towards genuine inclusivity. Once thatrsquos done we can do away with quotas and ring-fencing and initiatives and schemes and just get on with making the most creative content we can from a myriad of dferent voices."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12525532.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scot-launches-petition-make-vimto-vegan-again-recipe-change","story":"Many vegans have voiced their frustrations at the recipe change, which has altered the popular Vimto squash drink in a move that has been slammed as \"regressive and unnecessary\".Now, apetition has been launched by Scottish mental health nurse Ian Anderson to protest the recipe change.Mr Anderson, from Lochgilphead in Argyll, wrote on the petitions page: \"Vimto is a delicious fruit drink which was until recently - suitable for vegans.\"The recipe has now been altered to include an animal based Vitamin D ingredient.\"We the undersigned feel that this is a regressive and unnecessary decision when an increasing amount of people are becoming vegan and eating plant-based diets to oppose the abuse, exploitation, and killing of animals.\"Mr Anderson, , added: \"There is no reason why Vimto needs to contain animal products.\"Wecall on Nichols plc to either reverse this decision or to use a plant based Vitamin D such as Vitamin D. #MakeVimtoVeganAgain\"Vimtos website reads: ldquoAll of our Vimto squash drinks are suitable for Vegetarians, due to the recent addition of Vitamin D they are not suitable for Vegans.ldquoHowever, all of our other Vimto drinks iants, including fizzy and still ready to drink ranges, do not contain any animal products and as such, are suitable for vegetarians and Vegans."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeons-scotland-lockdown-update-7-things-need-know","story":"Speaking during the briefing today, the First Minister was able to confirm that easing of restrictions onApril  will be going ahead and all areas in mainland Scotland will move to level .This means that bars, restaurants, retail shops and beauty salons can reopen on Monday.She also outlined the easing of restrictions for travel around the UK and discussed international travel.Here, we outline the key points from her briefing.# Watch live: First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gives an update on #coronavirus #COVID# restrictions.Joining the First Minister is Chief Medical Office Dr Gregor Smith and National Clinical Director Jason Leitch. https:t.co nDsOhVTSpeaking of Scotlands lockdown exit strategy, Nicola Sturgeon said: \"Taking all of the recent data into account, I am pleased to be able to confirm today that from Monday  April, those parts of the country that are currently in level  will move to level .\"That of course includes all of mainland Scotland.\"We then expect that all of Scotland will move to level  on Monday  May.\"That means, for example, that from  May, people will be able to meet in small numbers in each otherrsquos homes, hospitality will reopen more fully, and outdoor contact sport for adults will resume.\"Then,circumstances permit, I can confirm that we will move to level  on Monday  June, before moving I hope to level  in late June ndash and then to something much more like normality over the course of the summer.\"Hospitality venues like cafes, pubs and restaurants can open until pm indoors, but without alcohol, and pm outdoors where alcohol is allowed to be consumed.Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place, such as a cafe or restaurant.All shops, stores and close contact services can open.Gyms can open for inidual exercise.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy. Shame on us."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MURAL-BIRCH-2.jpg","title":"donnie munro unveils sight for storr","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe landscape of the iconic island attraction is situated in Bayfield Road directly opposite Birch Cafe.The work was commissioned by Donnie’s son Niall who runs the coffee house.Niall said he wanted to bring an artistic flourish to the area for the enjoyment of both locals and visitors to the village., Niall Munro said: “The idea came about because the wall across from the cafe was in a total state of disrepair and there was a nice area that I thought was well suited for having a mural on it.“I mentioned it to my dad, but then didn’t really think much of it, but then I prompted him again and looked at it a bit more. He thought the landscape idea would be fitting.“We were thinking of locations and the Storr is quite an obvious one. We actually had an image of that particular view and thought that it would work really well.“It took a good few months to arrange because the wall belongs to Boots, so it took a bit of time to get the go ahead but we have got there.”He added: “From an arts point of view it is great to do something like this because it engages local interest as well as being for visitors.“It was very much just a way of brighting up the lane that we’re on anda by-product of it is that it benefits the other businesses here then great.”Like most business owners, Niall has experienced his fair share of obstacles due to the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. However, with Birch set to reopen at the end of April, he is excited about welcoming back customers with the cafe set to embark on a new venture.He said: “We are reopening at the end of the month and starting our own coffee roastery. We#ll start it on a small scale to begin with – by supplying Birch and a few other establishments on the island, and then a couple of months down the line I’ll open it up to online sales.“I have a passion for coffee and it is so much more exciting to be part of the whole process – from sourcing, importing, and now roasting, to then serving the final product.“It creates a much better story, and it is also an ethical way of doing it as we have direct links with the farmers that we are getting the coffee from.”Assessing the season ahead, he added: “It’s a mixed bag of feelings, it is dficult to have complete faith that this is the final lockdown – I think everybody needs to err on the side of caution and respect the rules that are in place.“The added benefit of Skye is that it is rural so there is lots of space for people to socially distance. And, thankfully, with the exception of Home Farm there hasn’t been any major outbreaks – and I think that was because people were being safe and able to be outdoors.“As long as people are following the rules then that’s the best we can do.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3746987.jpg--.jpg?1618485362000\n","title":"martinstown post office temporary closure for modernisation work","story":"Martinstown Post Office will temporarily close for modernisation.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, unlike other parts of the UK, retail and hospitality businesses in the North do not yet know when they can re-open. The Northern Ireland Executive is due to meet on Thursday to discuss their plans in terms of further easing of the current lockdown restrictions. Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts described the resumption of click and collect services as a long overdue and welcome development. googletag.cmd.push “It is a step toward the wider reopening of our high streets and will provide a much-needed leline for many local independent retailers whose businesses are on their last legs. “This Thursdays Executive meeting will be one of the most important ever for thousands of local small business owners. “With over million vaccinations, falling hospital admissions and decreasing new cases of the virus, there is absolutely no reason why the Executive cannot greenlight the safe reopening of non-essential retail, hospitality and close contact services for thApril.” Mr Roberts said his organisation was also concerned that the Executive is not doing enough preparation for the wider reopening of our high streets. googletag.cmd.push “Public hand sanitisers, Covid marshals and agreed Covid compliance signage for businesses, all need to be in place ahead of reopening. “These next few weeks will be make or break for thousands of local small businesses.” Meanwhile, Derry City and Strabane District Council has said that its outdoor sports facilities are now available to be booked following the latest phase of the easing of the lockdown restrictions.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shauna Gill, who is the younger sister of Sister Clare Crockett, will be the first speaker at the retreat at Long Tower church at .pm. She said that while people may be disappointed they cannot attend in person, the event will be fully streamed on the Long Tower Facebook page and webcam, allowing everyone across the city, and across the world to join in. She added: “This is a very special time for the family, and everyone who is devoted to Clare as it marks the fth anniversary of her death. We are delighted to be able to bring this retreat as we remember someone who has touched the lives of so many, both during her le and after her death. googletag.cmd.push “Our family have been inundated with stories from people across the world whose lives have been touched by Clare. “I’ll be opening the retreat on Monday night, and the theme of my talk will be of Clare as a big sister. I’ll be remembering Clare the way she was before she decided to walk the holy path, and went on that journey that has become so famous now. “On Tuesday night Clare’s best friend Sharon Doran will talk about Clare’s teenage years, and her former drama teacher at St Cecilia’s College Greta McTague will be the speaker on Wednesday night. “Thursday night will be a healing service celebrated by Father Michael of Termonbacca, Friday night the talk will be given by Brother Colin, and on Saturday a talk will be given by one of the sisters from the Home of the Mother. The retreat will close on Sunday night with Bishop Donal McKeown. Each evening we have a dferent priest leading the service. googletag.cmd.push “I’d encourage as many people as possible to watch the retreat online. We’d like nothing better than to have the church full, but it’s just not possible. Everything that will take place in the church will be online for everyone to join in with.” Sister Clare, aged just , died on April , , when an earthquake struck the home and school of Servant Sisters of the Mother in Playa Prieta, Ecuador, where Clare had been working for two years helping the poorer children of the region receive a higher standard of education. Her death touched thousands across the world, and especially in her hometown of Derry. Since then a mural has been painted on the gable wall at the junction of Deanery Street and Lecky Road, close to Sr. Clare’s family home, and a monthly Mass has been celebrated in the Carmelite Priory and Retreat Centre in Termonbacca.     The event will be streamed live at http:longtowerchurch.org webcam  and on the Long Tower Facebook page.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dormant accounts are defined as those which have seen no customer-initiated activity for at least  years. Under the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act , money has been released from these unused accounts to the National Lottery Community Fund for distribution to good causes across the UK.

An Gaelaacuteras in Derry, which runs Irish language education,musicand cultural activities, has been awardedpound, to improve their financial resilience by increasing opportunities to generate income. googletag.cmd.push Paacutedraig MacCongaacuteil, Chief Executive of AnGaelaacuteras, said:“We currently receive funding from quite a few funders,but one of our ongoing goals is to become more self-sufficient. We want to be able to provide a valuable community hub and services into the future as we develop our educational, cultural, social and employment opportunities. “In recent years our staff and Board have recognised the value in appointing someone to increase our revenue and help with our sustainability, but we haven’t been able to dedicate the required resources into it. So once the Dormant Accounts Fund opened, we were ready to apply straight away as we already had plans in place and knew what we needed - this just gave us the opportunity to finance it. googletag.cmd.push I’m confident the organisation will be in a stronger position in two years’timeand it should be very clear that the sustainability of the organisation has been increased.” Dormant accounts are UK bank and building society accounts that have been untouched for  or more years, wherecustomers who own the accountscannot betraced. Over pound million is currentlyavailableand money will continue to be released each year to support thelong-termsustainability of the VCSE sector. As part of the first phase,organisationscan apply for up to pound, as part of a flexible and responsive grantprogrammeto help them adapt to future challenges and be more financially resilient.     Kate Beggs, Northern Ireland Director at The National Lottery Community Fund,said: “There has been a lot of interest in Dormant Accounts FundNIand we are delighted to be able to award the first grants. “Weknow many organisations are trying to plan for the long term and thinking about the changes they need to make to become more sustainable. Those changes require leadership, strategic planning, newskillsand strong governance.Those are things for which funding often isn’t available and that’s where the Dormant Accounts Fund comes in. It will provide flexible, multi-year funding and allow a erse range of organisations to plan for a more secure future. “There isalso support for larger investments that will enable collaboration and develop new and creative Northern Ireland-wide or sector-specic approaches to sustainability.” Finance Minister, Conor Murphysaid: “It is great to see the very first initial awards being made from the Dormant Accounts Fund. This funding will support these projects with longer term sustainability and resilience which are at the very core of this Fund. I look forward to further awards being madein the near futureandseeing the positivelonger termimpact the Dormant Account Fund has within the voluntary, community and social enterprise sectors.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Once an application is made to Derry City and Strabane District Council, the council then writes to the residents in the streets to find out their views on the street sign application.

However, because this did not meet the current threshold of %, the proposed new road sign will not be installed. At Hatmore Park,  households were contacted by the council.

The situation with Covid and lockdown highlighted just how important such outdoor physical activity is, to both body and mind.” googletag.cmd.push “Bundoran has become a magnet for those in the surfing world and we can offer a coastline, waves and other water based activities that are on par with many other parts of the world. It is something that will become more important to us in the future. This key investment in south Donegal is long overdue. The Bundoran centre will also be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainable materials such as solar heating  to meet ‘Nearly Zero Energy Building Standards’. The signicant increase in people enjoying outdoor water-based activities such as kayaking, surfing, paddle-boarding and open water swimming is expected to continue to grow year on year, and not just during the summer months.     This means all-weather changing facilities, secure storage and bathrooms at beaches and inland water spots will be in huge demand.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry SDLP councillor John Boyle welcomed the improvements to the roads in the cemetery. “I raised concerns about the condition of some of the roads within the city cemetery a while back, he said. Quite a number of constituents had contacted me about the matter and were worried that their vehicles might be damaged by potholes.

This work will be carried out at the cemetery from Monday April th until Sunday May nd, necessitating a temporary road closure from April th and limited access to the site. I would ask visitors to adhere to the traffic signalling and instruction from contractors. Visitors to the main cemetery area are asked to enter and exit the cemetery through the Creggan gate only.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Film Producer Guy King has spent the past year making the documentary-style feature, called ‘Dferent League- the Derry City Story’, which will premiere tonight on BBC at pm. ‘Bombscares, Benfica and the Brandywell Stadium’ is the story of a community that needed to catch a break and how its football club, exiled from the league for more than a decade, was brought back from the dead. googletag.cmd.push Originally from Glenarm in County Antrim, Mr King moved to Hatmore Park in Derry as a youngster before making his home in London. He was part of the huge ‘Red and White Army that accompanied the Candystripes around Ireland in the mid-to-late ’s. And it was here that his fascination with the Candystripes began. “When I came to Derry I was ten years of age,” he recalled. “The kids on the street had just won the Hatmore Cup playing for Hatmore Harps. And everybody was talking about Owen da Gama and Alex Krstic. They would ask meI was related to Noel King. ‘Who’s Noel King ’ I would say. And I would think to myself ‘Why do they love him so much ’. So in a weird way, I’ve been making this film at the back of my head for more than  years.” googletag.cmd.push  Blaze of colour ‘Dferent League’ tells the background to Derry’s expulsion from the Irish League days and how they burst onto the League of Ireland scene in a blaze of colour, seen through the eyes of several key personnel. Dferent League: The Derry City Story follows the club through those exciting years, managed by distinguished managers such as Noel King and Jim McLaughlin and showcasing a stellar line-up of players from around the globe including the legendary Owen Da Gama and Alex Krstic as well as local heroes such as Paul Carlyle and Liam Coyle. “When I started going to the Derry City matches Owen was in his last season at the club and Noel had already left, so I got to see the Treble but I’d missed the peak ‘carnival’, as it was called,” Guy says.     “I do remember one game, when the visiting manager walked across the Brandywell pitch to the bench wearing a big full- Colombo coat and someone whispered ‘That’s Noel King’ ashe was royalty. So I was always interested in what I’d missed out on, what the ‘carnival’ had been like, and why people were so nostalgic about it. That’s what the first half of the film is about, and then we look at the Jim McLaughlin era up until the Benfica game.”  Imagination to screen Transitioning from imagination to screen was a long time in coming, but it was an idea that Guy could never quite let go of. “I was making a film called Border Country: Ireland Was Divided and during the research period, Derry filmmaker Sean Mullen told me all about the Gang of Four and how they had come up with the idea of Derry City playing football across the border. I thought it was a terric story but that it probably needed a film of its own,” he explained. “I had no ideaanybody was interested. One day I took a long list of ideas into the BBC and the one they were most keen on was my Derry City idea. Probably because they don’t get a whole lot of feel-good ideas out of Northern Ireland, and when you haven’t heard the whole story, it is quite amazing: for Derry to go from having no team for  years and no hope of having a team, to playing in the European Cup at the Brandywell on national television…and this happened in a five-year period. “If you look at the pitching documents we sent to the BBC, they are surprisingly similar to the film that came out the other end. This was our big sell: “A story of four ordinary men defying the system, against all odds. All they wanted was for their city to have a football team again. Their crazy idea changed the city and the country forever.” This is a good description of what you’ll see on Monday night. I’m not sure how much theof Derry City ‘changed the country’, but it certainly had a positive social effect that reached far beyond the walls of the city.” Guy is the first to acknowledge the help he has received locally in bringing his project to reality, with the Derry City story quite fittingly a real team effort. “We made the film in four stages,” Guy continues. “Myself and two producerstalked to as many players and fans as we could in lockdown we had a two-week research trip in July to meet people we filmed in August and then we had a long editing period for the next lock-down. So I’m very grateful for the summer period where Covid when there was almost zero in Derry. We still had to follow all the BBC protocols but we got enough good material when we were able to.”  Memories The documentary-film is sure to take City fans back to an extraordinary time in their club’s history, and revive memories of a unique period for Derry as a whole. “The thing that struck most last summer was that when people say football is spiritual, it can lt you higher – they’re not joking,” Guy continues. “The s Glory Years moved people to their core, it shted mindsets. A Creggan woman told me that she has two distinct compartments in her head: a dark one for memories of the Troubles, and a colourful one for her memories of going to the Derry City matches. “The whole experience had a fundamental impact on that way people saw themselves and how the outside world saw Derry. I loved playing football my whole le, but I never really understood what being a proper football fan was all about. It’s about more than football. I think I can see that now, and I hope people who normally hate football watch the film and see it a bit dferently. ““Here’s a story I love: when things were at their most stressful for Jim McLaughlin before he won the Treble, he carried a poem around in his pocket. The poem was ‘If’ by Rudyard Kipling with lines like this: “If you can dream—and not make dreams your master… If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you.. If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same… You’ll be a Man, my Son!” It’s fantastic to think of him deriving strength from a poem like that when the chips were down.  Never a dull moment As any Derry City fan can attest, there is rarely a dull moment when it comes to Derry City, and right from the off in , the excitement, the drama, and the controversy began. “I’d have loved to include some of the finer details, such as how Jim McLaughlin recommended Noel King for the job of manager in the first place, and then a year later it was Noel suggested Jim come and join him, a decision he famously lived to regret,” Guy says. “At the time, the fall-out between the two men split the city, but history will judge them both to be superheroes. That’s the way I see it. They both dared to dream: Noel thought that along with Jim, they could take Derry to success on the European stage. And Jim was talking about winning the Treble long before they did. “Everyone was thinking big at the time, that’s what made that era special. The sky was the limit. And that’s what the film portrays: by getting to the top of the mountain, Derry saw a new view over the horizon. The team lted morale in a way nothing  could have done at that time in its history.”  Local talent Guy adds: “Of the eight songs with vocals in the film, seven are by Derry artists: Felix Healy , Paddy Nash, Declan McLaughlin, Strength NIA, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Jonny Nutt and the lesser-known Divine Comedy. “A couple of the songs were composed especially for the film: one is ‘Daughter Dear ’ by Jonny Nutt and the other is Strength NIA’s ‘Owen Da Gama’ which is coming out on a record soon. “It was Rory Moore from Strength NIA who first told me about Owen Da Gama because he lived across the street from us when we were kids in Hatmore Park. So there’s nostalgia for you.”  Dferent League: The Derry City Story by State Of Grace and Stray Bear Films, will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland tonight at pm.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kick off :pm. Dundalk have lorded it over the Candystripes in recent years, winning  of  games in all competitions since Ryan McBride inspired Derry to a win over them back in . It has been one-way traffic, but that is a statistic which City will have to changethey are to finally move off the bottom of the Premier Division. Dundalk have not lost a game at the Brandywell since November ,  when they lost -, and over  years has passed since that meeting. googletag.cmd.push Declan Devine’s team ended a run of four success defeats when they drew with Drogheda United at the weekend, but along with Dundalk, they are one of only two teams without a Premier Division victory after five weeks. Both teams are therefore desperate for the win, and with Dundalk in a chaotic state off the pitch – manager Shane Keegan and coaches Filippo Giovagnoli and Guiseppe Rossi have all left the club in recent days – now could be a good time for City to face their great rivals. Declan Devine is paying no attention to the comings and goings at Dundalk however, insisting it does not change the talent they have at their disposal ahead of tomorrow night’s game. googletag.cmd.push “Dundalk have probably got the best squad in the league,” he said. “I was at the game on Saturday and you look at the bench and you have Cherrie, Sloggett, McEleney, Junior and McMillan and they have just signed a guy from America who was in Valencia’s first team. “They have so many quality players, so don’t get caught up in the fact that they have a low points tally and that they are where they are. They were very good for periods against St. Pat’s and they will be coming here and it will be a good game.” Derry City and Dundalk are the only teams in the Premier Division without a win yet, and while the pressure grows with each passing game, the City boss seems content with the progress he feels his team is making.     “It’s a game we have to look forward to,” he said. “A lot of teams are still finding their way and still finding their identity in terms of their patterns of play. We are staying positive. I have seen glimpses in all our games, except Longford, that what we’re trying to do here is going to work. There’s nothing in the league here that scares me. Everybody on their day is capable of winning games in this league. We are getting close. We are giving ourselves a mountain to climb with the goals we concede but we also have to be better in how we penetrate teams at the other end.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours. If itrsquos the latter, ever member of the chamber and everyone across this district will be up for that fight..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Church.jpg","title":"Church delivers huge food donation  ","story":"THE Journey Church in Downpatrick has been working to distribute more than pound, worth of food supplies to ious food banks across the district.Over a seven-week period, dozens of volunteers worked to ensure that food has been delivered to organisations which get the supplies to families and iniduals who need it most.Itrsquos the latest wave of the local effort from Newry, Mourne and Down Council with funding from the Department for Communitiesto get practical help to families economically affected by the pandemic.From March last year, local groups quickly responded to distribute food parcels to any household in need. The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne. Cllrs David Taylor, Gareth Sharvin and Oonagh Hanlon also supported the motion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council directors earn over £100k during past year  ","story":"THREE senior staff members of Newry, Mourne and Down Council received financial packages worth more than pound, last year.The councilrsquos chief executive, Marie Ward, earned pound,, while two council directors, Michael Lipsett and Dorinnia Carville, each took home pound,.The figures, which include pension entitlements and expenses, are included in the Town Hall Rich List , which is produced by the right wing pressure group, the Taxpayersrsquo Alliance.The report reveals that a total of  council staff across Northern Ireland received packages in excess of pound,.Of the council chief executives province-wide, Mrs Ward was the lowest paid.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control.

Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

After the war, he was discharged in  after  yearsrsquo service.Terry revealed that his uncle Andyrsquos brother Albert also joined the RAF and signed up to serve the same day as Killyleagh World war Two veteran Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who sadly passed away recently and flew many missions with Bomber Command.In keeping with the family tradition, another brother of Terryrsquos uncle mdash Horatio, who was known as Rush mdash was a lsquoDesert Ratrsquo serving under Field Marshal Montgomery to defeat the Germans in North Africa, with other family members joining the police and other services at home during the Second World War .In addition, six brothers from the Andrews family left Killyleagh to serve in the first World War with all ing home safe.Terry said he was pleased that politicians from across the political ide had extended their sympathy to the Queen and marked the contribution and dedicated service of Prince Philip.ldquoTributes have poured in from across the globe and have been testament to the calibre and integrity of the man and what he stood for, he continued.ldquoPrince Philip was most certainly a one-off, the likes of which we will never see again. My father described the Prince as the perfect gentleman.ldquoHis sad passing does indeed mark the end of a era Prince Philip was truly unique and I know that from talking to my dad that he enjoyed his visits to Northern Ireland. The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease. He will be very sadly missed, not just by his family, but many others..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Return.jpg","title":"Return to action for soccer teams  ","story":"TWO local clubs are to kickstart theirto football when they take part in an invitational tournament next month.Killyleagh YC and Ballynahinch Olympic are to take part in the month-long tournament hosted by Woodvale FC.The competition is comprised of eight teams which have been separated into two groups.The first games are scheduled for Saturday, May , when Killyleagh face Portadown-based outfit Hanover FC whilst Ballynahinch Olympic compete against Brantwood.The following week sees the derby clash between Killyleagh and Olympic, which each manager will be hoping to use as an earlyindicator for their teamsrsquoto form.Killyleagh YC manager Paul Sharvin said: ldquoWe are looking forward to getting back.

The other was the Duke of Gloucester but he was the only one of that station that I got speaking to.Mr Hanvey said that added to sharing the special day with his family, two special events to mark Remembrance Day added to the poignancy.ldquoA Lancaster bomber came over and ped poppies on the ship and once the ceremony was over a Harrier jump jet hovered along the side of the side facing inwards and did a bow to say goodbye.

The exact date of the picture is unknown but was taken in  or Leading pro-democracy supporters were given jail or suspended jail sentences by Hong Kong courts.These included former legislators and leading members of the pro-democracy movement.Among the nine who were sentenced was -year-old Jimmy Lai the media tycoon and owner of Apple Daily, who was sentenced to fourteen months in prison for unauthorised assembly. \" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMwMjUMDM.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMwMjUMDM.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\"\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"The pro-democracy activist Martin Lee walks after receiving a suspended sentence in Hong Kong last Friday. The court sentenced five pro-democracy advocates, including media tycoon Jimmy Lai, to up to  months in prison for organising a  anti-government march, part of protests that triggered a crackdown from Beijing. He has yet to face six other charges which carry a possible le sentence under the draconian National Security Law introduced by mainland China last year.Others have been given twelve-month sentences. Some of these that have received suspended sentences include Martin Lee QC who is aged  and regarded as the founding father of democracy in Hong Kong and leading barrister Margaret Ng. One of the nine, called ‘Long Hair’, was sentenced to  months in prison.The former Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP John CushnahanThere is nothing left of democracy and human rights in Hong Kong. The much heralded ‘one country, two systems’ no longer exists. The Irish government is morally obliged to use its position on the UN Security Council along with the UK and US governments to protest against the latest destruction of Hong Kong’s one country, two systems. In tandem with this, I belive all Irish MEPs should work together to persuade the European Parliament to reject the EU–China Comprehensive Agreement on China. The wider international community must also act. Moral condemnations of China’s action alone will not change Chinese policy. Their current arrogance stems from their rapid emergence as a global economic power en route to being the world’s largest in the next couple of decades. The only thing that will halt China’s aggression in the South China Sea region is when the international community including EU governments work together to do two things.l Firstly, to impose political and trade sanctions that threatens to undermine China’s role as a global economic power. The suggested expansion by Boris Johnson of the G to D to include Australia, India and South Korea which could happen at that organisations summit in June in Cornwall could provide a vehicle for such actions.l Secondly, by creating military coalitions such as an expanded “Asian Nato” as suggested by the new United States Asia Tsar, Kurt Campbell. It could involve EU members of NATO and would provide a counterweight to China.If the international community fails to act, China’s next target will be Taiwan.• John Cushnahan is a former Alliance Party leader, and Fine Gael MEP.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

This opportunity is in advance of opening the programme to the entire - age group by the end of April. Appointments are mainly available at the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and bookings will be available from pm today. Appointments in community pharmacies will be made available to - year olds later in April as vaccine supplies permit. Health Minister Robin Swann said:“I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by JCVI. I recently announced that we successfully administered over one million vaccines across Northern Ireland to the highest priority groups. This figure is expected to rise exponentially as the Trust vaccine centres and GP practices continue to deliver second doses while the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and the community pharmacists push ahead to deliver first doses. Opening up to - year olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. “I encourage those who are eligible to seize this opportunity and take up the offer of vaccination. Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you. I would also strongly encourage anyone aged  years or over who hasn’t booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible.” In line with recent JCVI advice, those living in the same house with someone who is severely immunosuppressed will also be able to access the programme shortly, once their household has received a letter from their GP. Appointments at this stage are limited and the Department is asking for patience. If you cannot get an appointment immediately keep trying. Appointments will be more widely available by the end of April. If possible, booking should be done online at:https:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated However, where online booking is not possible, the telephone booking number is   .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fadacceafafcff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efdabebbedbfdade   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
