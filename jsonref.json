We used to be able to walk along the footpath where there was just a chain link fence so you could see the lake the laurel trees in their garden.\u0027Now there\u0027s that 7ft high fence blocking our view of the garden, which is outside their boundary and is not at all in keeping with the local area. It\u0027s offensive.\u0027In a letter to the local council, neighbour Laura Lauro wrote: \u0027I strongly object to the fence it is much too high, it has been erected without permission, without consulting the people living in the area very obstructively on the footpath, narrowing it considerably and with no consideration for the historic value of the footpath and completely ignoring the gloomy effect it has on it.\u0027Another resident, Julia Russell, added: \u0027The new fence has blighted the landscape. Most importantly, it narrows and darkens the footpath to such an extent that children and dogs are at risk from cyclists suddenly appearing from around the bend.\u0027In another letter of objection, neighbours known only as Mr and Mrs Aubury wrote: \u0027Whilst we fully understand the applicant\u0027s desire for privacy, the fence as it stands negatively affects the view from our property.              The row centres on a 130ft-long wooden fence (pictured) erected next to a footpath that runs along the side of Burton\u0027s home which ramblers say narrows the path and blocks out light         The wooden fence, erected in September, next to the Thames (pictured) has replaced a chain link fence to keep out prying eyes of walkers using the path and looking into the garden          The new fence at the property was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later and now been granted despite protests by the local council         The grand property (pictured) was once owned by Bonham Carter\u0027s ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, where he lived until his death in 1932 \u0027This fence materially affects the character and appearance of this part of the conservation area. The fence has replaced a previously green meshed wire fence which blended with its surroundings and effectively demarcated the boundary.\u0027While another neighbour added: \u0027I used to be able to walk along the path with my friend side-by-side but now one of us has to walk behind the other.\u0027The path narrows as it bends round and you can find yourself quite close to the banks of the river.\u0027The fence was put up last year to protect the owner\u0027s privacy and prevent walkers using the footpath that runs alongside the house from looking into the garden.It was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later.And despite complaints from ramblers and neighbours to the property planning permission has now been granted.They also conceded that although the new fence had been built in front of the old one and reduced the width of the footpath, there was no legally-recorded width for the path.Case officer Kerry Street said in her report: \u0027Given the distance of the fence to the nearest properties, and the river that separates them, there will be no detrimental harm to these properties through either loss of light, overlooking or over-shadowing.         Bonham Carter 54, and Burton were together for 13 years before they split. The actress is now dating toy boy Rye Dag Holmboe who is 32, pictured looking loved up in London\u0027s Primrose Hill\u0027Given the relatively small change in the position of the fence compared with the previous fence, and relative to the width of the path itself, officers do not consider that safety has been compromised.\u0027Edward Scissorhands filmmaker Burton, 60, bought the Grade II listed home five years after meeting actress Bonham Carter, with whom he has two children.It was on the lawns of the property that her ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, entertained Winston Churchill, Lloyd George and the Aga Khan.And it was on the backwater of the Thames, that Asquith, known as \u0027The Sledgehammer\u0027, found escape from weighty pre-war politics, and where he mourned the death on the Somme of his son, Raymond.Asquith, prime minister from 1908 to 1916 and the leader of the last Liberal government, bought the 18th century Mill House along with neighbouring Wharf Mill, where he lived, in 1912.Asquith so loved the area - his biographer Roy Jenkins said it played a \u0027great part\u0027 in his life - that he chose to die there, and asked to be buried in the churchyard rather than Westminster Abbey.His widow sold the property in 1932. Its owner for 30 years before being sold to Burton, Jane Stevens, served as lady-in-waiting to the late Princess Margaret, who was also a close friend.More recently Johnny Depp is believed to have sought solace there with his friends Bonham Carter and Burton following the bitter fallout from his orce from Amber Heard.Bonham Carter and Burton split in 2014 after 13 years together. But they remain friends and both spend time at their country home with their children Billy, 15, and Nell, 11.During their time together the couple famously lived in London next door to each other in leafy Belsize Park, North London, saying that their relationship was \u0027enhanced by knowing we have our personal space to retreat to\u0027.Burton\u0027s representatives declined to comment when approached by Mail Online.A housekeeper said by neighbours to live at the period property said, \u0027no thank you\u0027 when approached by Mail Online for a comment.Diane Hamshere, who is named on the planning application, also declined to comment when approached by Mail Online. "},{"url":null,"title":"Wigan mother left mortified sending carpet fitters picture sunburnt bottom","story":"Share this article \u0027It\u0027s all over the internet now and everybody\u0027s going to be thinking what a scrubber.

Staff at Heathrow Airport (pictured) became suspicious when they tried to exchange a large amount of money at a currency exchange Detectives then downloaded a series of audio files from Adams’ mobile phone and discovered recordings of incriminating phone calls in which he, Arain and Ahmed discussed their illegal activities.In one such call, in the lead up to the fraud, Arain and Adams discussed whether she had sent him a ‘signature specimen’ - which she confirmed she had - and where the cheque book was.Arain confirmed that she had moved it to his underwear drawer.In another call - just minutes before police stopped Adams at the money exchange bureau - Adams tells Arain ‘find me some watches, find me some gold’.This was a reference to identifying places to spend the laundered money.

Global Radio, which includes Capital, Heart, Classic FM, Smooth, LBC, Gold and numerous local stations, costs £290 million compared with the BBC’s radio output of £655 million.Global lowers costs by sharing news and keeping a lid on presenters’ pay — unlike the BBC, which paid a single radio presenter, Chris Evans, £1.6 million before he defected to Virgin last year.A SOAP OPERA IN WALFORD: £87MEastEnders’s audiences have plummeted from 21 million in 1987 to 6.7 million in 2017. That hasn’t stopped the BBC throwing money at a new set for the soap opera.The site, slated to cost £57 million, was meant to be finished last year. But the National Audit Office says it will cost £87 million — enough to build 1,000 council houses — and won’t be ready until 2021.

Despite this, local taxi firms were quoting an average of just £45.Last year, accounts show the BBC’s chief technical and product officer, Matthew Postgate, spent £6,880 on a return flight from Heathrow to Miami. According to the Skyscanner website, the same journey could be taken next week with Norwegian Airlines direct from Gatwick for just £510 return.A REVAMP FOR THE LONDON HQ: £1BN The BBC spent just over £1 billion on refurbishing Broadcasting House — an overspend of £107 million.

But in 2009 it admitted to sending 415 — a remarkable figure for an event that in 2016 managed a peak viewing audience of less than two million. In 2017, the BBC refused to reveal the cost of its Glastonbury coverage, saying to do so would breach EU human rights laws.THE COST OF GOLDEN HANDSHAKES: £36M Former Deputy Director General Michael Byford was made redundant in an economy drive. But his payoff was as much as some people earn in their entire careers. He got a year’s salary of £474,500, another £474,500 ‘in lieu of notice’ — and even £73,000 for holidays not taken.

The award-winning American playwright and activist who has spent decades campaigning globally against anti-female violence, was ritually assaulted by her father, Arthur Ensler. It began as sexual abuse when she was five. By the time she was 10, he was choking her, punching her in the face, threatening to stab her and beating her with belts and paddles in sickening acts of pain and humiliation. Eve’s mother looked on in silence. Her family was pitted against her. Arthur died 31 years ago he had not uttered any words of repentance.Earlier this month, the TV presenter and comedian, Ellen DeGeneres, spoke of her sexual abuse at the hands of her late stepfather. Her mother apologised for not originally believing her daughter’s story. It was a cathartic #metoo moment. Eve Ensler can be afforded no such moment.So how can the scarred survivor find psychic liberation from her abuser after he has died, when accountability is evaded and a reckoning forever out of reach? Ensler, at the age of 65, grapples with this difficult question in the course of this profound, imaginative and devastating book.Ensler has, before now, touched on the legacy of her abuse. In her 2013 memoir, In the Body of the World, she described feeling exiled from her body and “trying to find a way back”. This is what had led her to document other women’s relationships to their bodies in The Vagina Monologues (1996), her seminal stage play that sparked a worldwide movement to end gendered violence in the creation of V-Day. Some of the women and girls she spoke to – over 200 in total – had also become exiled from their bodies and were “desperate for a way home”, she wrote.This latest memoir returns her to the violated body of her own five-year-old self, and the bloodied and beaten teenager, but through a central paradox at the heart of the narrative: The Apology is written as a letter of penitence from Arthur to her – and she, the writer and daughter, undergoes a creative out-of-body experience to inhabit his voice, body and mind.Dramatically, it is horrifying and mesmerising in equal measure, both in its depth of inquiry and its detail. The letter writing device channels Arthur’s intimate, confessional and not always detestable voice, speaking from the tortuous vacuum of his limbo in afterlife.The chronology traces the roots of his dangerous narcissism to an unhappy childhood and describes, with astonishing pathos, the boy whose lonely life was built on false charm and self-delusion. He had an over-adoring mother, an exacting father, and a bullying brother whose sadism is mirrored in Arthur’s adult attacks on his daughter.The tone shifts when Eve is born and here she conjures his sleazy joy at her birth with such ominous foreshadowing that we fear for tiny Eve, even in her cot: “You were my life force returned. You were the gift of passion made out of my own sperm and flesh … I would lean close and inhale the sweet scent of your baby breath. I would cover you in your little white blanket, and as I wrapped it around your tiny frame I would feel this sensation of falling, falling tumbling into a milky universe that offered a safety and a delight I had never known.”Arthur is both human and monstrous – a dashing ice-cream company salesman from a New York City suburb and a paedophile, an embodiment of toxic masculinity and a fallen Lear (“I cursed you Eve, and cast you from my land”). He is first propped up by mealy-mouthed mitigations of his actions and then, slowly, undone by his guilty betrayal of his most loved daughter: “What is this burning sensation in my chest? Oh Eve, oh Eve, is this your heart inside me? ... Oh anxiety, Oh loneliness, oh despair. Despair.” But in spite of, or perhaps because of, his hyperbolic, theatrical language, his apology, when it comes, retains a hint of self-pity and histrionics.The Apology is a complicated act of ventriloquism and Eve’s anger sometimes glints within his words. At one point, she sounds like a modern-day Circe, vanquishing the spectre of this abusive father by turning him into a small, scuttling creature, her contempt for him forced out of his mouth as self-loathing: “I grow sick of these horrific confessions and myself. Rattling and oinking on and on. Struck like an unctuous pig spinning on a torturous spit of gangrenous self-centredness.”A double-narrative emerges in the course of the book and it is as much her story as his we see her change from a naturally effervescent child to a young woman battling with drink, drugs and suicidal self-destructiveness. His abusive psychopathology is correlated to its damaging effects on her psyche (“You were always apologising, begging for forgiveness. I had reduced you to a daily degrading mantra of ‘I’m sorry.’”).The young Eve emerges as a girl of immense inner steel, a “fierce and unstoppable daughter” in the face of systematic beating and bullying. There are quietly heroic moments of resistance that are both triumphant and tragic for her strength in acute adversity. In one instance, Arthur Ensler creeps into her bedroom to abuse her and is taken aback by her stiff unresponsiveness. She has wilfully vacated her body – the bodily exile that she speaks of years later. It is the only form of protest left to her and it works to repel him.In another instance, he stops beating her bare, bloody bottom when she forces a fake smile, despite the pain, and thanks him for it. He never punishes her in the same way again. Both these moments show Eve’s courageous negotiations of power, even when he presumes to render her powerless.This book, in the end, is an act of imaginative empathy that seeks to understand the monster father and turn him into the human one, and also its own form of literary retribution that calls out his crimes.Can creative exhumation of this kind really free an abused adult from a lifetime of childhood suffering? Ensler’s book does not – cannot – provide a definitive answer but there is a moving power and poetry to the prose that rouses Arthur from his grave and holds him to account. The book ends with the words “Old man, be gone”, and one feels – hopes – he has left his limbo and is in permanent banishment, his daughter at last free.• The Apology is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

As the protagonist of two books inspired by Malik’s adventures on the British Muslim singles scene, Sofia Khan Is Not Obliged and The Other Half of Happiness, Khan’s monologues combined Bridget Jones-ish expostulations – “Oh my actual God. There’s a man in my bed!” – with a dry turn of phrase that suggested covering one’s head can be a fashion as well as a religious statement. “Some people like shopping, some people like therapy, I happen to like praying.”Malik’s first non-Sofia novel takes place in a fictional south coast village named Babbel’s End, where the Muslim population numbers precisely three: mild-mannered accountant Bilal Hasham, his local journalist wife, Mariam, and their teenage son, Haaris. Bilal’s natural instinct to blend in has always been a bit of a disappointment to his mother, whose dying wish is that he grow a beard. This turns out to be the easy part she also instructs him to build a mosque in the middle of the village.It’s an engaging scenario, in which a sleepy parish council instantly fears that the community is about to become a hotbed of fundamentalism. The problem is that Malik’s switch from the urban environment of the Sofia Khan books to a parodic stereotype of an English village results in writing that can become humdrum and flavourless: “Change was meant for fascist states and oppressive governments, not serene, bobbing-along, minding-its-own-business Babbel’s End.”Malik’s great gift is to present seemingly insoluble issues of faith and intolerance in a light, accessible manner. This Green and Pleasant Land is a laudable attempt to extend her range beyond romantic comedy, though the use of omniscient third-person narration can be ungainly at times. Bilal is a decent enough chap, yet Malik relies for internal characterisation on phrases such as “a plethora of questions began to tumble around his aching head” while his wife finds that “life had become a series of taking deep breaths”. Above all, one misses the unrestrained, subversive voice of Sofia a woman who clearly would be capable of shaking up the stultifying complacency of a place like Babbel’s End. What this book really needs is someone not afraid to stand on the village green and shout, as Sofia once did: “Terrorists don’t wear vintage shoes, you ignorant wanker.” • This Green and Pleasant Land is published by Zaffre (RRP £12.99).

But it will also be seen as a riposte to economists supporting no-deal Brexit who argue the manufacturing sector’s importance has diminished and, with agriculture, can be allowed to decline while service industries replace lost employment.Seamus Nevin, the chief economist of the trade body for manufacturers, Make UK, said: “This report is a clarion call for politicians of all parties to update their understanding and recognise the central importance of manufacturing not only to local regions but to the wider UK economy as well.“An increasingly outdated understanding of what modern manufacturing actually is means policymakers have neglected the sector in the misguided belief that services, not manufacturing, is where the future potential for innovation and productivity growth lies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d682d208509a7d55cbd03e0eecaa264679f130ee/0_127_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9281e78c807d3cff4e33c922c0d0aba","title":"this is not a what if story tokyo braces for the earthquake of a century","story":"They call it X Day – a major earthquake striking the heart of the world’s most populous city in the most calamitous event since the second world war. Can hi-tech solutions save Tokyo?by  Daniel Hurst in TokyoEvery day, at 5pm, the gentle melody of the children’s song Yuyake Koyake chimes across the Minato area of Tokyo from a loudspeaker – one of hundreds dotted across schools and parks throughout this megacity of 37 million people.The daily jingle does more than signify the arrival of evening. It is a test for the system that is designed to save Tokyoites from what would be one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human history: an earthquake striking the centre of the most populous city on Earth.The impact would be devastating. According to an official estimate, a magnitude-7.3 quake striking northern Tokyo Bay could kill 9,700 people and injure almost 150,000. There would be an expected peak of 3.39 million evacuees the day after the disaster, with a further 5.2 million stranded, while more than 300,000 buildings could be destroyed by the earthquake itself or the ensuing fires.It would be the most calamitous event to confront Tokyo since the US firebombing of March 1945 that killed 100,000 people and burned down more than 267,000 buildings.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownWhen the magnitude-7.9 Great Kanto earthquake struck beneath Oshima Island, about 62 miles (100km) south of central Tokyo, around lunchtime on 1 September 1923, thousands of buildings collapsed. Fires broke out in homes as cooking stoves overturned, and people who escaped described the aftermath as hell on earth. The combined death and injury toll was officially estimated at 105,000 across Tokyo and the adjacent port city of Yokohama, although some reports said it was far higher.In the chaotic aftermath of the disaster, false rumours about a “Korean revolt” and the alleged poisoning of wells also triggered outbreaks of deadly mob violence against Koreans.Tokyo has come a long way since 1923. If any city is prepared for an earthquake, it is this one. The hi-tech skyscrapers are designed to sway, the parks feature hidden emergency toilets and benches that turn into cooking stoves, and the city has the world’s largest fire brigade, specifically trained to prevent the kind of flash blazes that spread after earthquakes.But the problem with earthquakes is that they undermine the very things you do to prevent them. And with Tokyo now seeing millions of tourists a year, and expecting millions more for the Rugby World Cup this year and the Olympics in 2020, the city is ripe for panic in the event of a disaster.“Japan is world famous for its resilient infrastructure and for its seismic technologies. If you look around the Tokyo skyscrapers it’s incredible how advanced a lot of technology here is, especially seismic resistance – but my concern is preparedness at the community and inidual level,” says Robin Takashi Lewis, a Tokyo-based specialist in disaster preparedness and response.“In the event of a big earthquake here … there would be significant damage to critical infrastructure such as electricity, gas, water,” Lewis says. After a major quake, the Tokyo metropolitan government says it aims to restore power within a week, water supply in a month and gas within two months. “When you have a city this big and your basic lifelines are out, that’s a very significant problem.”Yes, Tokyo has the largest urban firefighting force in the world. “But in the case of the ‘big one’, the Tokyo inland earthquake, the emergency services would be overwhelmed.”Tokyo householders are urged to secure furniture to the wall using L-shaped brackets, and place wedges under unstable cabinets and anti-slip pads to chair and table legs. Tokyoites are also advised to always store extra canned food and bottled water, as well emergency kits with flashlights, a radio, batteries and everyday medications. Shops sell “emergency toilet bags” that can be attached to a standard household toilet when the water supply is cut off. They are well-drilled to take shelter under tables or to hold cushions or pillows over their heads, to ward off falling objects.Millions of people, however, could be travelling on Tokyo’s railway and subway network when the quake hits. The Tokyo  says its infrastructure has been seismically reinforced, and that trains will make an immediate emergency stop in strong shaking it advises passengers to hold tightly to handrails and straps.If that all sounds worryingly matter-of-fact, it might be because Japan is uniquely prone to disasters. Earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons ravage it regularly. The most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, the magnitude-9 disaster off the north-east coast in March 2011, shifted the earth’s axis by up to 25cm and moved the country’s main island, Honshu, 2.4 metres closer to the United States. About 20,000 people lost their lives in the subsequent tsunami, which triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant.Naoshi Hirata, a professor of seismology at the University of Tokyo’s Earthquake Research Institute, says the city is at particular risk because two oceanic plates are pushing up against the area – and because Tokyo lies on the flat Kanto Plain, a geological formation that is easily shaken.The Japanese are used to the concept of natural disasters. Schools and companies commonly hold emergency drills on 1 September, the anniversary of the 1923 quake now known as Disaster Prevention Day. The Tokyo metropolitan government has published a 338-page manual, Let’s Get Prepared, outlining what people should expect from various disasters, and how to reduce their risk.Distributed to 7 million households and produced in multiple languages, it includes a short manga comic strip called Tokyo ‘X’ Day, starring an office worker navigating scenes of destruction: falling objects, derailed trains, crashed vehicles, damaged buildings and mobile network outages. The story concludes with the words: “This is not a ‘what if’ story. In the near future, this story is sure to become reality.”The city is also working to update and improve its infrastructure. Although its international image is one of dizzying modern skyscrapers, experts are worried about the city’s traditional fabric: pockets of close-set, wooden houses where fire could spread quickly.The city also reserves a network of major roads for fire trucks and rescue vehicles. These roads are marked with the sign of a large blue catfish, the Namazu – the giant creature that causes earthquakes in Japanese mythology.The city has chosen 3,000 schools, community centres and other public facilities to operate as evacuation centres in the event of a major disaster, and there are about 1,200 centres for people who need special care.Faced with the prospect of 5.2 million stranded people in a major quake, the Tokyo metropolitan government wants to avoid mass movements of workers returning home and advises people to stay where they are at their workplace or school if possible.Accordingly, business operators are used to keep at least three days’ worth of drinking water, food, and other necessities so that their employees have access to adequate supplies in a disaster. The government has also designated temporary shelters for those people who have nowhere to go, where similar supplies will be available.Meanwhile, more than 50 sites across Tokyo have been designated as disaster prevention parks. In normal times, they’re used for picnics and other leisure activities, and resemble standard parks in every way except for a grid of manholes in a fenced-off area. After a disaster, the manhole covers are removed and special seats and privacy tents are placed over them, turning them into emergency toilets. The park benches, meanwhile, can be converted into cooking stoves. Emergency response would be coordinated from the Tokyo Rinkai Disaster Prevention Park, a 13.2 hectare site to the north-west of Tokyo Bay.Best known are Tokyo’s shake-proof buildings. The epicentre of the 2011 quake was about 230 miles (370km) away from Tokyo, but the city still felt strong, extended shaking, captured in striking footage that showed skyscrapers swaying like trees in a breeze.While alarming to those inside, these buildings were doing exactly what they were designed to do: bend and flex instead of snap.The national building law standards mean there should be “little damage” in a middle-sized earthquake, and that “a building is not to be susceptible to collapse in the event of a major earthquake” of the kind that occurs once in hundreds of years, according to a Tokyo politan government spokesperson.Skyscrapers are both the most advanced and get the greatest scrutiny. Buildings over 60 metres must undergo advanced structural analysis as part of more stringent approval processes. Newer skyscrapers in Tokyo feature a range of anti-seismic devices, including large “dampers” to act as a pendulum and counter the earthquake waves, like shock absorbers. The swaying is aided by rubber pads or fluid-filled bases.The country has also learned from past disasters. In the 1995 Kobe earthquake, most of the collapsed structures had been built before tougher standards were introduced in 1981. Nearly nine in 10 buildings in Tokyo match modern anti-seismic standards, according to a University of Tokyo study.The city also rolled out projects to reduce risks from other natural hazards, such as floods and storm surges. These include floodgates and levees to protect the eastern lowlands, and improved river and ersion channels in the central area. Where Typhoon Kitty in August 1949 caused a storm surge of 3.15 metres and flooded 137,878 houses, Typhoon Lan, in October 2017, caused a storm surge of 2.98 metres – yet not a single house was flooded.One of the most remarkable infrastructure projects is known as G-Cans, a 17-year construction project completed in 2009 at a reported cost of 230 billion yen (£1.7bn). G-Cans involves a series of five silos, each 65 metres high, that can collect excess water to prevent flooding. These silos connect to a 6.5km-long tunnel that allows water to flow into a huge underground storage tank. In the particularly rainy August of 2008, when G-Cans was not yet completed, the system still spared damage to local communities by displacing 11.72m cubic metres of flood water.While the threat of disasters is not a new phenomenon for Japan, the increase in tourism, the steady growth in the number of overseas-born residents, and next year’s Olympic Games pose new challenges because visitors may not be aware of what to do when a quake hits.Masa Takaya, a spokesperson for Tokyo 2020, says all venues will comply with Japan’s strict building standards, but organisers are also considering “how we ensure that spectators will act in a safe manner if a major earthquake were to occur”.“To help deal with any emergencies, we are preparing evacuation plans for each venue, and are considering the offer of multilingual support to facilitate prompt and smooth evacuation,” Takaya says.The city government has deployed multilingual mobile phone apps to help its growing ranks of international residents understand what to do, and Tokyo municipalities have started inviting foreign-born residents to attend hands-on training.Lewis, the disaster preparedness specialist, says that “given the size and the complexity of this city, the government is doing a good job of preparing its citizens” for a big quake. But there are still “gaps and challenges”.“There hasn’t been a big earthquake here for several years, and the general level of preparedness at a household level could be higher,” he says.A lot will come down to the magnitude of the quake and exactly where it strikes. And no matter how prepared Tokyo thinks it might be, it is hard to formally plan for chaos. After the huge earthquake that struck modern, supposedly quake-proof Kobe in 1995, killing 6,434 people and destroying nearly 400,000 buildings – including the elevated Hanshin Expressway, which collapsed – about four in five people requiring rescue were helped by other members of the public rather than the city’s official disaster responders.When X Day finally arrives, it may be the people of Tokyo themselves who will be called upon to save their own city.

Candidates are being judged not by any probability of success in taking the UK out of the EU, but by the ability to comfort fellow Tories that there is life for their party on the other side, once the deed is done.How to get there is a side issue.Boris Johnson is the frontrunner because he is a master of misdirection – the conjuring technique for steering an audience’s eyes away from sleight of hand, deception passed off as magic. The whole “Boris” persona – carefully careless hair and linguistic prestidigitation – is a vaudevillian trick that Johnson plays on British politics, manipulating debate away from his lying incompetence, idleness, philandering self-obsession and intellectual vacuity.Johnson’s only credentials for the leadership are a charismatic energy that makes grassroots Tories feel good, and their belief that this power extends to other voters. It is a nebulous proposition (and an electorally questionable one) unrelated and ill-suited to the job of completing Brexit.But it is also a pitch that Johnson’s rivals struggle to defeat, since none of them has a more credible plan for getting Britain out of the European Union before the 31 October deadline. Their manifestos are all based on the same rhetorical pivot – a gymnastic manoeuvre that launches off from the current intractable situation and lands with a flourish in a place where Brexit has already been “delivered” to a grateful nation. There is a missing middle section in the routine that involves contact with other countries and parliament.This has been the most stubborn, parochial delusion in Tory thinking on Brexit: the belief that it is an internal party matter that solutions can be cooked up on the backbenches and dictated to the EU. In that view, Theresa May’s failing was not her lack of fluency in the language of European interests but her refusal to explain British demands loudly enough at the concessions counter in Brussels.That misperception sabotaged diplomacy during the article 50 negotiations, and is now feeding complacency about a no-deal Brexit. The Tory contenders who claim to be relaxed about that scenario trade in two vast falsehoods. One is that willingness to rip up draft treaties and renege on financial commitments somehow makes a country more credible in international negotiations. The other is that going through with such a threat hastens the day when Britain can sign free-trade deals elsewhere.In reality, the first calls that any prime minister would make within hours of a no-deal Brexit are not to Washington but to Brussels. The topic would not be chlorinated chicken imports but averting a crisis at Dover and patching together ad-hoc legal arrangements to sustain the inward flow of vital goods. The balance of power in that conversation would not be on the British side. That is why some continental politicians are sadly coming round to the idea that no deal might be the only way to jolt UK politics into a clearer-eyed appraisal of the country’s needs regarding European markets, and what that costs.The overwhelming EU preference is to avoid a messy breakdown in cross-Channel relations, but hope of a late realism surge inside the Conservative party is dwindling. Tory members might not mind that the ministerial careers of Johnson or Dominic Raab were marked by self-defeating bombast and ostentatious ignorance, but those who met them in the international arena are less indulgent.“Brexit is dead,” one EU diplomat told me recently. Surprised by the bluntness of this assertion, I countered that it was very much alive. The clarification came back: yes, obviously it could still happen, and on the worst possible terms, but viewed from the outside, intellectually, as a proposition based on the original 2016 arguments for leaving the EU, the debate is over. Not even the most nationalistic parties in other member states contemplate taking Euroscepticism to the lengths taken in Britain.It is true that the candidates to be our next prime minister are struggling to connect the imperative of getting out of the EU with any tangible benefits to follow. Even hardliners whose most cherished prize is a trade deal with the US looked awkward last week during Donald Trump’s visit, when the conversation turned to predatory private sector designs on the NHS. The economic case, once so confident, has shrivelled into a defensive ball: the pain can be minimised. In the very best-case scenario, there is a smooth transition, and the whole process feels benignly pointless, until the downsides become visible.Meanwhile, none of the tax cuts or spending pledges spewing out of the leadership contest would be forbidden under EU rules. Esther McVey, the most radical Eurosceptic in the race, would cut foreign aid and give cash to schools and the police. She doesn’t need permission from Brussels to do that and never did, although it might be trickier in a fiscal emergency caused by the no-deal rupture she is relaxed about pursuing. McVey, like Raab, is prepared to dissolve parliament if it stood in the way.That wild notion is symptomatic of the way Tory mania has mutated, from a belief that Brexit can work wonders, to a state of not really caring what it achieves as long as it is done. Then the search for alternative miracle cures to the nation’s ailments can begin. Deep down, the majority of Conservative MPs know that the whole enterprise is a warehouse full of snake oil. So there is a twisted logic in giving the sales job to Johnson, their most talented charlatan.While Brexit is still the driving force in British politics, it is no longer a living programme for government. The Tories are trapped between pressure to complete it at any cost – a force applied with wrecking relish by Nigel Farage – and some residual understanding that to do it on Farage’s terms would be a surrender to madness. It is the same old Ukip agenda that has harried the Tories for years. Half of the leadership candidates are following it like Norman Bates, bullied by his mother in Hitchcock’s Psycho. They say it is an irresistible force, but it is a kind of sinister, internal derangement. The Brexit they crave, one that unites party and nation without ruin or rancour, is already dead.That might not stop the next prime minister inflicting something called Brexit on the country, but it is getting harder. There is only so long that a government can parade a corpse and ask the public to admire it. Tories can dress it up in different costumes, stick a Boris-style wig on it, spray it with perfume, but the idea itself has started to putrefy. Its complexion has turned sallow.None of the candidates acknowledges it, but there is a peculiar, nasty smell emanating from their contest. It is the project that has defined their party and British government for the last three years, rotting under our noses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea6a0d09e5afc691baaef69f2e0202956600c071/0_352_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7ca60352ca3734d2c3d8607fd20334e","title":"biological clock ticking but having children unaffordable luxury arwa mahdawi","story":"Kids have always been expensive, but insecure housing and jobs markets have made becoming a parent more financially challenging than everForget Rolexes, designer handbags or fancy holidays – the ultimate status symbol these days is a child. Or, more accurately, a bunch of children. (What is the collective noun for children? An ingratitude? A cacophony? An expense?) It seems to have become de rigueur for the rich and famous to have an enormous number of offspring. Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay and Boris Johnson are all part of the Five Kids Club, for example. Madonna has six. Kim Kardashian recently announced a fourth, called Psalm, which she had via a surrogate. Unusual names are another status symbol, of course: if you can name your kids after fruit, cardinal directions or religious verse without worrying they will be beaten up at school, then you are truly rock-star rich.Anyway, I have been thinking about kids (and the cost thereof) a lot recently, because I am now at the age where my biological clock is ticking so loudly that even the neighbours can hear it. It is incredible how much unsolicited advice about your reproductive choices you get from random strangers when you are a woman in your 30s. Even if you are not particularly desperate to procreate, people keep telling you that you should be – that you had better hurry up and have children before it is too late and your value as a woman goes up in smoke.The more I think about the practicalities of having children, the more I am amazed that anyone in the US who isn’t a Kardashian can afford it. Kids cost a fortune everywhere, of course, but they are particularly pricey in the US, where I live, which is the most expensive place in the world to give birth. The Kafkaesque healthcare system means that it is hard to say how much a “typical” delivery costs, but one study in 2013 estimated a routine vaginal birth at $32,093 (about £20,000 at the time). In other words, a bog-standard birth in the US costs more than delivering a royal baby. If you are unlucky enough to have complications, your bill will quickly reach an eye-watering figure. Last year, for example, the  reported on a family who were charged $877,000 for the care of their premature triplets. Even if you have great health insurance, a complicated birth can quickly drive you into debt.Once you have had the kid, things only get more difficult. The US is the only developed country in the world without paid parental leave, while the costs of childcare are astronomical – although Britain gives it a run for its money in the latter regard. Then you have to factor in living somewhere with more than one bedroom when many housing markets are unaffordable. On top of all that, there is the fact that employment is growing more precarious as companies replace full-time employees with contractors.Kids have always been expensive – that is not news – but I am not sure they have ever felt quite so out of reach for people in the middle class. It is no wonder that people are having fewer kids than they would like: children have become a luxury that many of us can no longer afford. While that may be good news for the climate, it is a grim indictment of our society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73c6c87a78cfa36d72a4d91e31a9a281ebae61d/580_131_4270_2562/master/4270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd5d6c7927301b2201f11e4e317d970","title":"kylie jenner party handmaids tail gilead","story":"Celebs can drink their Gilead cocktails. Margaret Atwood’s story remains a pertinent warning about misogyny’s mission creepI felt a small spark of joy yesterday, as I imagined Margaret Atwood’s facial expression when confronted with the news that a member of the Kardashian family – Kylie Jenner – had provoked internet outrage by organising a Handmaid’s Tale-themed party. The novelist is known for taking no prisoners, and the footage, which shows Jenner and her friends squealing as they are confronted with Handmaid-themed costumes and cocktails, lays bare some of the most flagrant stupidity I think I have ever witnessed.Was I particularly offended? Before anyone cries “snowflake”, I was not. But I was astonished at the ignorance and privilege of the women in the video, who will never suffer if Roe v Wade is repealed, abortion is outlawed in the US and women’s bodily autonomy is drastically curtailed. The Handmaid’s Tale is a TV series to them, a piece of pop culture iconography that can be stripped of its context, but even then it is not without its dark connotations. The first series was a brilliant and faithful adaptation of the book, before the next series descended into violence so disturbing and gratuitous, that many women I know stopped watching. Yet the rape and the female genital mutilation and the torture did not preclude this story from being chosen by a young woman as the theme of a glossy celebration ripped of its context and appropriated.What is happening? Is a Handmaid-themed party a case of what the writer and poet Patricia Lockwood identified in her London Review of Books essay about the internet – one of the best depictions ever written of how it feels to be online – as “context collapse”? Or is it something more than that? Like the much shared and now withdrawn “Sexy Handmaid” costume, it’s a form of recuperation, where something transgressive and radical that is challenging to authority is taken and co-opted, defused of its anti-establishment power, and commodified. It happened with punk, with hip-hop, with previous waves of feminism. And in a digital world, this process has accelerated to the point where it has become dizzying.That this is happening to the image of the handmaid is, of course, deeply ironic. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, it has been used at protests all over the world. It has, to a certain extent, become a meme. Its what you might call “virality” is partially linked to its semiographic nature: its association with the subjugation of women can be immediately grasped by any of the millions of people who have read the novel or seen the show. It passes comment on world events with heavy, voiceless irony: no need for a slogan, a treatise, a speech, it’s all there: “under his eye” and “nolite te bastardes carborundorum”.It has proved effective, though some disagree. “An overdone visual relied upon by unimaginative white women,” wrote NUS women’s officer elect Rachel Watters on Monday. Personally, I find the microscopic critical attention placed upon what women wear at protests – whether it’s handmaid’s costumes or pussy hats – deeply suspect. It wasn’t really what the women’s march was about for most of the millions of women who protested. But solidarity is dangerous and must be undermined. Besides, those who have read the novel will understand that the costume goes beyond being a form of effective feminist shorthand.I was a teenager when I read my mother’s old tattered Virago copy of The Handmaid’s Tale for the first time. It gave me nightmares. I had never been presented with the possibility of losing my bodily autonomy before, and to live so long as a woman and not feel that was indeed a privilege (later, when I was attacked, I felt it entirely).Yet the most chilling aspect of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel is not the misogyny, the systematic rape, the loss of bodily agency that comes from the use of enslaved women as baby machines, the physical violence. These crimes are all horrific, and, as Atwood has famously said, have all happened to women in the world, at some point in history.Yet somehow more terrifying is the drip, drip, drip of how American women become subjugated, how the protagonist, the handmaid Offred (literally “Of Fred”, because she is his property) reflects with cool and bitter hindsight on the hints that were there, if you looked hard enough: “Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub you’d be boiled to death before you knew it. There were stories in the newspapers, of course, corpses in ditches or the woods, bludgeoned to death or mutilated, interfered with, as they used to say, but they were about other women, and them who did such things were other men. None of them were men we knew. The newspaper stories were like dreams to us, bad dreams dreamt by others. How awful, we would say, and they were, but they were awful without being believable. They were too melodramatic, they had a dimension that was not the dimension of our lives.”When women started using the powerful image of the handmaid, with her red gown representing her sinful nature, and her white bonnet so she can only look in front, as a form of protest iconography following the election of a misogynist president, conservatives were naturally dismissive of comparisons between America and Gilead. What they didn’t get was that, like the novel, it was a commentary on misogyny’s mission creep. Female protesters weren’t comparing their lot to that of Gilead (though Atwood herself has said that Gilead does not feel that far off these days), just as Offred didn’t start panicking until the religious fundamentalists cut women off from their bank accounts. They were drawing attention to the fact that the bathtub was getting hotter.It is an important point, and one that requires continued repetition. When women across the world watched Brett Kavanaugh confirmed as a supreme court judge, we felt a particularly visceral form of powerlessness. It’s a sick feeling in your stomach, a kind of knowing hypervigilance. Northern Irish women have felt it much longer, and now the women of Alabama will feel it, too. A recuperated handmaid may not be much use in the battle to come, but then again, Atwood’s sequel, The Testaments, is planned for the autumn. It could be that she takes it to another level, adds layers of meaning where TV has fallen short. And as for Jenner, well, you could say that patriarchy got her long ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd5e2c179b6595f89bb2508809092a370ba4abbc/0_126_5336_3201/master/5336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ebe21a5ec464ee64d943a52eae2ce0","title":"prime minister therapy","story":"Who in their right mind would want the job? It is almost certain to end, as Theresa May found, in failure and public execration. To seek to be prime minister today suggests either reckless confidence or an insatiable hunger for power. Perhaps we need a reverse catch-22 in British politics: anyone crazy enough to apply for this post should be disqualified from running.A few years ago, the psychologist Michelle Roya Rad listed the characteristics of good leadership. Among them were fairness and objectivity a desire to serve society rather than just yourself a lack of interest in fame and attention and resistance to the temptation to hide the truth or make impossible promises. Conversely, a paper in the Journal of Public Management and Social Policy has listed the characteristics of leaders with psychopathic, narcissistic or Machiavellian personalities. These include: a tendency to manipulate others a preparedness to lie and deceive to achieve your ends a lack of remorse and sensitivity and a desire for admiration, attention, prestige and status. Which of these lists, do you think, best describes the people vying to lead the Conservative party?In politics, almost everywhere we see what looks like the externalisation of psychic wounds or deficits. Sigmund Freud claimed that “groups take on the personality of the leader”. I think it would be more accurate to say that the private tragedies of powerful people become the public tragedies of those they dominate. For some people, it is easier to command a nation, to send thousands to their deaths in unnecessary wars, to separate children from their families and inflict terrible suffering, than to process their own trauma and pain. What we appear to see in national politics around the world is a playing out in public of deep private distress.This could be a particularly potent force in British politics. The psychotherapist Nick Duffell has written of “wounded leaders”, who were separated from their families in early childhood when they were sent to boarding school. They develop a “survival personality”, learning to cut off their feelings and project a false self, characterised by a public display of competence and self-reliance. Beneath this persona is a profound insecurity, which might generate an insatiable need for power, prestige and attention. The result is a system that “consistently turns out people who appear much more competent than they actually are”.The problem is not confined to these shores. Donald Trump occupies the most powerful seat on Earth, yet still he appears to seethe with envy and resentment. “If President Obama made the deals that I have made,” he claimed this week, “the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible … With me, despite our record-setting economy and all that I have done, no credit!” No amount of wealth or power seems able to satisfy his need for affirmation and assurance.I believe that anyone who wants to stand in a national election should receive a course of psychotherapy. Completing the course should be a qualification for office. This wouldn’t change the behaviour of psychopaths, but it might prevent some people who exercise power from imposing their own deep wounds on others. I’ve had two courses: one influenced by Freud and Donald Winnicott, the other by Paul Gilbert’s compassion-focused approach. I found them both immensely helpful. I believe almost everyone would benefit from such treatment.In designing an effective politics, it could be useful to work backwards: to decide what kind of people we would like to see representing us, then create a system that would bring them to the fore. I want to be represented by people who are thoughtful, self-aware and collaborative. What would a system that elevated such people look like?It would not be a purely representative democracy. This works on the principle of presumed consent: “You elected me three years ago, therefore you are presumed to have consented to the policy I’m about to implement, whether or not I mentioned it at the time.” It rewards the “strong, decisive” leaders who so often lead their nations to catastrophe. A system that tempers representative democracy with participative democracy – citizens’ assemblies, participatory budgeting, the co-creation of public policy – is more likely to reward responsive and considerate politicians. Proportional representation, which prevents governments with minority support from dominating the nation, is another potential safeguard – though no guarantee.In rethinking politics, let us develop systems that encourage kindness, empathy and emotional intelligence. Let us ditch systems that encourage people to hide their pain by dominating others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d6cd9f6e89d14f0a8e1cc3cfbf3d7107690e9e/0_2534_3328_1995/master/3328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8956d09d9247b9075073051e785b1c3","title":"want to be a male ally start by helping clean the house","story":"Liberal men say they want to be equal partners in housework and parenting. But it hasn’t happenedImagine if the dishes stopped getting done. Imagine if no one did the laundry, and it piled up, stained and mildewing in hampers and in piles on the floor. Imagine if no one fed the baby, or changed her, and imagine if no one made dinner. Imagine if no one scheduled grandma’s cardiologist appointment, and no one reminded her of the appointment after it had been scheduled, and if no one drove her to the appointment on the morning she was supposed to go. Imagine if no one vacuumed, or washed the windows, or picked up the various detritus that accumulates around the house.Imagine that this goes on for a week, two weeks, two months. Imagine the domestic fights behind closed bedroom doors. Imagine the wailing infants. Imagine the hunger, and the injuries, and the infections. Imagine the paid work that happens at the shop or at the office that would be delayed, then phoned in, done badly and eventually not done at all.Imagine, that is, if women stopped doing housework. Or rather, imagine if they treated housework the way that many men do: as optional.More than fifty years after second-wave feminists began demanding gender equality in domestic life, there is an increasing amount of evidence that women still do much more housework, eldercare, and childcare than men. The stress and lack of leisure time that this causes not only diminishes women’s quality of life, but also can have negative health effects – including risk of heart disease, cancer, arthritis and diabetes. Feminists have been saying this for years increasingly, empirical data backs them up.Overworked American women are frustrated with this inequality of housework, and increasingly willing to voice that frustration. Most aren’t wealthy women, who can simply outsource this work to other, poorer women – often immigrants or racial minorities – in the form of nannies, housekeepers and maids. More and more, the battle for an equitable distribution of housework is moving out of kitchens and bedrooms and into the public sphere. When the psychologist Darcy Lockman published an opinion piece in the New York Times recently, What ‘Good’ Dads Get Away With, it went viral, and there is a renewed interest in feminist analyses of housework.But a growing awareness among women hasn’t been enough to fix the problem. The thing many people don’t want to acknowledge, and the thing stopping us from making more progress toward housework equality, is the resistance of men. Men remain unwilling to do their fair share of housework and childcare: they are oblivious, willfully ignorant, or pathologically indifferent to the stress and suffering of the women around them.The immediate origins of this conflict go back to the late 1960s, when there was a huge influx of previously non-working women into the workforce. The trend was particularly distinct among the highly visible group of married white women, and it coincided with the rise of a second-wave feminist movement that was more than happy to issue critiques of the gendered inequalities of marriage, domesticity and family life.In this era, housework faced a popular reckoning. Women vocally rejected the patronizing myth that they were fulfilled by a middle-class domestic life consisting of home, husband and children. Feminists critiqued capitalism’s dependence on women’s unwaged domestic labor, also called reproductive labor. They also argued that the different expectations of men’s and women’s housework responsibilities reflected not just a material exploitation, but a cultural attitude that imposes on women a moral imperative to always give their time, attention and energy for the good of others.Two decades later, Arlie Hochschild’s groundbreaking 1989 book The Second Shift provided firm empirical evidence that men did dramatically less housework than women – even when those women worked full time, and even in the households of supposedly enlightened, liberal couples who self-reported equal distribution of housework.In the aftermath of the feminist era, liberal straight men reported that they wanted to be more equal parents and partners, and that they intended to do an equal share of housework – chores, childcare and caring for the elderly. And then, they simply didn’t. When women entered the workforce, they effectively took on second jobs – first working for pay outside the home, and then working for free inside it.The problem has not improved. A new report issued last week by the gender advocacy group Promundo, The State of the World’s Fathers, found that women spend up to 10 times as much time on unpaid domestic work as men. What do men spend those hours doing instead? Leisure activities, such as video games.But housework is a tricky inequality to organize around. It takes place in the privacy of the home, making it difficult for women to see each other doing this work, and to collectively acknowledge the injustice that men do not share equally in the burden. It’s just not a very visible struggle. Housework is also hard to organize around because it is unwaged and often self-managed, and therefore easy to see as less important than women’s waged work and the inequalities they face in the paid workforce, such as sexual harassment, pay inequity and pregnancy discrimination.It is also hard to organize around because women’s disproportionate housework persists because of the refusal of husbands and boyfriends to participate in these activities they just don’t want to do it, and since their wives and girlfriends are doing it for them, they see no reason to. This resistance from men can be a bit of a third rail in feminist conversations around housework: many straight women can be resistant, even hostile, to feminist analyses that draw unflattering conclusions about the men they love. It is difficult, too, to break through mystifying cultural tropes about women, domesticity and marriage that cast this work as done not out of obligation or necessity, but out of love. Combine these, and it can be hard to convince many women that housework should be treated as work at all.Real equality around housework will require something feminism has a bad track record of creating: a change in male behavior. Housework inequality persists because men choose to make it persist. Through willful ignorance, the “you’re-just-better-at-it-babe” patterns of manipulation that feminists call “learned incompetence”, or sheer selfish disregard for what women suffer, men choose not to do housework. They choose not to do the mental work of remembering and following up on the family’s needs, they choose not to care for their own children, they choose not to clean up after themselves. In order to fix this problem, feminists cannot afford to diplomatically ignore the fact that the problem of housework inequality is a problem of men’s volition.Men will have to make better choices. Men will have to develop a greater sense of responsibility and moral feeling toward the women they live with, and they will have to take this sense of responsibility and moral feeling and actually put it to use. Men need to change more diapers and wash more dishes and remember more appointments and comfort more crying children. They need to pick up after themselves and after their kids, and they need to sacrifice some of their leisure time to do it. Men are not likely to do this willingly. But women may be able to compel them to. After all, if a growing number of women become conscious that their housework is work, then a growing number may be willing to contemplate a strike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7fc4ee8910de9ba9cec28c06b337248d1be20e/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f33fb077f60f8a8745cc351bbe516a5 1440w","title":"school asks bbc children in need to cover funding gap","story":"East London primary seeks charity’s help with pastoral care after budget cutsA cash-strapped school has turned to BBC Children in Need for funding to support disadvantaged pupils.The school has been forced to axe its team of two pastoral support workers because of budget constraints. It is also having to cut back on reading support assistants and specialist PE staff.Downshall’s headteacher, Ian Bennett, said: “We are looking to charities to fund the school. I’ve never done it before. To have no pastoral support is awful. To lose two reading support workers is criminal. These children are not going to get the support they need.”A second school in Ilford, Mayespark primary, is reported to have already won a grant from Children in Need to support pupils who have missed out on nurture in their early years. The school’s headteacher, Christine Lamb, told the Ilford Recorder: “Funding from BBC Children in Need allows us to support children at the school further and develop our nurture project.” Lamb was approached for comment.School funding has climbed up the political agenda in recent months, with reports of schools closing early, parents being asked for donations, teachers using their own money to buy basic supplies, and headteachers taking on additional roles including catering, safeguarding and cleaning to save money.A  investigation recently revealed more than 1,000 schools across England had turned to crowdfunding websites and wish lists to raise money, with many appealing for pencils, glue and textbooks.Allan Hickie, a charity and education specialist at the accountancy firm UHY, agreed budgets were increasingly tight and schools were looking at “ever more inventive ways of generating additional income”.Hickie, who works with academies rather than council-maintained schools, said he was aware a number were approaching some of the large grant-giving charities and similar organisations for funding. “The application process is quite time-consuming for some of these, however, which can be prohibitive apart from where large amounts of funding is available,” he said.Education ministers, under pressure from MPs of all political persuasions, have promised school funding will be a priority in the forthcoming spending review. It has now become a key issue in the Conservative leadership election.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “The fact that schools are looking for charitable donations just to pay for the basics should be ringing serious alarm bells for the government. The government must face up to the crisis urgently and release new money from the Treasury for schools and services.”According to Bennett, however, schools are having to try every avenue to raise money. His school has also received support from another charity, the Lions Club. “It’s really worrying,” he said.“We can’t ask our parents for contributions. We have to start looking elsewhere. The trouble is, when you cut back, you have got less time to do these things. That’s why we are looking to the charity sector to fund the school sector.”Many schools in England say they have been forced to cut pastoral support because of the funding crisis, to avoid losing teachers’ jobs. Bennett says pastoral support is vital for many of the children in his school.“The hostels are full of drugs. They are witnessing loud arguments. There’s no security at home. They need a chance to talk about the anxiety that creates,” Bennett said.A spokesperson for Children in Need said: “Schools are able to apply for funding to deliver projects that will make a tangible difference to children and young people who are facing disadvantages. However, we do not provide grants for work which statutory bodies such as schools or local authorities have a duty to fund.“Schools applying for funding must demonstrate how their project will provide additional services that are beyond the state’s responsibility. These projects normally take place outside of school time, before or after school, during lunch or in the holidays, unless there are exceptional circumstances.”Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The funding cuts schools and colleges are suffering is nothing short of a crisis. Headteachers are having to go cap in hand to beg money from wherever they can just to keep their heads above water.”“The education secretary has set out his determination to work with the sector to help schools ensure that every pound is spent as effectively as possible to give children a great education. He has also made clear that as we approach the next spending review, he will back headteachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world-class education.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/525a3dac3d503eecfd061ebfc7ef69db8aca7041/0_0_2829_1697/master/2829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d4a1a988b22f841d1382fcefad6f07","title":"theresa may commits to net zero uk carbon emissions by 2050","story":"UK to put down legislation but Greenpeace warns of impact on developing nationsTheresa May has sought to cement some legacy in the weeks before she steps down as prime minister by enshrining in law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, making Britain the first major economy to do so.The commitment, to be made in an amendment to the Climate Change Act laid in parliament on Wednesday, would make the UK the first member of the G7 group of industrialised nations to legislate for net zero emissions, Downing Street said.Environmental groups welcomed the goal but expressed disappointment that the plan would allow the UK to achieve it in part through international carbon credits, something Greenpeace said would “shift the burden to developing nations”.Last week No 10 dismissed claims from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that such a target would cost £1tn and could thus require spending cuts to public services.With May departing as prime minister next month, as soon as her successor is chosen, she has stepped up efforts on policy areas sidelined by Brexit, including new spending commitments, efforts to tackle modern slavery and the environment.The 2050 target, in an amendment being put down as a statutory instrument, meaning it does not require a vote of MPs, will be one of the most ambitious such goals set by a major polluting nation.France proposed net zero emissions legislation this year, while some smaller countries have gone for dates before 2050, such as Finland (2035) and Norway (2030), though the latter allows the buying of carbon offsets.While the 2050 date was recommended by the UK’s official Committee on Climate Change (CCC), May has rejected its advice on international carbon credits, whereby a country can pay for cuts elsewhere in lieu of domestic emissions. John Gummer, the CCC chair, said last month it was “essential” that such credits were not used.Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said the target was “a big moment for everyone in the climate movement” and a legacy May could be proud of. However, he said the “loopholes” of allowing international carbon credits would need to be unpicked and the target date moved forward.“As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, it is right that the UK is the world’s first major economy to commit to completely end its contribution to climate change, but trying to shift the burden to developing nations through international carbon credits undermines that commitment,” he said. “This type of offsetting has a history of failure and is not, according to the government’s climate advisers, cost-efficient.”May, who will mark the target on Wednesday by meeting science and engineering students, said it was “the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children”.She said: “This country led the world in innovation during the Industrial Revolution, and now we must lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth. Standing by is not an option. Reaching net zero by 2050 is an ambitious target but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations.”The plan was endorsed by the CBI’s head, Carolyn Fairbairn, who said such efforts “can drive UK competitiveness and secure long-term prosperity”.She added: “Some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies, and it is vital that there is cross-government coordination on the policies and regulation needed to deliver a clean future.”Downing Street poured scorn last week on Hammond’s warnings, disclosed in a leaked letter, saying the supposed £1tn figure ignored both the economic benefits of action and the costs of not doing anything.A Treasury source said Hammond fully backed the 2050 net zero target but had pushed for a full costing of the plan to make sure it did not negatively impact on other areas of public spending.May has rushed through the legislation with one eye on her legacy after being effectively forced out of office before doing everything she wanted to in terms of domestic policy.Downing Street sources said implementing the target before she leaves No 10 in a few weeks’ time was extremely important to May. It is understood she also reminded her colleagues in cabinet on Tuesday morning that she wanted them to make sure they did not forget about dealing with the fallout from Grenfell Tower after she leaves office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6da536cdd565f8c521f469573cfae2c2b52845/23_354_5064_3037/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65be04300c98ab6a139e2c608f6e1968","title":"uk accused silently eroding eu pesticide rules brexit laws","story":"Analysis finds changes such as removal of blanket ban on hormone-disrupting chemicalsThe UK has been accused of “silently eroding” key environmental and human health protections in the Brexit-inspired rush to convert thousands of pages of European Union pesticide policy into British law.Despite government claims the process would be little more than a technical exercise, analysis by the University of Sussex’s UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) has uncovered significant departures from EU regulations, including the removal of a blanket ban on hormone-disrupting chemicals, which are known to cause adverse health effects such as cancer, birth defects and immune disorders.The changes could lead to the widespread use in the UK of harmful and carcinogenic pesticides, the researchers warn. But because the laws are being drawn up so quickly and at such a high volume, there has been little scrutiny of the process, said Emily Lydgate, a UKTPO fellow and senior lecturer at the university.“The creation of over 10,000 pages of new legislation, which effectively convert EU law into UK rulebooks, is one of the most intensive and significant efforts that the government has made to prepare for Brexit,” she said.“You’d normally think this would be so significant that it would justify primary legislation but because it’s a conversion, it’s undergone a very minimal parliamentary process.”Ffion Thomas, a master’s student from the sustainability charity the Centre for Alternative Technology who was involved in the analysis, said the devolution of power could spell disaster for trade within the UK.Josie Cohen, the head of policy and campaigns at the Pesticide Action Network UK charity, warned the overall legislative changes could give ministers the power to open the door to further pesticide deregulation and potentially make them vulnerable to lobbying.“Despite the government commitment to uphold UK standards, these legal instruments threaten to eliminate crucial checks and balances and leave us woefully under-resourced to protect human health and environment from pesticides,” she said.“Before EU exit, the government must invest in creating a UK standalone regime which is fit for purpose. Otherwise we will end up with larger quantities of increasingly harmful chemicals being allowed in our food and farms.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We will maintain the robust regulation of pesticides as we leave the EU, prioritising the protection of people and the environment. As always, we will continue to make all decisions on pesticides based on the best scientific evidence, following advice from the independent expert committee on pesticides.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0bff3e4498bc0595299e02f6c06336f94363aca/151_138_1177_706/master/1177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0c1d77a35828a21f145ac94c58c691e","title":"lifting the cup why sports bras are the stars of the summer","story":"Since they were first created in 1977, they have been the unsung champions of the gym kit. Not any more. This season, the sports bra is the most valued playerThe first trainers, rubber-soled shoes that made it possible to play tennis or croquet without damaging a lawn, were created in the 1860s. The sports bra, an item that for many women is just as essential to playing sport, did not exist until 1977. And – as if that gap didn’t say enough about the disparate narratives of male and female sport – that first sports bra was constructed out of two jockstraps stitched together.In 1977, jogging was a new urban fad – the following year, photographs of President Jimmy Carter snapped out for a run would be a media sensation – and Lisa Lindahl, an employee of the University of Vermont, had started running daily. “I loved it, except for the discomfort that my bouncing breasts created,” she recalled. So she and her friend Polly Palmer-Smith, a costume designer, came up with a bra with straps that were thick enough to be tight without digging, and that crossed over at the back so that they wouldn’t fall off the shoulder. The first advert for their “Jogbra” featured a photo of Lindahl and Palmer-Smith in their design, with Lindahl’s home address and phone number given for placing orders.Forty-two years later, the global sports bra market is worth an estimated £5.5bn annually. And yet even in 2019, shopping for a sports bra can serve as a sharp reminder of how unseriously female sport is taken. Soft crop tops that offer no support beyond a centimetre of elastic around the ribcage are sold alongside compression bras, as if they fulfilled the same function. Rather than facilitating physical activity, many so-called sports bras simply look sporty, by dint of wide straps and a high neckline.But perhaps, finally, things are changing. For the first time, this year’s Women’s World Cup teams have a sports bra as part of their official kit. Nike, sponsor of 14 national sides in the tournament including England, has used the seamless, nylon-dex technology of Flyknit trainers to create a Flyknit bra. The focus on the sports bra is one element of the progress being made in women’s football to create kit that is purpose-designed for female athletic excellence, rather than hand-me-down designs, scaled down. The bespoke female kits reflect not just a different physicality, but psychological difference. “Whereas our male players prefer a very fitted, almost tight fit, as it makes them feel like superheroes, our female athletes do not feel the same way,” says the Nike design spokesperson Heather Amuney-Day, so the women’s shirt is designed to sit just free of the body.In the World Cup year, women’s football style, with its punchy colours and casual silhouettes, is becoming an aspirational look in an athleisure marketplace often dominated by the black and beige of brunch-orientated athleisure. Nike’s advertising images show the bra in yellow against black, electric blue with postbox red – the clashing brights of the football field – and while some of the models wear leggings, others are in silky shorts and knee-high socks. “The look of football is strong and free it stands for confidence and pride,” says Amuney-Day. She predicts that “just as we saw the success of the US women’s team in 1999 impact a whole generation of American girls, we are seeing this happen across key cities worldwide today”.Eartha Pond started playing football aged nine. It was about five years later that “over one summer my body developed, and suddenly a sports bra was essential. Sometimes I wore two sports bras, and padding, and bandages, to be comfortable – and if I’d forgotten my bra, there was no way I could participate.” Pond played professionally for Chelsea and Arsenal before becoming a PE teacher, at which point “I really noticed the drop-off in participation among girls. I tried to take the time to find out what the barriers were for them, and sports bras came up time and time again. One girl who was studying PE for GCSE told me that her mum couldn’t afford to get her a sports bra. For other girls, the fact that the sports bra wasn’t on any uniform list meant it was difficult for them to ask for one.”As well as working to persuade brands to back subsidised access to sports bras for teenage girls in need, Pond now campaigns for sports bras to be part of a school kit list. “If you are serious about wanting every pupil to participate in sports, then you need to embed that in the practicalities,” she says. “In a class of 30 kids, eight will leave school obese. This is important.”The practical significance of investing in sports bra development is clear to anyone who has tried to exercise in a bad bra. But there is a cultural significance to the sports bra, too. Here is a garment that honours the female body - honours breasts, no less - in a non-sexual, non-objectified way. When Reebok uses Nasa-inspired technology in its PureMove sports bra and Nike partners with Loughborough University for biomechanical testing of female bodies in motion, it sends a message about how we look at women’s bodies. It marks a step change from the position Victoria’s Secret took on sports bras when it entered the market in 2013 with a product specifically designed to give women cleavage at the gym – “The uniboob problem, where your sports bra makes you look straight across – no one likes that”, the then CEO Sharen Turney said at the time. To Pond, “a sports bra is about reducing movement. As an athlete, it’s in a similar category to a shin pad. I don’t think it should be sexualised.” She makes a link between raising the profile of the sports bra and acknowledging the impact of the menstrual cycle on female athletes. “In the past, we’ve been quite naive – we haven’t talked about female-specific issues in sport.” Were the world to get more comfortable talking about physical issues that affect excellence in female athletics, that might have a positive impact on the world beyond sport.When the American professional footballer Brandi Chastain celebrated scoring the winning penalty in the 1999 Women’s World Cup by taking off her shirt and whipping it over her head, she was criticised for drawing attention away from the tournament and on to her body. A sports bra in plain sight was considered unladylike, or unseemly. Chastain said afterward that she didn’t plan to take her shirt off – “I had zero real thoughtful seconds when that happened,” she told USA Today – but that the image brings her “joy” when she sees it now. A few years ago she framed the bra and hung it on a wall. “I look at it every day because I walk past it in my house,” she said. “I don’t sit there and contemplate it as often as I probably should.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b7c4a52bb6eaf7b1134591cb8ac396b89d1adc/0_47_3018_1811/master/3018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55db7ad59c1ebbcb25775cee60b57ee","title":"what film have you seen multiple times at the cinema","story":"An Avengers superfan claims to have seen Endgame 110 times since it was released – is there a film that kept you coming back?In the six weeks since the release of Avengers: Endgame, Agustin Alanis has proven his superfan credentials, racking up a grand total of 110 viewings – an average of two a day.

His demeanor is calm but slightly serious, as he relays the star-studded stories that have turned him into a major Hollywood figure. He unequivocally states: “Life is about one thing: numbers. Nothing else.”Avant’s quiet but meteoric impact on culture is the subject of the new Netflix documentary The Black Godfather, which traces his influence through the various stars, from Barack Obama to Snoop Dogg, that have been impressed by Avant’s business smarts. The film, which grapples with the idea of legacy and influence, brings into focus a stellar figure too long in the shadows.Despite his belief that numerical value is a key determinant in life, what he has done, according to executive producer and director Reginald Hudlin, is beyond numbers. “We tried to do the math of what he’s done and the opportunities he’s generated – we couldn’t figure it out. It’s too complicated, the number would be too high,” he tells the .Born in South Carolina, Avant grew up extremely poor in a segregated south that had little opportunities to offer black men. He later fled, after a foiled attempt to poison his abusive stepfather, and joined his aunt in New Jersey. There, he started a new life in spectacular fashion, despite only finishing the ninth grade. He got his first chance after working in a lounge in Newark, where he was approached by Joseph G Glaser, who believed he would make a good agent. Through a series of business decisions, his acumen quickly lent itself to music, sports, television, film and even politics despite being the unexpected choice, by all factors.Al Sharpton tells of his first meeting with the magnate: “I was looking for a tall, imposing man. And in those days, everyone was bright, darn-there white, and curly haired. They used to call it ‘good hair’. And this very short, dark skinned brother came in who was very emphatic, you know, like a guy, like an uncle at a reunion.”Though his physical stature is small, his legacy is huge with athletes such as Jim Brown and Hank Aaron, to musicians like Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Bill Withers, to executives like Andre Harrell and David Geffen, to politicians like Andrew Young and Barack Obama, all crediting Avant (affectionately called the Godfather) with providing boosts in their careers.For years, Avant was pestered into writing a book about his experiences. He continuously refused but found the possibility of making a documentary intriguing. He personally selected Hudlin, director of House Party and Marshall, for the project, following a sort of theme of his life: selecting talented black people to partake in the spoils of a glittering world. If WEB DuBois created and cultivated the Talented Tenth, Avant is the curator to Bootstrap Black Hollywood who has gone without his flowers for too long. To Hudlin, a movie about Avant is natural: “Clarence is an important figure in American history … It would be criminal not to celebrate him.”While Avant’s name isn’t instantly synonymous with Hollywood’s household stars, to Hollywood’s elite, Avant is part of the club. In the film, Jim Brown, Hall of Fame footballer and actor, discusses Avant’s quiet takeover: “There were so many question marks at that particular time, racially, and Hollywood has its own power base and here was an African American man in Hollywood that was defying what Hollywood was supposed to be.”Obama says: “One of the things he understands is there are different kinds of power. There’s the power that needs the spotlight but there’s also the power that comes from being behind the scenes.” He himself credits Avant with getting him to a primetime slot for the 2004 Democratic convention for a speech that ultimately increased his political profile.A legacy like Avant’s comes with a certain magnitude, which shows in the spectrum of people who chose to speak on camera about the impact he has had on their lives. Initially, Hudlin thought it would take only a year to make, but it soon swelled due to the scores of major names that Avant mentored. In the end, the director conducted over 75 interviews over the course of three years.“It’s just a vast array of people who he’s touched in so many different fields that we just had to keep going, if we were going to do the story justice,” says Hudlin. According to him, it was really the only huge hurdle they had to tackle during the film-making process. “So many powerful people saying amazing insights. Combing through all that material and figuring out the story was definitely a challenge. A lot of times, I would ask people about the same stories because I wanted to hear all these stories from different perspectives, mainly because some of these stories are so unbelievable you have to hear it from multiple sources to confirm that they’re true.”To Hudlin, Avant epitomizes the eminence of great black historical figures who were crazy enough to dream and even crazier to dare. He hopes the film will inspire.“Telling a story that’s very specific to black culture doesn’t limit its appeal in any way … The nuances and details of black culture and black life are things I know very well so I know I can tell these stories very well and very authentically,” Hudlin says. He resumes: “With black folks who are still struggling with getting the full range of representation, telling our stories with integrity is very important, both for us and for the rest of the world. Showing the full range of our humanity is very important.”It is these cornerstones by which Avant has built his life. “Yeah, I helped a lot of people, but my job, so far as I’m concerned, is to move us forward, period,” explains the music executive, mediator, mentor and political activist in the documentary. It’s as Fresh Prince of Bel-Air creator Benny Medina says in the film: “It’s not even like he’s the bridge. He’s the way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/354036516c1d8f7ce7f72a40a9e76d9cc50148e4/463_75_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf08112182c548b19b3b922f19c1b9b7","title":"hungary wales euro 2020 qualifying match report","story":"Wales would not have wanted the chance to fall to anyone else.

Somehow Wales’ best player contrived to miss, going with his lesser right foot, and scooping a tame effort towards the target which was easily saved. The mistake was to prove fatal. The Hungary midfielder Mate Patkai took advantage to slam home a late winner which leaves Ryan Giggs’s side up against it in their bid to reach next summer’s European Championship finals. Azerbaijan at home in September has become a must-win game.For Bale it continued what has been a miserable end to the season. After falling out of favour at Real Madrid and with his future uncertain, the 29-year-old has looked well off the pace on international duty in the past week and back-to-back defeats have left Wales six points off Hungary at the top of group E. As he flew straight from Budapest to Madrid on Tuesday night, Bale would have known that had he taken his chance it would have been a very different story for him, Giggs, and Wales.“The performance was not good enough, especially in the first half. The tempo was too slow. We were under pressure from a lot of set-pieces, but it was our doing,” Giggs said. “You have to take your chances at this level. If you don’t, this is what happens. Gareth is disappointed like all of us. It’s been difficult for him fitness wise, but he’s been fine around the place.” The manager also allayed suggestions Bale is low on confidence, but that looked to be the case on the field.After Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Croatia in sweltering Osijek, Giggs rightly made changes. There were five in total as Ashley Williams returned as captain and Chris Gunter, Ethan Ampadu, David Brooks and Tom Lawrence came into the starting lineup, too.Slovakia’s 5-1 thrashing of Azerbaijan earlier on had heaped further pressure on Wales to get something from this one. But Hungary looked dangerous from set-pieces and Bale twice headed clear. The soon-to-be £15m Manchester United man Daniel James started as the spearhead of a fluid attack and soon showed exactly what he can do with a slaloming run. It teed up Tom Lawrence, whose shot was saved.Bale was at best quiet in the first half and at worst peripheral. Wales remained vulnerable on the counterattack and from set-pieces in the second half and after the ball was lumped into their box it fell kindly to Dominik Szoboszlai, who fired over in wild fashion.Then came the game’s crucial moment. It was a fine move from Wales. Brooks did brilliantly to send Tom Lawrence away, he delivered from the right, and Bale looked certain to score. Why he went with his right foot only he will know, but the shot was tame. And the team paid the price.After Joe Allen had cleared off the line, Hungary went direct again, the defender James Lawrence could not cope with Adam Szalai, and Patkai ran on to take possession. His finish was powerful and unnerving.It broke Welsh hearts and Giggs looked crestfallen as Hungary missed several late chances to put the game to bed in front of the raucous crowd behind the goal. But Szalai hooked the ball from Bale’s path in the final moments as Wales went for broke, and the Madrid man then had a header saved.“We have got the players to beat teams, but that’s no good if you can’t put the ball in the net,” Giggs said. “We’ve had two tough away games, but we’ve had to ask the players to perform miracles as they were short of match fitness. We need to win every win game now. It’s early days and there are still a lot of points to play for, but we are now relying on other teams to drop points. That will happen.“We have given away soft goals in both games. Again, you can’t do that at this level,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06cb027f1e2d33d72b7e5c9b54ef5a6d78f09234/190_20_3236_1942/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d58b6a4854f8352ab5949ee3e0ecc5be","title":"usa thailand uswnt womens world cup soccer match report","story":"It was clear what kind of match this would be a few seconds before the whistle blew. The US put seven attacking players on the halfway line while just three defenders hung back with the goalkeeper. Once the game started, those seven US players sprinted past the Thailand midfield toward the goal. The game largely continued like that, with proceedings taking place almost exclusively in the Thailand half.The defending World Cup champions were out for blood and intent on running up the biggest score possible. In that sense, the 13-0 final scoreline – a World Cup record - was perhaps not a surprise. Alex Morgan set a mark of her own, her five goals tied the tournament for the most by one player in a single game.“We really just came into the game really wanting to showcase ourselves,” Morgan said after the game. “Every goal matters in this tournament and that’s what we were working on.”It took the Americans 12 minutes to get on the board. Right-back Kelley O’Hara was given space and time to loft a cross to an unmarked Morgan, who easily headed the ball past goalkeeper Sukanya Chor Charoenying. For Thailand, it only got worse from there. Rose Lavelle scored eight minutes later with a low drive that Chor Charoenying got a palm to but could not stop. By the end of the massacre, Lavelle and Samantha Mewis had scored two each, Morgan five, while Carli Lloyd, Lindsey Horan, Megan Rapinoe and Mallory Pugh had one each.For the Americans, who had been asked repeatedly over the past few days for their thoughts on France’s convincing 4-0 opening win over South Korea, Tuesday’s dismantling of Thailand felt like an emphatic response.It was also perhaps a message to their critics. The Americans have had an up-and-down run-in to this World Cup, something Rapinoe openly admitted here in Reims ahead of Tuesday’s match. But the Americans have insisted their preparations have been about leaving no stone unturned in order to peak at the right time.While critics may accuse the Americans of running up the score, the players insisted they showed Thailand respect by continuing to attack. “The way we respect our opponent is we don’t take it lightly,” Julie Ertz said. “We take any opponent we have very seriously. We prepare the same way. We have our scouting reports. We train with intensity. And that’s how we show we’re not going to take any opponent lightly.”O’Hara added: “It is a tournament – goal differential matters. At the end of the day, we can’t feel bad for scoring as many goals as possible in any game you’re playing.”The 13-0 score was USA’s – and, indeed any team’s – largest victory in a World Cup. Before that, a 7-0 win over Chinese Taipei in the first-ever Women’s World Cup in 1991 held the US record.Germany held the previous World Cup record, a 11-0 win against Argentina in 2007. Rapinoe said that, after the match ended, it occurred to her the US may have set a new record. “I was hoping we’d beat Germany,” she said with a laugh. “We always want to have any world record, obviously, and everything we can get over the Germans, we’ll take it.”Morgan’s five goals surely put to rest any fears that the striker was falling out of form, after she had failed to score in USA’s final three warm-up matches before the World Cup. She now has 33 goals in her last 37 games.For Thailand, this lopsided defeat puts their chances of advancing out of the group stage in peril. Third-place teams with the best records will advance and the Thai’s goal difference is now ugly to look at. Sweden and the US are huge favorites to claim the top two spots in the group.This was Thailand’s second time at a Women’s World Cup. They made their debut four years ago and managed a close win over Ivory Coast but got thumped by 4-0 by both Germany and Norway as they went out at the group stage. The US, of course, went on to win that tournament.Up next, the Americans head to Paris where they will take on Chile, who lost to Sweden earlier in the day, on Sunday. Thailand will face Sweden in Nice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/375073d7d15c06baf5598432bd7e4958748befdb/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a80dadf6f059ef535c1c5c63c1c3e5a","title":"international mens football talking points from the weeks action","story":"Nations League positives for Portugal and even England, dismay for David de Gea and Kosovo’s Euro 2020 qualifying joyThe numbed anticlimax of Sunday’s third-place play-off ensured the lingering impression of England’s Nations League campaign was one of deflation, as if any hint of progress over the last year had been a mirage. In truth, it was hard to gauge improvements given the disruptions caused by the Champions League and Europa League finals. There were promising passages in each game and periods when the team rather lost their way. But development could be measured in the impact made by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez, or by Jadon Sancho and Declan Rice in flashes. Another semi-final was lost but a second successive penalty shootout was won. The squad unity that had been a feature at the World Cup was maintained, with an injection of youth offering promise for the future. This all felt more of a useful exercise than the alternative: two Euro 2020 qualifiers against whipping boys. Dominic FifieldDullness in midfield and bluntness in front of goal remain acute problems for the Republic of Ireland. The biggest positive for them during Monday’s grim home win against Gibraltar was the bright display by Callum Robinson, who had been given only two minutes against Denmark on Friday. The Preston winger was regularly dangerous and formed a good relationship on the right with Séamus Coleman. So it was puzzling when Robinson, and not the way-out-of-form Jeff Hendrick or James McClean, was substituted after 73 minutes. But when Robinson’s replacement, Robbie Brady, scored a late goal from an exquisite cross by McClean, McCarthy could claim vindication. Brady and McClean will need to reproduce moments like that with much more regularity to justify being chosen ahead of Robinson and Callum O’Dowda. Ireland top their group but the most difficult assignments are ahead. Paul DoyleIf the Netherlands’ players looked tired in Porto on Sunday night, maybe it’s because they were. The Dutch had a day less to prepare. They couldn’t find the edge to chase down a fine Portugal team. But something is stirring here, to the extent the Netherlands already look a decent prospect to resume their status as bright but brittle outsiders before Qatar 2022. Another good thing about international football: other countries can’t sign all your best players. So the Ajax spine will remain even as it ceases to be an Ajax spine. Frenkie de Jong will be in his luminous pomp come the next World Cup. Ryan Babel may or my not be a better option than Donny van de Beek (he’s not), but Ronald Koeman has a wave of young attacking talent simmering away. Europe needs a strong Netherlands. The Dutch have so often been the masters off good habits and beautiful football that falls decoratively short at the last. Some more of the same can only be a good thing. Barney RonayIt raised a few eyebrows when the FA announced England will host Kosovo at St Mary’s, rather than Wembley, in September. Were Bernard Challandes’ fledgling side really not that much of a draw? No one with an ounce of knowledge will underestimate them on the pitch: Monday’s 3-2 win in Bulgaria, sealed by Elbasan Rashani’s 92nd-minute header amid wild celebrations, brought up 14 games unbeaten. As a minimum, Kosovo should fight the Czech Republic for second place in Group A. Challandes’ team are scintillating in possession and won in Sofia despite missing the injured Arber Zeneli, one of their two top-class wingers the other, Milot Rashica, came up with a goal and an assist. They might not fill Wembley just yet but it is hard to think of a more crowd-pleasing international team in Europe at the moment. Nick AmesChampions of Europe and now Nations League winners. What next for Fernando Santos and his Portugal side? . Cristiano Ronaldo will be 35 by the time they attempt to defend the European Championship next summer but is showing no signs of losing his knack for goals as, with 88, he closes in on a century for his country. There is an exciting new generation, with Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes and Gonçalo Guedes – scorer of the winner against the Netherlands. The defender Rúben Dias, who has been linked with a move from Benfica to Real Madrid, has provided some new blood at the back, while the teenage forward João Félix looks capable of forcing his way into the starting lineup over the next 12 months. Santos himself, 64, has embraced the challenge of rebuilding a winning team. “We have lots of talent,” the wily coach said this week. “The future is guaranteed, but we have to try and find the balance.” Ed Aarons“In front of the goal all I could think of was to get it right,” said Brazil’s David Neres. “I looked at the middle of the box to see if there was anyone free. There wasn’t, so I did it myself.” It’s that kind of decision-making that has won the Ajax forward so many admirers and his first senior international goal in Sunday’s 7-0 demolition of Honduras was definitely one to remember. Spotting the smallest of gaps at the near post, an impudent flick with his left foot took everyone by surprise as Neres wheeled away in celebration. He is expected to fill the Neymar-shaped void when Brazil begin their Copa América campaign against Bolivia in São Paulo on Saturday despite having only three caps. Neres has been linked with Chelsea this summer, although that would depend on their transfer ban being lifted. A few more goals like Sunday’s will see plenty of others knocking on Ajax’s door. EA“I get the feeling that people in Spain don’t watch a lot of foreign football,” said the country’s acting coach, Robert Moreno. If they did, he insisted, they would not have been surprised at the inclusion of Kepa Arrizabalaga ahead of David de Gea. Luis Enrique, the coach missing at present for family reasons, has used 43 players in 10 matches in charge, many only fleetingly, and this get-together brought more changes: Santi Cazorla, Fabián, and Dani Parejo, all of whom might anticipate more opportunities. Kepa starting was perhaps the most striking shift. If inclusion against the Faroe Islands might not have meant much, when the Chelsea keeper was named in the team that beat Sweden 3-0, it suggested a more permanent change – this was his third start in a row. “I can understand David being sad,” Kepa said. “I am working the way I did at my club to keep the coach’s trust.” Sid LoweIt should have been a minimum requirement for Alex McLeish to top a Nations League section that also included Israel and Albania. That Scotland did, just about, wasn’t enough to save McLeish’s job but is significant in context of his successor. Steve Clarke cannot say it, but Scotland’s best hope of a Euro 2020 berth still lies in the Nations League route. That was always likely to be the case, bar a miracle in Brussels that wasn’t forthcoming. In his defence, and owing partly to the Scottish FA’s dallying when replacing McLeish, Clarke didn’t have nearly enough time to plot a possible upset of the imperious Belgians. The flow of the match and outcome were pretty familiar. With Russia and Belgium formidable in Group I and Scotland’s debacle in Kazakhstan leaving them fourth in the section, the coming months must be used by Clarke to formulate a plan aimed at confirming a Euros place via the back door. Finland plus Norway or Serbia shouldn’t be overly treacherous opposition, given Clarke’s organisational and motivational skills. He must keep public interest in Group I alive when a more meaningful set of matches follow. Ewan MurrayTurkey suffered their first defeat of the Senol Gunes era, losing 2-1 in Iceland. They had won all five previous games under Gunes, including a shock victory over France last Saturday, but Gylfi Sigurdsson put his side ahead on 21 minutes, doubled his tally soon after and Iceland could easily have scored more before half-time against opponents who looked jaded, unprepared and devoid of a game plan. Although Turkey pulled a goal back before the interval through a Dorukhan Tokoz looping header, it was not enough. Gunes was missing several key players, including Cengiz Under, Okay Yokuslu, Cenk Tosun and Mahmut Tekdemir, but the team looked a shadow of the side that beat Les Bleus. It is starting to look like a three-horse race in Group H, with France, Turkey and Iceland tied on nine points after four games.

Both my children work, so I am on my own all day. I have very poor balance thus cannot walk, and I no longer drive, so the TV is company for me. My hearing is poor so I cannot rely upon the radio. The combination of pictures and sound keep me in touch with what is going on in the world. When I began drawing my pension 33 years ago, I thought I had plenty. Over time my pension has not kept pace with inflation, so I have to be particularly frugal. I would probably have to say no to purchasing a TV licence. Evelyn, 98, WokingHaving reached the age of 75 last year it now looks like the benefit I derive from the free licence will be short-lived. Given the choices available to the BBC I think they have gone for a pragmatic least worst option. The real culprit here is the Tory government after its decision to load the BBC with the cost of the benefit created by Gordon Brown as one element in a government budget package intended to help those less able to provide for themselves.  is right to highlight the fact that while the government-initiated removal of the free TV licence is now going ahead, Boris Johnson is promising an increase in the higher-rate tax threshold to £80,000. You couldn’t make it up. Robert, 76, BuckinghamshireMy wife is old enough for us not to pay the licence fee but in June 2020 we will have to start paying. I believe this is the right decision for us as we can well afford to pay the fee as we both have index-linked pensions. It makes sense that only pensioners on pension credit should receive the benefit but I feel sorry for those pensioners whose income only just exceeds the pension credit limit and those who are entitled to pension credit but do not claim it. Every effort should be made to encourage those who are entitled to claim pension credit. Tom Misselbrook, 70, HerefordshireOf 37 countries surveyed in a 2017 OECD review it was reported that Britain was at the very bottom of the state pension league table. Pensioners, many of whom live in isolation, rely on television as their only contact with the outside world. Free TV licences for the over-75s must be retained as one part of a caring and compassionate social system. George Osborne’s decision to make the BBC responsible for what should clearly be a responsibility of government was, and remains, totally unjustifiable. The government must be made to accept that it cannot subcontract its social policies. Haydn Richard Watkins, 82, HampshireI am single, living on a fixed personal pension. This charge if introduced suddenly will only just be covered by the increase in my statutory state pension. Whilst accepting that the money has to come from somewhere, I do feel that the government has welshed on the original deal and at best should phase it in over a five-year period. James Underwood, 81, WiltshireI’m disgusted, to say the least, as the BBC programming is so much repeats that I rarely watch the BBC channels but I will still have to pay for licence. I like watching sport but the BBC is getting less coverage of sporting occasions, especially rugby. I am an 81-year-old widow, living alone. I live in a development of flats with neighbours of a similar age, and many residents are unable to go out, so TV is a lifeline. Those of us who have saved for our retirement are again being made to lose out.

Older Britons overwhelmingly voted Conservative at the last general election and are overrepresented among the Tory members who will chose the next prime minister.Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, said on Tuesday she would honour the commitment to protect the subsidy.“I think that’s unacceptable. It’s a commitment in the Conservatives’ manifesto and we need to find a way to reverse that.”Aides to Javid told the  the home secretary would also seek to ensure the subsidy continued. “If elected prime minister, he would absolutely work with the BBC to find a way to deliver the manifesto commitment,” he said.However, neither gave any details on how the cost of providing the free licences would be met, suggesting it could involve loading the cost on to the BBC during a future funding agreement.McVey said on Monday: “As someone who used to work for the BBC I am ashamed of them for this decision. Our ‘public service broadcaster’ who has forgotten the public they are supposed to serve.”She added: “My aim is to make sure that the BBC do not benefit financially from breaking their promise and I would want to do everything we can to ensure that all over-75s get the free TV licences they deserve.”Free licence fees for the over-75s were brought in by Gordon Brown in 1999, with the cost paid for out of taxation central government. In 2015, the chancellor, George Osborne, struck a deal with the BBC in which the broadcaster shouldered the cost itself, later transferring responsibility for the politically toxic decision on who should receive the benefit to the broadcaster.The BBC has said it would face “unprecedented closures” if it did not make the changes and pointed out that many elderly iniduals were much wealthier than when the benefit was introduced. About 3m households will have to start paying the licence fee on pain of prosecution.Conservative MPs expressed their dissent in the Commons on Tuesday, after Labour’s Tom Watson put forward an urgent question on the matter.The shadow culture secretary pointed out that more than 4,000 elderly iniduals would lose the benefit in Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency, suggesting he “wants to give a tax cut to the very richest, but he will not lift a finger to defend pensioners”.The Conservative MP William Wragg said the Tories had been “quite categoric” about protecting free licences in their manifesto.Labour’s Yvette Cooper accused him of “careering round the country” promising tax cuts for the wealthy while taking from vulnerable pensioners, adding: “On what planet is that fair?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/920a3a234d5d5bc8ff4362d2f4ca0366bc79ff14/1012_893_3532_2118/master/3532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf910137233815ff0e0dfd932b46d82","title":"saga gas service boiler axa","story":"I’m 70, with chronic asthma. For the last while, I’ve been living in a semi-rural area with no central heating, no hot water and no cooking facilities. This is rather trying.I have an old back boiler which has only needed one repair in 30 years. The gas fire, which stands in front, has never failed. To support this impeccable behaviour, they have had an annual service from British Gas. As, however, the renewal rate rose, I’ve just switched to Saga which outsources to Axa. Their service technician tested both for emissions. He struggled to dismantle the fire and concluded all was in order. However, half an hour later he said he was shutting off my gas because of a hole through which fumes could leak. I noticed a gap on the boiler flue hood had been raised slightly as though he’d attempted to lever it up. Saga insisted it had nothing to do with them. Axa said it would investigate and made a verbal offer to reimburse me for three nights in a B\u0026ampB. However, it says the investigation may take 40 working days during which I would be without gas. British Gas is sending a copy of its last service report from 2017. It says there was no evidence of a hole. VC, Luddenden Foot, West YorkshireYour ordeal turned into a 10-month saga. After the Observer intervened things started moving at a speed as glacial as your home. Axa permitted you to summon a British Gas technician who suggested someone might have tried to move the hood. Since your boiler is obsolete and parts can’t be found, you faced having to replace it. This would have meant demolishing your fireplace and the flue, and knocking through walls. Axa initially offered £250.For six weeks you had to cook and shower at friends’ homes and you say your health deteriorated. Then an independent technician was sent – by Axa, at your behest – who decided the gap in the flue hood was immaterial and there had been no reason to disconnect the gas, which he reinstated.Saga, which acknowledges its investigation only began after my contact, sent a bouquet and hamper.Axa eventually increased its offer to £600 to compensate for the 42 days you were without gas, which you declined because it does not address the financial, physical and emotional costs.It then appeared the seal on the gas fire, which heats your kitchendining room, was damaged when it was dismantled for the service, so it couldn’t be reconnected. It would cost £750 plus installation for a replacement compatible with your old boiler. Four months after your initial complaint, Saga promised £1,000 towards a new fire, until a British Gas technician judged your old one could be safely reconnected temporarily, whereupon it withdrew the offer.You took your case to the ombudsman, who ruled you are due £800 compensation. Saga says: “We are very disappointed with the service VC received … while Axa is required to handle complaints relating to claims, we should have stepped in sooner.”Axa says it is investigating the complaint and is looking to resolve the situation “as quickly as possible”.• If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

This may not be possible in the near term owing to delays in the parliamentary programme, it said.About half of the food consumed in the UK is produced in the EU and other countries.The FSA spent £6.2m of its budget on EU exit preparations across 201718 and 201819 and received £15m of additional EU exit funding.The NAO said it had not seen any evidence of joined-up strategic thinking within government about the level of funding needed for a sustainable system to protect UK consumers from future food risks, or about how much local authorities and businesses should contribute.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “The regulatory system is showing signs of strain with fewer food control staff in local authorities and delays in the checks they carry out on food businesses. This is at a time when the regulatory system faces increased challenges, particularly as we move towards new trading relationships after the UK leaves the EU.”They said cuts to food hygiene and standards staff had led to some local authorities failing to meet their legal responsibilities to ensure businesses complied with the law. Less than half the food standards checks that were due between 2012 and 2018 to ensure products were as described took place.Nevertheless, the NAO said most food businesses were meeting hygiene requirements and levels of major foodborne illnesses were broadly stable.Around 1 million people in the UK have an illness from food each year, potentially costing £1bn in loss of earnings, hospital admissions and the impact on inidual wellbeing.Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The FSA must take urgent action, including to address the gaps in its ability to assess compliance with food safety standards and to ensure preparedness for different scenarios following Brexit.”The FSA’s chief executive, Jason Feeney, said: “We will work very closely with other parts of government to determine the level of government funding required to ensure food safety and standards and post-EU exit will evaluate with other government departments the medium- and longer-term impacts on the food regulation system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

Stiffening can also occur as calcium becomes deposited in fatty plaques in the arteries – a condition called atherosclerosis.The mechanism that causes the calcium to be deposited has been difficult to unpick, but now scientists say they have the answer: it is triggered by a molecule, called poly(ADP-Ribose) or PAR, that is produced when the cells, or the DNA inside them, are damaged.That, they say, makes sense: ageing, high blood pressure, smoking and fatty plaques are risk factors for stiffening of the arteries, and are linked to damage to cells, or even their DNA.The team say the new discovery could prove important for patients.Writing in the journal Cell Reports, the team describe a series of experiments involving bone-forming tissues from sheep and blood vessel cells from cows, as well as human arteries.The results reveal that where PAR is found in high levels outside cells, calcium deposits are also found. What’s more, these areas were found to be rich in markers of cell death, or cells with DNA damage.They also found PAR binds to calcium, as well as to certain proteins found between cells in the walls of arteries and bone-forming tissues.As a result, the team propose that PAR, which has previously been linked to DNA repair and cell death, plays a key role not only in bone formation but in hardening of the arteries. Crucially, further experiments, including in rats, showed that if an enzyme involved in producing PAR is blocked, calcium is no longer deposited in arteries even when DNA is damaged. They also found an existing antibiotic used for acne, called minocycline, can do the job.“People have been studying this for decades and this is the first potential therapy ever,” said Prof Melinda Duer, co-author of the study from the University of Cambridge.However, the team say that while it offers hope that artery stiffening might be prevented in some at-risk groups, questions remain.Duer stressed that iniduals should continue to avoid lifestyles habits that can contribute to artery stiffening, including smoking and poor diets. Shanahan agreed. “What we don’t know is whether it is going to work on people who have already got a lot of calcification,” she said. Paul Evans, professor of cardiovascular science at the University of Sheffield, said drugs such as minocycline that switch off PAR production might one day help patients with arterial disease.“There is considerable interest in the development of PAR inhibitors for cancer and other diseases,” he said. “It is possible that some of these medicines could benefit patients with cardiovascular disease by lessening the symptoms of angina and by reducing the likelihood of heart attack or stroke”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6030369627dc501155c5ffbbf5f48f59b0b0c1b/0_192_3522_2113/master/3522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d7c8a1964b1d9b4c238fab5ab3cdc33","title":"lovelorn fish have gloomier outlook study finds","story":"Female cichlids who lose their mates are measurably more pessimistic, researchers sayInferring the mood of a fish has never been a precise science, but researchers claim at least one species responds the way humans do when separated from their other half. They say central American convict cichlids become glum when they split up.Scientists at the University of Burgundy in Dijon believe they are the first to reveal the emotional attachments that fish form with their partners. Using a cognitive test, they found that female cichlids who lost their mates took a gloomier view of the world and were measurably more pessimistic.“Emotional attachment to a partner is not a unique property of our species, since it has also evolved in at least one other species,” said François-Xavier Dechaume-Moncharmont, a senior author of the study. “It could indicate that these emotional biases are more than biases. Love is maybe not so irrational.”Before assessing the emotional potential of the fish, the researchers investigated whether females were choosy about their sexual partners. The tests took place in a tank ided by clear partitions into three compartments. One by one, females were put in the middle compartment and single males were put in each of the side compartments.Most of the females expressed a preference by cosying up, as much as the iding walls allowed, to one or other of their male neighbours. The choice seemed to affect their fertility. When females were partnered with their chosen male, they spawned faster, spent more time attending to their eggs and had more fry than when they were partnered up with the rejected male.For the next part of the study, female cichlids were trained to collect food from small containers placed in the fish tank. The containers either had black lids and were empty or had white lids and had food inside. The fish flipped the lids off by either sucking or pushing them and gradually learned which ones bore food.Chloé Laubu, a behavioural ecologist and the first author of the study, then confused the fish by adding containers with grey lids to the tank. The scientists reasoned that, faced with ambiguity, optimistic fish would flip the grey lids off in the expectation of finding a treat, while pessimistic fish would hesitate or perhaps not even bother. “A good analogy would be the way you perceive the glass either half-full or half-empty according to your mood,” said Laubu.Writing in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the scientists describe how females flipped the grey lids off faster when their chosen mate was around than when the rejected male was on the scene. The findings suggest that being with the wrong male leads to a “pessimistic bias” in female members of the finny tribe. In other words, lovelorn fish have a gloomier outlook.The scientists write: “Even if human relationships are particularly complex and refined, there is no reason to deny a priori the existence of emotional attachment to a partner in non-human species.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee631808f1872d06b6bb620f375da2a0b0000e98/0_90_3874_2325/master/3874.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa25ba1493a7ea2a044b40e93010f908","title":"tiger woods 10 years jack nicklaus major record us open 2019 pebble beach","story":"• Woods reckons he has 40 majors left to top Nicklaus• Brooks Koepka miffed at perceived lack of respect from FoxTiger Woods has set himself a target of a decade more at the top level as he looks to overhaul the majors record of 18 held by Jack Nicklaus. After years of physical turmoil this may be regarded by some as a bold aspiration yet Woods defied all odds to win a 15th major, at Augusta National, in April. Since that juncture, all bets have been off.In a break from his preparations at Pebble Beach, where he will attempt to win a fourth US Open starting on Thursday, Woods was asked to what extent Nicklaus’s total features as motivation. The 43-year-old took a deliberately broad approach to answering.“If I keep progressing how I am physically and how I’m getting better and better, I just need to give myself chances,” he said. “Hypothetically, let’s say I give myself 10 years. That’s 40 major championships. That’s a lot of majors.“And now the trick is, can I keep myself healthy enough and strong enough and fast enough to endure all that, considering what my body has gone through. That’s where I need help with all my trainers, physios, my workout regimes, and hopefully I can make that happen.”Woods had earlier played down the sense that winning 18 majors or more features most in his competitive outlook. “What’s important to me is that I’m back playing again,” he said. “This game was taken away from me for a few years. And I miss competing, I miss playing.“Now I have an opportunity to do that again and also to be able to share it with my kids. They don’t remember me enjoying golf, because all they remember is Daddy on the ground in pain.“Now, golf brings me so much joy, they’re able to see that. And if it brings a smile to their faces, it brings a smile to my own.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsWoods was clearly short of fitness and energy en route to missing the cut at last month’s US PGA Championship at Bethpage. While unwilling to specify the nature of the affliction, he admitted he was “in rough shape”.The same fate, many fear, will befall Pebble Beach this week. The US Open’s organisers have been widely criticised in recent years for course setup. Woods hinted at such concerns once more at a venue where he won by 15 shots in 2000. He will not yet fully endorse the strategy deployed by the United States Golf Association.“The greens are all slanted, very small targets,” Woods said. “And if they ever firm up then we have a totally different ballgame.“This week I feel like I’m trending in the right direction. I need one more day of prep. I want to see the course when it’s a little bit closer to game time. I know they’re holding it back but I just want to see how much are they going to let it go and show us how it’s going to be come Thursday.”With that inevitable change of backdrop in mind, Woods opted for a driving range and putting session on the California coast on Tuesday rather than playing practice holes. “I did the same thing at Augusta,” he said. “I am just trying to save my energy. It is more important for me to feel energised than it is to go out there and get wear and tear.”Brooks Koepka, who took a second consecutive US PGA title last month and is seeking a third US Open win in a row, has aimed a broadside at the tournament’s host broadcaster for what he perceives as a lack of respect.“A bunch of people on Twitter tagged me in it, in the promo, and I guess were amazed that I wasn’t in it. I just clicked on the link and saw it and watched it. I was just kind of shocked.“They’ve had over a year to kind of put it out. So I don’t know. Somebody probably got fired over it or should.” A laugh – just about – followed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf438e177fabdc1136c6762a3ed1d4013d398df/0_299_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4d9ed5d1094df8219db34e06cac90a5","title":"australia v pakistan cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"Weather update: Good news! It’s dry in Taunton! Well, dry-ish, dry enough, and the forecast is cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the day. There is some rain around the West Country, especially later on, so we may have the occasional interruption for a passing shower. Even so, we should comfortably have enough time to avoid a washout, even if we don’t see 100 overs.As much as the lack of rain is cause for celebration it remains unpleasantly chilly. Definitely a long sleeve jumper day, possibly with a sleeveless underneath and some pocket warmers.Hello everybody and thanks for tuning in to live OBO coverage of match 17 of the 2019 Cricket World Cup between Australia and Pakistan from Taunton.That opening line may read unambiguously like a cricket match will take place in Somerset today but with the weather that’s been hanging around the past few days that’s not something we can take for granted. We’re still an hour out from the scheduled start of play and the forecast is not too bad so after consecutive washouts we should hopefully enjoy a positive result.For the tournament’s sake let’s hope so because this is a fixture with plenty riding on it. Both countries remain in the hunt for semi-final spots but defeat for Pakistan would significantly dent their chances of progression, while Australia will want to avoid being dragged into a qualification dogfight after suffering their first defeat of the group phase on Sunday. That pretty lacklustre showing against India was great for the I-told-you-soer’s. Almost all of the potential weaknesses of Australia’s selection and strategy were exposed at the Oval, including - but not limited to - the depth of the attack, the reluctance to play Nathan Lyon, and the positioning of Usman Khawaja and Glenn Maxwell in the batting order. Throw in David Warner’s uncharacteristic Chris Tavaré impression and Australia have a few issues to work through.One further problem has been foisted upon Cricket Australia with a side strain ruling allrounder Marcus Stoinis out of at least today’s encounter. Mitchell Marsh has been flown over as cover but no announcement has been made on whether he will be called into the squad as in injury replacement.As for Pakistan, who knows from one day to the next? An ODI series whitewash against England preceded a World Cup warm-up defeat to Afghanistan, setting the tone for dismemberment at the hands of the West Indies in their opening group game. Doom and gloom? No chance. Pakistan’s predictable unpredictability meant of course they would beat tournament favourites England to remind doubting rivals they remain a force on their day. A washout against Sri Lanka has complicated their route to the semi-finals, making today’s fixture of utmost importance. The last time they faced Australia they lost five ODIs in a row in the UAE, which makes them favourites today, right? While I go off and find out the teams, observe the toss, and check on the weather, why don’t you send me a tweet or drop me an email. This place is always more fun when I’m not the only person talking.

Nicholas Hytner now seeks to repeat the process with an immersive Dream that has half the audience standing and that looks both to the past and the future. Its spectacular use of aerial acrobatics evokes memories of Peter Brook’s legendary 1970 production, while its reassignment of much of the text is in line with our faith in sexual liberation. I loved the fiesta-like atmosphere while questioning the textual transpositions.The evening begins with the prolonged imprisonment of Hippolyta – played by Gwendoline Christie of Game of Thrones fame – in a glass cage. She is clearly the captive bride of Oliver Chris’s autocratic Theseus: the evening’s most moving moment is the look of wounded complicity Christie shares with Isis Hainsworth’s similarly threatened Hermia. As is common, Hippolyta and Theseus then mutate into the fairy queen and king, but Titania speaks lines normally assigned to Oberon while Oberon speaks hers. It is a startling reversal that has loss as well as gain.The bonus is that it heightens the comedy to see Oberon falling head over heels for an ass: the sight of Chris lasciviously nibbling the erect ears of the translated Bottom is one I shan’t soon forget. The payoff comes when, returning to Theseus, Chris is forced to soften his sexual authoritarianism by recalling his dalliance as Oberon with a male donkey. But, while the role reversal gives TitaniaHippolyta unusual agency, it has perverse side-effects. The great speech in which the fairy queen laments the death of her votaress sounds odd coming from a man. I’d also argue that you don’t need to fiddle with the text for the play to offer a critique of male power hunger.Hytner’s purpose, I guess, is to question the idea of a rigid, binary sexuality. This leads him, mistakenly I believe, to show Lysander and Demetrius, as well as Hermia and Helena, snogging each other in the midst of what is meant to be a fierce fight in the forest. But, for all its excesses, the production is staged with immense physical bravura and is great fun. Hammed Animashaun is a suitably overweening Bottom fascinated to be treated as the fairy king’s toy boy while protesting: “Not now. I’ve got a headache.” He also leads a mixed-gender group of mechanicals who perform the Pyramus and Thisbe interlude in tracksuits as if they were a mime ensemble. David Moorst is also an extraordinary high-wire Puck interacting with the audience as freely as with the immortals.A wealth of invention has gone into the show. Bunny Christie’s design is full of airborne beds and rising greensward, although, unforgivably, the manoeuvring of the set distracts from Puck’s final speech. Arlene Phillips as movement director and Lennin Nelson-McClure as circus captain create some eye-catching gymnastics. We even get a full-throated rendering of Dizzee Rascal’s Bonkers. That song, which proclaims “Man, I’m just livin’ my life”, might be said to epitomise a pleasantly bonkers show that celebrates a freewheeling pan-sexuality. But, while Hytner’s production is like a delirious party, I would have enjoyed it still more if it released the microscopic beauties of Shakespeare’s text as well as the play’s comic energy. • At the Bridge theatre, London, until 31 August.

That’s whether he’s springing naked from the boot of a car in The Hangover and landing crotch-first on Bradley Cooper’s mouth like the face-hugger in Alien. Or stalking the stage at the start of his new Netflix special, making slow-motion masturbatory hand gestures, his fingers miming the spray of ejaculate in his fans’ faces. Far from being offended, the crowd squeals delightedly, recognising it as the trademark of Mr Chow, the camp, motormouthed gangster played by Jeong in all three Hangover movies, which cemented his move from physician to jobbing comic to film phenomenon and ensured that, should he so choose, he could leave behind the standup circuit for ever.And yet here he is, back on the road again after a decade of film and television success, and heading to London for his first UK date a few weeks shy of his 50th birthday. “I never, ever want to quit standup,” he tells me from his home in Los Angeles, his default tone one of grave and emphatic humility. “Standup has become a deeply personal journey for me, and I’m very grateful to have the career I do.”If that sounds like an implausibly strait-laced response from the man who named his Netflix show You Complete Me, Ho, it’s important to know that the last word in that title is not a misogynistic epithet but a reference to his wife, Tran Ho. It is her experience of breast cancer – she has been cancer-free now for 11 years – that lends weight to a set that would otherwise be dominated by callbacks to Jeong’s movies, shout-outs to famous chums (there’s a meeting-Obama anecdote) and war stories from his medical days.Twelve years ago, he stole several scenes as a volatile doctor in Judd Apatow’s Knocked Up before going on to play assorted uptight child-men, including the taunting, short-fused Spanish teacher Señor Chang in six seasons of the smart-aleck sitcom Community, and a petty tyrant who dresses as a medieval king in Role Models. He had a cameo in the romcom Crazy Rich Asians and created his own autobiographical sitcom Dr Ken. When that was cancelled in 2017 after two seasons, he found himself itching to return to his comedy roots. “I missed writing and creating stuff. Through doing Dr Ken I learned to write personally – we’d even done an episode inspired by Tran’s cancer – and I wanted to bring that into my standup.”Something else has changed, too. Compare Jeong’s performing style and material from 20 or even 10 years ago (much of it is still accessible on YouTube) and there is a marked softening of tone. It may partly be that we now know him better: it’s hard to feel intimidated by someone who has not only flailed around naked on screen but also seizes every opportunity to draw attention to his own supposed shortcomings. It was his wife, after all, who predicted that The Hangover would be a feelgood hit because the most insecure male viewer would consider himself well-endowed compared with her husband.But it’s more than that. Jeong’s jabbing delivery has lost some of its off-putting aggression, and his language now is more considered. “When I started I had 15 strong minutes. I was on the bill with Adam Sandler at the Improv, and when you’re opening you have to fight to survive.” Two decades ago, he compared and contrasted various Asian accents, describing the more elaborate Vietnamese delivery as “kinda faggy”. The rudiments of that routine have endured into the Netflix special but without the homophobia now he says that the Vietnamese sound like “Koreans on weed”. (Jeong was raised in North Carolina by Korean parents, and refers to Koreans as “the hottest-tempered of all Asians”.)In another early joke, he recalled being inundated as a doctor with hypochondriacs who were convinced they had cancer. His remedy, he used to say, was to prescribe chemotherapy for all. “No, no, no,” he shudders when I ask if he would include that gag today. “Never ever. My wife and I have talked about that. You evolve as you go along. And comedians, like all people, should be allowed to do that. In the days of social media, that’s all changed. But I believe we should be given space to evolve our viewpoints and our philosophies. As triumph and tragedy strike us, we do change. I certainly have.”One significant alteration in his life has been material, as he reminds his audience at regular intervals. “I live in Los Angeles – the rich part,” he boasts, while another joke begins: “Even if I wasn’t rich and famous, which I am …” He hoots when I point out this tendency. “Oh my God, I love doing that! I’m not that rich really. I’ve done it sometimes when I’ve performed with much wealthier comics – Ray Romano or Chris Rock – and it tickles me no end. I’m sure I’ll lean on that in London if a couple of jokes don’t go so well. I’ll just say, ‘It’s OK, I could buy this whole theatre …’”• Ken Jeong is at the Adelphi theatre, London, on 23 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed3cfaf952d7752723f80d622e0a289c2f6f583/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e694fd19ad03b57f72ef22344dcb896 480w","title":"whats the single typo thats had the most impact on your life","story":" From accidental clicks to mistaken keystrokes, we would like to hear how you have suffered or benefited from a typoUsing our thumbs at speed to send messages, make calls and browse online, more often than not we make mistakes.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

What happened to all the black angels?’”So Muhammad Ali told an interviewer, before giving a knowing look and – boom! – the punchline. “Black angels are in the kitchen preparing milk and honey.”What’s My Name: Muhammad Ali (Sky Atlantic) suggests that the greatest boxer the world has ever seen changed his name from Cassius Clay and became a devotee of Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam because the Christianity of his childhood whitewashed the past and heaven, too. If there is a heaven worth the name, then Ali, who died three years ago, is in it. Although not, you suspect, making snacks for white folk.The director, Antoine Fuqua, strives to deliver what Ali, quoted at the outset, wanted: “A life story should be … everything in it. Why I joined Elijah Muhammad. What experiences I had racially.”What Ali experienced racially was typified by his return to his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, after winning a gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games. A waitress at a downtown diner told him: “We don’t serve negroes.” “I don’t eat them, either,” the teenage prodigy answered. “Just give me a cup of coffee and a hamburger.” Whether it went down quite like that is another matter. Ali’s self-narrated legend eclipses whatever narrative Fuqua may have wanted to tell. That said, Fuqua obligingly banishes the memory of Will Smith’s Ali biopic and aspires to the poetry of When We Were Kings, Leon Gast’s Oscar-winning 1996 documentary about Ali and George Foreman’s Rumble in the Jungle.Louisville, at least, spurred little Cassius to take up boxing. The 12-year-old resolved to learn to box just to whup the boy who stole his bike. A year later, he won his first bout by 1964, he was heavyweight champion of the world. That world title bout with Sonny Liston demonstrated his ruthlessness in the ring and mastery of that now ubiquitous art form, cryptohomicidal trash talk. A kid in a television audience asked whether, after he had beaten the champion, Clay would ask for a rematch: “After I beat Sonny, you couldn’t melt him and pour him on me again.”By then, the National Security Agency was tapping Ali’s phone because he refused the Vietnam draft. “I’m not going 10,000 miles from home to help murder and burn another poor nation simply to continue the domination of white slave masters of the darker people the world over.” Cassius Clay, showboating boxing prodigy, was dead long live Muhammad Ali, African-American hero.Fuqua revels in narrating Ali’s 1967 bout with Ernie Terrell, the man who made the mistake of not respecting this name change. When, in pre-fight trash talk, Terrell called Ali by his old name, Ali snapped. “I’m going to whup him until he says my name.” During the fight, Ali danced around, shouting at Terrell: “What’s my name?” Although he beat his foe savagely, he refused to move in for the knockout. We never learn if Terrell called Ali by his name afterwards.Later, banned for three years from boxing and threatened with five years in jail and a $10,000 fine for refusing the draft, Ali was superbly, wittily sanguine: “So I’ll go to jail so what? We’ve been in jail for 400 years.”Fuqua, though, betrays Ali’s notion of a life story. Everything is not in it. Even though Ali said in 1967: “My toughest fight was with my first wife,” his family life is off-limits. Nor, sadly, does the film include footage from the Broadway musical Buck White, in which he starred in during his lay-off, as a militant black professor.Instead, the first part of this gripping three-hour biography ends with the revenge-seeker’s comeuppance. Returning to the ring after the ban to reclaim his heavyweight crown from Joe Frazier, he was decked twice and lost. The shock defeat poignantly echoed Anthony Joshua’s recent humbling – another handsome, stylish boxer laid low by a smaller, gnarlier foe with less in the way of looks to lose.It wasn’t the only time Ali was revealed to be less than perfect. As the credits roll on part one, Fuqua chooses to play Stand By Me. Oh dear, I thought, he has chosen an outtake of Ben E King singing off-key. But no. The credits reveal that the singer was one Muhammad Ali. In one area of life, at least, the Greatest had feet of clay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645634a05344545ac2cd28d8800adebd9fbc6e42/1473_153_3505_2103/master/3505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e00b3638f8b13c60511b1698e7d10cb","title":"victoria hamilton women can now carry shows without faces full of botox","story":"She donned a specially modified swimsuit to play the Queen Mother in The Crown. Now she’s a spy-busting gay senator in Deep State – and revelling in its love story Shortly before I’m due to interview her in a hotel room, I run into Victoria Hamilton in the loo. I wouldn’t have recognised her from The Crown, in which she plays the Queen Mother, even though she swears they did nothing to her appearance – except make her wear “a swimsuit that had tits built into my stomach. Then they’d take all my makeup off and put a grey wig on my head.”I would have recognised her from Deep State, because I’d only just watched an episode: a hot, gory spy drama, paranoid and nail-biting. But really I recognise her because I feel like I already know her from all her great theatre roles and countless period dramas, from Scoop to Mansfield Park.Fantastically warm and funny, Hamilton brings a huge amount to a conversation with just eyebrows and intonation. When we talk about The Crown, the acclaimed Netflix series about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, I mention that it can’t have sounded like a very interesting proposition: just a bunch of rich, repressed people doing what they’re told. “Honestly,” she says, “most actors’ first thought was, ‘Really, really? More royalty. Really? Really? The Queen Mother? Really?’” It’s like a masterclass in how many different ways there are to say “really” in a sceptical and unenthusiastic voice.In the Fox series Deep State, she plays a gay Republican senator facing a cover-up as she investigates the deaths of special forces agents in Mali. “It’s very pertinent,” she says. “This sense that there are decisions being made and we have no idea who’s making them, conflicts being funded for agendas we have no clue about.”As for her part, she says: “I think there’s never been a better time to be an actress over 40. They really are starting to write fully rounded protagonist roles for women who aren’t 35. I never thought, at 48, I’d be doing a job that had a love story written into it. If you’d told me that 10 years ago, my jaw would have been on the floor. Your fuckability quotient – wait, you can’t put that in an article.”Can’t I? “Oh, go on then. It started to happen with The Killing and Borgen, where not only were women carrying shows, they didn’t have a face full of Botox and weren’t pneumatic-looking. And the sexuality of those women was suddenly real. Real bodies and real people and it’s 100 times sexier than the sex scenes that we’ve all been watching for decades, faked and airbrushed and boring.”Theatre aside, it’s only recently that Hamilton has been cast as a character who wasn’t incredibly sweet. “Because that’s the sort of face I’ve got – in film, the personality of your face gets cast, instead of necessarily what’s inside. That’s why I spent the first 10 years of my career in theatre, and still constantly go back. The roles have more depth. There’s a wonderful thing that happens where someone can hit the stage and, within half an hour, you think that is the ugliest or the most beautiful person you’ve ever seen. Whatever stage energy you’ve chosen to give to that character is more important than what you look like.”She adds: “Also, most theatre isn’t shit. And quite a lot of telly is shit. Or was, until a few years ago. This is a hugely highfalutin conversation. ‘Why do you love theatre?’ ‘Because it’s not shit.’”The Crown was much more daring at first than it seems, now that it’s been so successful: not for each inidual actor so much as the whole thing, and how awesomely expensive it was. This, it turns out, was down to executive producer Stephen Daldry. “Basically, Stephen was trying to create a hybrid between TV and film, holding out for those extraordinary budgets. So in a strange way, much as doing the second series was wonderful, once it had this big stamp of approval, it felt less exciting, because it wasn’t going to fail on that epic scale.”She seems entranced by the spectacle of disaster, the randomness and absurdity of what works and what doesn’t. “Oh, it’s only romantic when you’ve got a job. Doing that backslapping thing, ‘We’re so brave, this is so romantic.’”“I don’t really look the way I am,” Hamilton says, though she’s just said she looks like an “elf with tits”, and it’s difficult to know how that would be. She’s never been cast in a successful comedy, which is odd because, conversationally, she is funny – witty, caustic and surreal. “You’re allowed to be funny if you look a certain way. If you then play a part that has a lot of gravitas and darkness, you’re something else and it’s hard to get back. If anyone finds you sexy, you can’t be sexy and funny. Because of course you can’t laugh and have a hard-on at the same time.” There’s a pause while we both consider this. “Actually, that is true, you can’t.”She’d love another series of Deep State. She wants to do a one-woman show. She has a TV series she can’t talk about that takes her to October, an unprecedented run, she says, of gainful employment. While acclaim came pretty fast for Hamilton’s work on stage, it was always precarious.She may be being a little too modest, when in fact there has been considerable deliberation in her career, a lot of careful choices. She talks about taking A Day in the Death of Joe Egg to Broadway with Eddie Izzard in 2003. “It went really well and got nominated for Tonys. I had all of New York saying, ‘You’ve to go to LA.’ I didn’t and I’m glad – and the reason is that I would have been completely destroyed. If you didn’t look like Cameron Diaz, you would get slaughtered and end up doing work you didn’t want to do.”And as a result, she is not especially famous: “Real fame is if you can’t get on the tube. All I get is people squinting at me, which on a vulnerable day is very odd. You’ve walked around London and people have just frowned at you, as if they slightly disapprove of you.” But then, on the other hand, there’s a body of work that has range, that’s been memorable – and never trivial. • Deep State is on Fox in the UK at 9pm on Thursdays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/000557bb24705087f473f874b5f6b297b05c2b57/0_551_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccff51609e18eb21c73dd28bc3f9ba1f","title":"yevgeny prigozhin who is the man leading russias push into africa","story":"Former hotdog seller became known as ‘Putin’s chef’ because of his Kremlin catering contactsThe man behind Russia’s push into Africa is a former hotdog seller who went on to become a billionaire and global Kremlin action man thanks to his close relations with Vladimir Putin.Yevgeny Prigozhin grew up in Putin’s home city of Leningrad. He spent nine years in jail after being convicted by a Soviet court of robbery and other crimes. When he emerged from prison he decided to go into business, first opening a hotdog stall and then founding an elite restaurant.The venture on a docked boat was a success. In 2001 Prigozhin personally served two guests who had stopped by for dinner: Russia’s new president, Putin, and Japan’s prime minister, Yoshirō Mori. Soon Prigozhin was doing the catering for Kremlin banquets and for Putin’s 2003 birthday party, earning him the nickname “Putin’s chef”.On good terms with Russia’s elite, Prigozhin branched out. He won lucrative state contracts to supply food to Russian schoolchildren and to its soldiers. With money came an oligarch lifestyle: a palace in St Petersburg, a yacht, a private plane, a helipad.It is Prigozhin’s activities on behalf of the state that have made him notorious. According to the US special counsel Robert Mueller, Prigozhin’s trolls working out of the Olgino area of St Petersburg interfered in the 2016 election. Prigozhin, senior employees and his company, Concord Catering, are all under US indictment.Prigozhin is believed to be a funder of the Wagner group, a private military contractor. Hundreds of Russian mercenaries, some tied to Wagner, were reportedly killed in clashes with US forces during a doomed attempt to seize an oil refinery in Syria in February 2018. Other mercenaries have fought for Wagner in Ukraine.Critics including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny have described Prigozhin’s rise as a parable of Russia under Putin. Prigozhin has grown rich because of his proximity to Russia’s forever ruler, Navalny alleges. He has nicknamed Prigozhin the “king of dislikes”.Leaked documents paint a portrait of Prigozhin as a hyperactive businessman and micro-manager with a flair for logistics. As well as dispatching undercover political consultants to Africa, Prigozhin-linked companies have sent supplies of tea, coffee and pasta. These fuel the growing number of Russian personnel and military experts on the continent.Prigozhin, 57, refuses to give interviews. He has denied that Wagner exists or that he ever ran a troll farm. Of the US indictment, he said last year: “I am not at all disappointed that I appear in this list. If they want to see the devil, let them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8621250a35c70c638907317d0c6d27ed947e84b0/6_66_5624_3373/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2512e8a9ffc1a59ae00b562d78e237","title":"backlash in samoa over hypocritical rocketman ban","story":"Activists accuse censors of ‘selective morality’ in nation where transgender women are widely acceptedThe banning of Rocketman, a biographic film about the life of musician Elton John, in Samoa has prompted criticism by human rights activists of “selective morality” in a country where transgender women are widely accepted.The public found out about the ban through the cancellation of a screening by the only theatre in the country, Apollo Cinemas Samoa, on Monday.The censorship of the film has since been referred to as “hypocritical” by human rights activists inside Samoa, where fa’afafines are recognised as a third gender.Fa’afafines – children who are assigned male at birth but then raised by their families as girls – are an accepted demographic in Samoan society and are leaders in private sector, government and in village communities.Their participation in national affairs is prominent and widely applauded as evident by the fact that the patron of the Samoa Fa’afafine Association is the prime minister Tuilaepa Sailele Lupesoliai Malielegaoi .President of the Samoa Fa’afafine Association Su’a Alex Su’a said the censorship was “discriminatory after the board banned film on the basis that it does not follow “Christian values”.“You cannot censor what is open, fa’afafines are a celebrated part of our community. This is a selective morality issue,” said Tuisina Ymania Brown, co-secretary general of the International LGBTI Association.Toleafoa Chris Solomona, a cultural expert from Savaii said has referred to the banning as “ignorant.”Brown agreed and accused the Church of influencing the decision. “The Church is now reaching into controlling peoples perception by banning the celebration of art, Rocketman is essentially a celebration of an artist,” Brown said.This is not the first time Samoa’s censor board has made international news for banning films depicting homosexuality. In 2009 Samoa banned Milk – the film about the life of gay rights activist Harvey Milk – yet in the same week it allowed the screening of Lesbian Vampire Killers.The board however approved Bohemian Rhapsody, the Freddie Mercury biopic, which proved popular among cinema-goers. “Maybe the Censor Board didn’t know that our main man Freddie Mercury was gay, so I guess that’s a good thing,” said Solomona.Elton John’s music is popular among rural Samoans – with Nikita and Goodbye Englands Rose commonly heard in wooden buses during cross-island journeys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee9ff76d40e0fcdde216592c9b869f0e2c85e223/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e09774a5bfafd697eb27bf4e677e49bb","title":"wednesday briefing here comes boris","story":"Ex-foreign secretary launches Tory leadership campaign … Hong Kong protests force delay to extradition bill … and is it healthy to want to mute the world?Hello, Warren Murray here, as we go once more unto the briefing.Boris Johnson will today launch his long dreamt-of campaign to be prime minister.

The proposed law had been due for a second round of debate in the 70-seat legislative council today. Thousands of parents and teachers called for a boycott of work and classes to show their opposition to the proposed bill, which would allow mainland China to pursue fugitives in the former British colony.Schools ‘go cap in hand’ for funds – The cash-strapped Downshall primary school in Ilford, east London, has asked BBC Children in Need for funding to support disadvantaged pupils.

A  investigation recently revealed more than 1,000 schools across England have turned to crowdfunding websites and wish lists to raise money just for basics. Kevin Courtney from the National Education Union said: “Headteachers are having to go cap in hand to beg money from wherever they can just to keep their heads above water.” The Department for Education said while schools faced “budgeting challenges”, Downshall had received an increase per student, and in the next spending review the education secretary intended to “back headteachers to have the resources they need”.\u0026gt Theresa May will commit Britain to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, making it the first major economy to do so.

Author and naturalist  Mark Cocker reveals what you should be looking out forAt this moment in the year, there are few landscapes in the country that give a more complete sense of life’s renewal than a British wood. You are instantly aware of how the harsh atmosphere that gripped the bare trees in winter has suddenly been burst asunder. Fresh greenery is all around and the sap in some trees can flow so vigorously that you can put your ear to the trunk and even hear it gurgling and crackling as it rises.While we may feel surrounded by new life, it is well to recall that we are also in the presence of something ancient. Most of our deciduous trees – which make up the bulk of the UK’s woodland – are seed-bearing varieties. Trees such as oaks, ash, hazel, beech, lime and birch have a heritage dating back 125m years.A fascinating feature of woods, which indicates the timescale in which they have evolved, is that if a young hazel or ash tree is cut down, the organism does not normally die. Instead, from the stump arises a fountain spray of new growth. The great scholar of landscape history Oliver Rackham judged that this reflex by trees was how they had evolved to cope with prehistoric elephant damage, when the animals once roamed through this country, plucking and eating branches.The elephants may have gone, but the trees are still reacting and our Neolithic ancestors learned to exploit this behaviour to make the woods work for them. The cutting process, known as “coppicing”, has been a part of British woodland management for thousands of years. It results in an abundance of pole-like branches that can be used as building materials or charcoal. Look out in many woods for the great thickets of hazel coppicing.The flowers that often carpet woodlands are at the heart of any spring visit, but their environment presents them with a challenge. When the leaves on the trees have fully emerged, the closed canopy traps everything underneath in heavy shadow. Woodland plants thus benefit from coppicing because it allows light to flood down, but the plants also flower before the tree leaves are out, making late April about the best time to enjoy them.In old, well-maintained woods the ground is sometimes smothered, first in snowdrops, then lesser celandines, primroses, dog-violets, wood anemones and wild garlic – whose name gives a clue to the strong reek that fills the air – and finally, and most famously, in bluebells. The latter can result in a continuous carpet of dark, smoky blue flowers rippling across the woodland floor.These, in turn, are a major attraction for the first bumblebee queens that are establishing new colonies, as well as early spring butterflies including brimstones and orange-tips. Bluebell woods, which are one of the most beautiful visions in all of nature, are found in almost every county from Cornwall to Caithness and are very much a speciality of these islands.Another feature in which British woods are better endowed than those of almost any other European country is very ancient trees. Often misshapen, with frequent amputations where their limbs have broken off in storms, these “veterans”, as they are known, are ecologically important. Standing deadwood, which can persist on the tree for decades, is a valuable habitat for many types of insect.Certain places have become famous for their veterans, including Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire. There are even older coppiced beech trees in Epping Forest, which may be as much as 1,000 years old.Best known of all perhaps is a tree with its own road directions – the Major Oak in Sherwood Forest. This monster, with its 10-metre waistband, is thought to be about 1,100 years old and receives 500,000 visitors a year.Ancient trees such as this one encourage us to ponder the cultural changes to which they have been witness. Yet all woods are subject to a natural, annual and cyclical process that makes almost every visit a completely different experience.In spring, the landscape may resound to the sounds of the birds. Flowers are in full bloom and the new leaf growth has a delicate soft shade of green. Yet come again in high summer and the atmosphere is warmer, but heavier and darker. The trees have largely fallen silent but for the perpetual drone of woodland insects.By autumn, the foliage is acquiring a new palette, while the ground has a sudden second explosion of colour because of the season’s mushrooms. When the canopy finally falls, there may be the melancholy drama of winter, but it too is set to the deliciously crunchy, upbeat music of all those leaves underfoot.The real joy of woods is that they are ever-changing. No single encounter can do justice to their complexity. No visit is the same as the last."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3922652.1560285121!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit would present huge difficulties to businesses in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, who warns it would be a ‘terrible political miscalculation’ for anyone in London to think they will automatically get a better Brexit deal after Westminster’s failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement. File photograph: John ThysReutersBusinesses in Northern Ireland would face massive difficulties in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to an expert report carried out for the Northern Ireland civil service, with the burden falling most heavily on small and medium enterprises.The findings of the report by two lawyers specialising in EU and international customs law present a “sobering reflection of the limited room for manoeuvre for businesses and government in a no-deal context”, according to an accompanying note from the North’s Department for the Economy.“It confirms the Northern Ireland Civil Service’s concern about the impact of EU tariffs on food exports to Ireland, and the ability of micro and small enterprises with no experience in customs procedures and operations to continue to export to Ireland,” the department’s summary of the report says.The report, written by Eric Pickett and Michael Lux, warns that schemes to avoid trade barriers and Border checks – so-called “facilitation” – would have a limited application, especially for smaller businesses who may not have the ability, scope or expertise to use schemes to minimise trade barriers.Agriculture worst affectedTrade between the Republic and the North would be hugely affected, the report warns, with agricultural trade worst affected. It lays out in great detail an array of checks, inspections and declarations which could be required.Trade across the Border is especially important to very small businesses in the North. “Over 80 per cent of microenterprises (employing fewer than 10 people) in Northern Ireland who export, only export to the Republic of Ireland,” the accompanying note says.The report finds that there are several “facilitations” that could be employed to ease the trade restrictions that would automatically occur in the event of a no-deal. However, many of these would require an agreement with the EU, and therefore would not come into operation automatically.The department’s summary says the report “provides further evidence of the difficulties that would arise ... in a no-deal context and of the consequent risk to the Northern Ireland economy”.Electronic monitoringThe report says the EU and the UK could seek an exemption from World Trade Organization rules which would require tariffs and border checks on security grounds. However, it says this is likely to be temporary and the EU is “unlikely to agree to sweeping exceptions from border controls”.The report is cool on the suggestion that electronic monitoring of the Border could be a substitute for checks.“Although the Border does not have any customs posts, there is some surveillance of vehicle movements. The authorities are thus able to track cars, trucks, etc in their journey along and across the Border. However, this surveillance is for security purposes,” it says.“In practice, effective implementation of the objectives articulated in the customs authority’s mission can only be achieved by conducting inspections based on risk-analysis methods, which includes random checks.“Furthermore, the existing security-based surveillance infrastructure would have to be repurposed for customs. Aside from the issue of whether such repurposing is technically feasible in the light of the situation under a no-deal scenario, there is the issue of whether it would be politically acceptable, including amongst the population living along the Border,” it says.Inspection postsIt also says that the Republic will have to establish inspection posts that are closer to the Border.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned it would be a “terrible political miscalculation” for anyone in London to think they will automatically get a better Brexit deal after Westminster’s failure to ratify the withdrawal agreement.“That is really to misunderstand how the European Union works,” he said.He said outgoing British prime minister Theresa May “wasn’t a bad negotiator. She had a good team. I believe they got the best deal they could have got, given the limited leverage that a country leaving the EU has.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

There are 87 calories in 100g of yogurt. Priti has 60g of banana and 150g of yogurt for breakfast. Work out the total number of calories in this breakfast”.Following the concerns, Pearson, which owns the exam board EdExcel, carried out a review of the question and found it to be valid.A spokesman for Pearson said that any student “who thinks that this question may have impacted their performance” should make contact via their school.Poppy-Willow Kent, a student from Colchester, wrote on Twitter: “I am sorry, but can I ask what on earth you were thinking by having a question around counting calories? Your exams are primarily taken by 15-20 year olds, who are also the age group most likely to suffer from eating disorder.”A 16-year-old student from Hampshire added: “The weighing food and calorie question on the paper today triggered me so much. Hopefully it didn’t upset anyone else who suffers. It just bought back so many bad memories for me that I was about to cry. Do they know about the crisis or I’m being over sensitive?”Meanwhile, Isobel Colclough, 16, from Stoke-on-Trent, explained how the question left her in a panic and she had to leave the exam hall. I read the question and it bought back so many memories of counting calories, it put me into a panic where I had to leave the room for about five minutes and a teaching assistant calmed me down, she said.  Then the teaching assistant persuaded me to go back into the room and I did manage to finish the exam but it stayed on my mind for quite a while after. For someone who has in the past been obsessed with counting calories, it definitely triggered memories of counting everything.Miss Colclough, who used to be anorexic, said she is considering making a formal complaint about the question.  It is the latest exam question to have sparked debate this summer.Any student “who thinks that this question may have impacted their performance” should make contact via their school, Pearson saidThe exam board AQA came under fire from students for a GCSE English exam which used a passage from a book in which a character was later raped.Pupils complained that the unseen text in their exam paper was taken from a story that later goes on to detail how a young woman becomes pregnant after being sexually exploited by her employer.The description of the rape was not part of the excerpt in the exam paper, but students nonetheless protested that the excerpt should have come with a “trigger warning”.   AQA denied that the choice of extract was inappropriate. Tom Quinn, a director at the eating disorder charity Beat, said that references to counting calories “can be triggering” for anyone with or recovering from an eating disorder.  He said it can “cause significant distress”, adding that since young people are most at risk of these serious mental illnesses, exam boards should avoid such material in their questions.   A spokesman for Pearson said: “In a maths exam taken last week, candidates were asked to solve a practical problem calculating the number of calories in a banana and a yogurt. We have reviewed the question and find it to be valid.“We encourage any student who thinks that this question may have impacted their performance to get in contact with us via their school.“We understand the summer exam series is a stressful time for students and we wish all students every success with their remaining exams.”Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

From sending emails to checking social media to driving to friend’s houses, batteries keep 21st-century life in motion.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis reliance is set to increase over the coming decades. As we move towards a coal-free future, batteries will increasingly be used in conjunction with renewable energy production.\u0026nbspOne problem with renewable energy sources is that turbines generate electricity only\u0026nbspif it\u0027s windy and solar panels work only\u0026nbspwhen the sun shines. Batteries help us get around this problem as they can store energy and release it when demand is high.\u0026nbspThis week it was announced that the UK\u0027s biggest battery was going to be built at Whitelee wind farm near Glasgow. The battery will store power generated by 215 turbines and should prop up the National Grid even when the wind is not blowing.Biggest battery ever seen in UK to be installed at Glasgow wind farmThis is expected to be the first of at least six similar projects across Scottish Power\u0027s renewable energy sites.\u0026nbspIt follows the world\u0027s largest battery installation in Adelaide in 2017. The project was built to store energy alongside Neoen’s Hornsdale windfarm, near Jamestown. At the end of last year figures presented by the Australian Energy Week suggested the new system had reduced the price of power outages by 90 per cent.\u0026nbspThese developments are often exciting but the raw materials used to build this technology come with their own environmental costs.\u0026nbspCurrently 75 per cent of the world’s lithium comes from Australia, Chile, Argentine and China. Some analysts fear that South America could become the new “Middle East” as battery power starts to replace coal. “Bolivia would become far more of a focus of world attention than Saudi Arabia ever was,” according to experts from Meridian International Research.A key element in lithium-iron batteries is cobalt in the positive electrodes (or cathodes). More than 60 per cent of the world\u0027s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u0026nbspChinese companies are running many of the country’s industrial mines using more than 35,000 children – some as young as six – to do the dirty work. They are risking their lives to mine cobalt for big electronic firms, many of which are likely to be aware of the appalling conditions they work in.\u0026nbspThere is also a geopolitical risk\u0026nbspif governments decide to restrict supply.A 2015 report found that 82 per cent of the world’s graphite – another key component in batteries – comes from China. Manufacturers should be concerned about the supply of key components becoming centralised in one country.\u0026nbspThere is a lot of enthusiastic investment in batteries but we need to think carefully about the environmental and political implications of extracting metals that made them.\u0026nbspRecycling rates for lithium are currently very low and if we continue to discard old metals, battery power might not look so green after all.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

England, 2011District Judge Joanna Dickens also imposed a 12-week suspended sentence on Hannah Rose, the hunt’s kennel maid.The trial was told how live fox cubs were used to “blood” hounds at kennels, teaching the dogs to kill foxes.Suspending the sentences for a year, the district judge at Birmingham magistrates’ court said: “The fox cubs suffered a painful, terrifying death.”Explaining her reasons for not banning the couple from keeping animals, she added: “I think the chance of any reoccurrence is minimal.Our feeble fox hunting laws desperately need to changeFox hunter who fed live cubs to dogs spared jail and avoids animal banFox hunter fed live fox cubs to his dogs, court findsFour fox cubs saved by farmer who performed cesarean on dead mother “I also take into account that to disqualify them from being in control of animals would cause them to lose their current employment and any hope of future work, as this is their livelihood.”But Anthony Joynes, an RSPCA inspector, said that in a similar situation a few years ago, in which a live fox was put in a cage containing dogs, the suspects were jailed and given a lifetime ban on keeping\u0026nbspanimals.“It’s very frustrating how there is no apparent consistency when it comes to sentencing,” he said, adding that he wouldn’t lose sleep if the pair had lost their jobs.By contrast, shoplifters are routinely jailed. Last month, Kevin Monk, 40, was jailed for four months in Dundee for stealing more than £100 worth of goods. His solicitor said Monk’s benefits had been stopped and he was unable to buy food or heat his home.Police catch starving woman stealing food, buy her lunchThe Birmingham court heard how Oliver and Rose look after a private stud yard, caring for 14 horses and several dogs.Andrew Cooke, a biologist and vet scientist, tweeted: “I can’t begin to get my head around how shockingly lenient that is. No served time, no ban on keeping animals, no deterrent.“I can’t fathom why lengthy or lifetime bans aren’t more commonplace.”The couple could potentially have been jailed for up to six months – the maximum term for animal cruelty\u0026nbspunder current legislation. The\u0026nbspgovernment plans to raise the sentencing limit for such offences to five years on hold.Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, said: “This case of appalling cruelty highlights the need to get serious about tackling wildlife crime and animal cruelty.“The government has dragged its feet on extending sentences for cases of animal cruelty and must bring forward this legislation without further delay.“Last Boxing Day, Labour announced our intention to close a number of loopholes in the Hunting Act to prevent illegal hunting.”Labour proposals\u0026nbspinclude\u0026nbsppossible jail terms for illegal hunting.\u0026nbspThe Hunt Investigation Team, which took the footage that formed the basis of the prosecution, said: “This is not enough, this is not justice for the fox cubs. The judiciary has failed in its duty to protect wild animals.”MP Sir David Amess, a patron of Conservatives Against Fox Hunting,\u0026nbspsaid the sentencing showed the need for law reform. “The case is absolutely appalling, and shows nothing but sheer cruelty and utter disregard for an animal’s life,” he said.“What is worse is the shockingly lenient sentencing means that these people have walked free from jail.“That such cruelty can go unpunished shows that we now more than ever need to strengthen the Hunting Act and reform our laws to stop those convicted of such horrendous acts from keeping animals ever again.”Other animal lovers said the sentences were “obscenely lenient”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can’t put into law that you can’t leave without a deal.”She insisted\u0026nbspthat, as prime minister, she would be ready to drop her own Brexit bills in order to stop MPs using them as a means to delay departure.Ms Leadsom has put forward proposals for a “managed exit” which would retain elements of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement such as citizens’ rights provisions, alongside a temporary free trade deal. But she has made clear she is ready to leave without a deal on 31 October if necessary.New prime minister will not be able to change Brexit deal, EU saysCorbyn could become PM without election, warns Tory leader contenderBoris Johnson’s biggest problem isn’t the Tory leadership raceTen Tory candidates enter race to be next prime ministerBut other candidates insist that the clear majority against no deal in the Commons will make it impossible unless a prime minister suspends parliament to get past the 31 October deadline. And John Bercow, the speaker, has said it is “unimaginable” that the Commons would be denied its voice on the matter.Speaking to a Westminster lunch, Ms Leadsom said: “The speaker does not have executive powers. These are reserved for the government. Parliament can express opinions and amend or reject legislation, but it’s simply not the case that the speaker has the means to stop a no-deal Brexit.“The law says that we are leaving at the end of October, and it’s very difficult to see, with the government determined to leave at the end of October, how you could prevent that from happening.”Ms Leadsom, who has previously clashed with the speaker after he allegedly called her a “stupid woman”, said she was “disappointed” that he had not resigned after nine years as expected. And she held up a “B***cks to Bercow” poster in a jokey reference to their feud.The current legal default is for the UK to leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October, said Ms Leadsom.“We are leaving at the end of October unless there is fresh legislation – a new law – that prevents that from happening,” she said.Her plan involves tabling two bills to provide\u0026nbspher\u0026nbsp“managed exit” by the end of October.If MPs attempted to block no deal by amending these pieces of legislation, the government she led could simply drop the bills, meaning Brexit would go ahead on Halloween but provisions in areas such as citizens’ rights would be lost, she said.Ms Leadsom, who formally launched her leadership bid earlier in the day, also said frontrunner Boris Johnson’s plans for a tax break for higher earners were “not credible”.“In a hung parliament, you cannot have fundamental tax changes,” she said.“As a Conservative, I do believe in people getting to keep more of their hard-earned income. But I look at the parliamentary arithmetic and think that has to wait until we have a majority.“It is just not credible for anybody to be promising huge tax cuts for anybody in this parliament.”Mr Johnson has promised to lift the threshold for the 40 per cent\u0026nbsphigher rate of income tax from £50,000 to £80,000 at a cost of about £10bn.Ms Leadsom also spoke out against the BBC’s decision to end free TV licences for some over-75s.“Free TV licences for the over-75s is a Conservative election manifesto pledge,”\u0026nbspshe said. “We have to make sure it happens.“There’s no question that the over-75s must keep those free TV licences.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s why he has no hopeMr Johnson also came under fire from Mr Stewart, who said Conservative members should ask themselves: “Do you really feel that this is the person that you want engaging in the detail of the future of your health and education, is this the person that you want writing the instructions to your nuclear submarines, is this the man that you want embodying your nation on the world stage and guiding you through the most difficult choice that Britain has faced for 50 years?”And he added: “I trust the Conservative members to arrive at the correct answer.”The cross-party motion has been tabled as a Labour opposition day debate, but unlike typical opposition sessions, it will be binding on the government if it is passed.Also backed by the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens, it clears the agenda on 25 June, giving MPs the chance to introduce measures to prevent a no-deal exit.This could involve setting a date in the future when MPs must be given a vote on whether to go ahead with the deal on offer.Launching his own leadership bid, Mr Javid will say he offers “a new kind of leadership and a new kind of leader”.Recalling the revival in Scottish Conservative fortunes after they “threw out central casting and picked someone totally different” in Ruth Davidson as leader, he will say: “A leader is not just for Christmas, or just for Brexit. We need tomorrow’s leader, today.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

and veterans of more recent conflicts, we have served alongside soldiers from other European nations, supporting each other while under fire or facing danger.“We have learnt that war stinks, that peace is the natural goal for civilisation, and that Europeans are our brothers in arms.“But that peace and friendship is now threatened by Brexit.\u0026nbsp Peace in Europe is not something that should be taken for granted.“We should be proud to lead in Europe, proud that our friends respect us and can rely on us.

Thirteen nations, including British, Irish, French and Dutch, also Belgians, Poles and Czechs - from all branches of the services - were part of that liberation coalition.“As Europeans, we were stronger together then and should be stronger together now.”He added: “What has happened since 2016 is very disturbing, and it’s clear that the military aspects of Brexit weren’t thought about properly.“Politicians trying to force us out of the EU without going back to the people are cowards, not leaders. They have no mandate and no right to behave this way.

He insists that Britain must leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first cabinet member to announce his bid just hours after the Prime Minister declared her departure date. He supported the Prime Minister\u0027s deal when she tried to get it through parliament and is pitching himself as the candidate to unite the Tory party.Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the house of commons, is pitching herself as the party unity candidate. Speaking to Sky News as she announced her bid, Leadsom claimed to be a decisive and compassionate leader. She will prepare to leave without a deal but claims to have a three-point plan for Brexit which she will set out later in the race. Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead. His greatest challenge may prove to be convincing MPs and members to trust him as he earned a bad reputation for standing against Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest after starting the race as Johnson\u0027s campaign manager.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is the most direct opposition to frontrunner Boris Johnson similarly inclined to a hard Brexit but not as controversial among Tory MPs. He would seek a new, fairer deal, though he insists that Britain must leave the EU by October 31.

If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or she could leave. A police officer was eventually sought to deal with Ms Daugereaux with pool workers claiming that the mother used inappropriate language towards staff.Police body camera footage of the incident shows a tearful Ms Daugereaux saying she does not understand what she has done wrong.I\u0027m not being disrespectful, I don\u0027t want to cause a scene, Ms Daugereaux said.

The Mayor should scrap this £K event and use the money instead to keep Newham residents safe.This absurd situation would be funnyit wasn’t such a shocking indictment of this Mayor’s skewed priorities. People will rightly question why Khan is prioritising paddling pools over the safety of vulnerable Londoners.The Mayor has repeatedly said he cant spent more cash on police and fighting crime as his central budgets have been cut too much.Last years pop-up party featured street food stalls and classic film screenings too.The final bill came to an eye-watering £,, we revealed last year.The money for the beach project came from the London Economic Action Partnership - which works under the Mayors office.The cash for the project was from business rates generated in the local area. , Londoners flocked to the beach to enjoy a -metre swimming lido, a sun deck, street food stalls and musical entertainment - all for free.A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: The Royal Docks is set to become a major new district for London with up to , jobs and , new affordable homes. It is set to attract more than £ billion of investment by  .This summer we will be launching the Join The Docks festival with a range of activities for the local community, including a new Kids Summer Splash event.This community festival is funded entirely from local business rates, which must be used for the regeneration of the Royal Docks.

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sooner or later that debt is paid.”It’s open to debate whether the disaster, as Mikhail Gorbachev’s  quote in the credits suggested, led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.What’s undeniable is that Chernobyl is one of the greatest TV dramas of the century.The beautul and touching tribute  Up paid to Lynn Johnson. Over-caffeinated tubbalump Piers Morgan once again turning Good Morning  Britain’s week into a captivating and unmissable mix of news, sport, presidential interviews, free- wheeling abuse and fantastically rude suggestions about Susanna Reid’s love le.And Harry Hill breaking off an insanely funny episode of Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by TalkSport genius Paul Hawksbee, to wonder: “Could I just live off the money from You’ve Been Framed ”Yes, but please don’t.RANDOM TV irritations: Killing Eve II posting a good mid-term shout for the most over-rated and unpleasant show of .The Sky Atlantic continuity pox who talked all over the closing credits of Chernobyl.ITV’s Clive Tyldesley sounding more like a fan than a commentator at the Euro Nations.And Love Island’s Iain Stirling “sending solidarity to the Donald Trump blimp protesters”, at the end of Good Morning Britain, like he was Lech Walesa addressing Gdansk shipyard workers, rather than the ITV dating show bloke doing the warm-up slot for Lorraine Kelly.THE week’s most eye-catching documentary began with a production assistant vox-popping some chimpanzee sex videos and a startled shopper exclaiming:  “Oh wow.“You’re really showing this on Channel  ”What  You thought better of the network behind Naked  Attraction Of course they’re showing My Gay Dog  And Other Animals, a right-on farce which attempted to prove the impossible via a mutt called Norman, whose rear end received not a moment’s peace from a humping little nuisance called Franco, an Italian Greyhound, who really should’ve been called Bruno or Tonioli.There were also “gay” lions and sheep, “bisexual” binobos and some field study input from Professor Paul Vasey, who’s been observing “lesbian” macaques for  years but, like all academics, still has more questions than answers: “Are they doing this to commun- icate about dominance “Are they doing this to form alliances “Are they doing this to reconcile conflict ”Or are they just doing this ’cos they  can’t get Wentworth on Netflix You tell me, weirdo.After a solid hour of virtue-signalling and speculation, though,  it was left to the narrator to tell us what any  three-year-old could’ve explained  minutes ago.“We can’t confirm Franco’s sexuality   per cent, however . . .”BZZZZZ.

Today it is more patronising than ever.Lets look at the youth-oriented BBC Three.In an attempt to appeal to young audiences, the channel focuses on niche, politically-correct content, with the latest hits including a show about a niqab-wearing parachutistand an article praising “eco warriors”.The crusty old relic BBC is trying to appear cool and relevant to the youth - but it has been duped into thinking that loud, hysterical snowflakes are representative of an entire generation.It’s clear that the BBC thinks all young people are Jeremy Corbyn-loving lefties so has skewed its content to be hyper left-wing and social justice-oriented to reflect that, when in reality we have erse opinions. Whisper it, but some of us are even right-wing.And BBC Three’s toe-curling Twitter account is a prime example of how not to communicate with young people.The account has done away with grammar entirely, and whoever runs it communicates almost exclusively in gs. Presumably, they think that’s how we all talk, but it’s not cool or edgy… it’s just awkward.Another part of the BBC’s problem is that younger people just don’t consume news and TV the same way as our parents and grandparents.While older people may be happy to wait for the news headlines on TV, we prefer to get our information on demand, via online news sites.Social media outstrips TV as the main news source for young people, with  per cent of - year olds getting their headline fix that way.These websites are less dry than the stale BBC coverage, and at least with other publications you know up-front what their biases are – they don’t pretend to be impartial while peddling a lefty editorial line like the BBC.Just look at todays BBC news headlines for examples of how dull the news can be.Less-than-riveting articles on the site include “How to cope with email overload”, alongside a piece about whether your dining room table was made from illegally-sourced wood and what your bedroom says about you. It’s not exactly gripping, public-interest journalism.In trying to be everything to everyone, the BBC is failing to satisfy anyone - certainly not young people.And it’s not just their online output which shows it up. Just compare what the rest of the BBC is showing to what’s on offer by its rivals.Netflix is currently airing new episodes of the excellent sci-fi series Black Mirror, while Sky Go viewers are going mad for nuclear disaster drama, Chernobyl.Meanwhile, the top shows on BBC iPlayer at the moment include dramas like Casualty and repeats of ancient comedies like Blackadder.And on TV tonight, while ITV has us swooning at Love Island, the BBC will be airing Holby City, Springwatch and… more repeats – this time of Live At The Apollo. Yawn.While these shows may be popular with older audiences, it’s clear that there just isn’t much there for young people.When you can stream a library of millions of shows on a laptop or tablet, it feels a bit backwards to sit down and subject yourself to a TV schedule which someone  has decided for you.Of course, it would be unfair to say that the BBC doesn’t do anything right. Fleabag, Killing Eve and Bodyguard have all proved to be very popular.But the question is: why do we all have to pay for these shows evenwe have no intention of watching them While BBC viewers are forced by law to fork out £. per year for the privilege of owning a TV, Netflix customers can pay as little as £. per year to access an ever-growing library of top-tier tele.Amazon Prime Video is similarly priced at £ per year, while Now TV will set you back £.. Sky is more expensive, but you can still find packages for £ per month.It’s no wonder that Brits are turning away from the Beeb, with nearly a million of us cancelling our licence fees every year in favour of cheaper alternatives.Surely a subscription model, like Amazon Prime or Netflix, would be a fairer way to pay for BBC TV.By scrapping the licence fee for everyone, we could force the BBC – supposedly a public service broadcaster – to actually serve the public.Until then, I’ll stick to Netflix.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory leadership hopeful put forward his unusual plan as part of a wide-ranging speech on his vision of Britain. He said: I would have one simple question put above every desk of every civil servant in this country which is aposwould you be proud to put your mother or your brother or yourself in this hospital, in this school, in this prison. Would you be proud to bring someone from another country and say aposThis is Britain, this is the way that we do things in this country, do you feel a sense of pride or do you feel a sense of shameapos. Launching his leadership bid at a circus tent on Londonaposs South Bank, the wildcard candidate promised to walk throughout the UK listening to peopleaposs concern as PM. Mr Stewart has spent the majority of his campaign holding impromptu question sessions with members of the public. Despite trying to stay away from personal attacks the International Development Secretary couldnapost resist a series of jibes at the frontrunner Boris Johnson.  He questioned whether Mr Johnson as PM would the right person to give orders to the commanders of Britainaposs nuclear strike force. Asked about Mr Johnson, Mr Stewart said he had spoken to Conservative Party associations across the UK stating: When you ask them, do you really - and I donapost want to make this too personal - do you really feel that this is the person that you want engaging with the detail and the future of your health and education system  Is this the person that you want writing the instructions to the nuclear submarines  Is this the person that you want embodying the nation on the world stage and guiding you through the most dficult choice that Britain has faced for  years     I trust the Conservative members to arrive at the correct answers. Mr Stewart attacked leadership rivals advocating a no-deal Brexit, accusing them of peddling fairy stories. It is not just no to a deal. It is no to everything. It is no to Europe, it is no to trade, it is no to Parliament, it is no to reality. We are not a aposnoapos country, he said. Underlying all these stories that the other candidates are putting forward that masquerade as optimism is a failure - a failure to grasp reality. What they are giving you is fairy stories. Theyaposre giving you exactly what I read every evening to my two-year-old and four-year-old in bedIaposm ever released from parliament in time and itaposs always the same story. Sometimes the villain is The Gruffalo at this particular moment in time the villain appears to be the elites and the establishment in Europe but the story is the same. The story is there is some benighted victim, there is some great scapegoat whoaposs responsible for all our ills and thereaposs some secret, magical path which youaposre going to be led on through this great prophet whoaposs going to lead you to the uplands but this prophet is not a real prophet, it is a prophet of negativity, it is a prophet of the no, it is the great word of all the  prophets through the ages.  Because the way that you change the world is being honest to the way the world is. But despite his opposition to no-deal, he stopped short of backing Labouraposs plans to stop a future Tory leader allowing the UK to crash out without a deal. Mr Stewart said: I am entirely against no deal. I am entirely against prorogation. I havenapost read the details of this. My instinct is I would be wholly supportive of a move that tried to do that.Labour have tabled a cross-party vote to stop no deal by spearheading a plan which would hand control of the Commons agenda to MPs. They believe it would prevent a future Prime Minister suspending Parliament to force through a no deal  Brexit  against the wishes of MPs.After reading the plans Mr Stewart, who would have faced a huge backlash from Tories for voting with the opposition, tweeted that he could not back them. Mr Stewart is the most pro-Remain candidate left in the race after second referendum supporter Sam Gyimah quit as he did not have enough support. The former prisons minister also floated the idea of a Brexit Assembly of citizens to break the parliamentary deadlock on EU withdrawal. “People are asking why I wish to take up this poison chalice. But it is exactly now when we have to make a choice, a choice of two dferent paths for our country. In a swipe at campaign speeches made by his fellow leadership contenders, Mr Stewart, said he did not believe in the  £ billion of tax cuts that had been promised . He said: The energy to change this country is also about conviction. In the end the problem with a lot of these candidates is that it feels as though their policies have been generated either from a think tank or some kind of focus group. But when I say I want this country to be fairer, greener and more united, it is because I feel these things. Speaking of his green credentials he added: I began to love this country through the soil. The reason I want to plant m more trees is that I myself have planted , trees. He added: Leadership is about listening, leadership is about vision, but above all leadership is about getting things done, it is about doing things, about action. Itaposs not good enough to sit around a table and debate great abstract questions on prison policy when your prison is filthy.    My project in the end is fundamentally just about one thing, itaposs about moderation, itaposs about compromise. The theme is in the end we have much much more in common that ides us, we have to live together, we know that weaposre split on all these dferent issues.  We knowwe listen to each other and begin to think we find we have much more respect for each other, much more capacity to compromise with each other than we could ever imagine. In all these places I have been talking to people what comes to me again and again is the energy of the British people. In the end weaposre bound together because we experience together, the same frustrations.  "},{"url":null,"title":"nao demands urgent improvements food","story":"NewsNational Audit Office demands food safety improvements just months before BrexitFood regulation is showing signs of strain, it has been warnedShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRegulation to ensure food safety in the UK is showing signs of strain as local authorities cut staff and delay hygiene checks, a spending watchdog has found.Experts said it was particularly bad as Brexit was set to lead to further challenges for the system.Spending on food hygiene by local authorities fell by an estimated % between - and - because of funding pressures, the National Audit Officesaid. This is despite the potential for catastrophic consequences from safety failures.The Food Standards Agencytold the watchdog it was struggling to progress its reforms because of the impact of Brexit on the parliamentary timetable - of particular concern because new trading patterns could increase the risk of food safety incidents. The FSA spent £. million of its budget on Brexit preparations and received £ million of additional funding, and had built its capacity to deal with food incidentsthe UK loses access to EU systems and networks.  But the NAO said it had not seen evidence of joined-up strategic thinking about the level of funding needed for a sustainable system to protect UK consumers from future food risks, and how much local authorities and businesses should contribute. Gareth Davies, the new head of the NAO, said: The regulatory system is showing signs of strain with fewer food control staff in local authorities and delays in the checks they carry out on food businesses. This is at a time when the regulatory system faces increased challenges, particularly as we move towards new trading relationships after the UK leaves the EU. Cuts to food hygiene and standards staff had led to some local authorities failing to meet their legal responsibilities to ensure businesses comply with the law, the report said. Less than half the food standards checks due between  and  to ensure products were as described took place over this period. Nevertheless, most food businesses were meeting hygiene requirements, and levels of major food-borne illnesses had been broadly stable. The NAO said consumers needed better information about the food they eat, with only % of food businesses in England displaying hygiene ratings in their premises. The public also remained unclear about the information outlets should provide on allergens in their products.    Around one million people in the UK suffer an illness from food each year, potentially costing £ billion in loss of earnings, hospital admissions and the impact on inidual well-being. The s bovine spongorm encephalopathycrisis cost the UK an estimated £. billion. Pressure on the regulatory system came amid increased challenges as the UK moves towards new trading relationships as it leaves the EU, the NAO found. Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: Food regulation, which is critical to ensuring food is safe, is under pressure. Worryingly some local authorities are failing to meet their statutory duties to ensure that food businesses comply with food laws and, more widely, the regulatory system is struggling to keep up with the pace of change. Consumers are being let down by a lack of information on the food they eat. It is not good enough that almost half of English businesses do not display ratings in their premises. The FSA must take urgent action, including to address the gaps in its ability to assess compliance with food safety standards and to ensure preparedness for dferent scenarios following Brexit. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the Local Government Associationaposs Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said councils had lost p out of every £ they had from government to spend on services since . He said: These signicant funding cuts are affecting all council services - which include trading standards budgets and staffing being cut by around half since  - and undoubtedly make it extremely dficult for some councils to maintain previous levels of food work, given the competing demands of areas such as social care, childrenaposs services and homelessness. The NAO is right that there is a pressing need for government to come up with a sustainable funding model for food regulation, and for other vital areas of regulation. This either needs to be through businesses meeting the costs of regulation, or through councils being properly funded.

Another benefit claimant, George from Carrickfergus, spoke about his fears of losing his Housing Executive homethe bedroom tax starts to operate in the absence of Stormont mitigation payments next March. I have lived in a house for  years, brought up a family - four children - they have grown up and left and my weaposs gone now and I am in the house on my own and itaposs a house full of memories and when the bedroom tax comes in I will be put out, just put of my home, he said. It will be a big challenge at my age, I am  years old and to be moved out of what was my le, what is my le, and to be put where someone  wants me to live. George, who would face being penalised for two of the three bedrooms in his house, questioned whether there would be a suitable one bedroom apartment for him to live in in Carrick. Are they talking about moving me not only out of my home but out of my town where I was born, my mother was born, her mother was born , he asked. I have four children and they come and stay with me andthey move me to a one bedroom apartment anywhere I canapost have my children come to stay with me, where would I put them  So I am losing my family, not just my home. It isnapost just a house to me, itaposs a home and it has been for  years and all the memories that go with it. Itaposs very insensitive. DUP MP Ian Paisley noted that only % of the Housing Executive stock in Northern Ireland was one bedroom accommodation. There isnapost enough houses to go round in your circumstances, he told George.

It was during the heatwave, so we just thought he was struggling in the heat, Helen, , said. Nik, who works at Lush UK, had Googled his sonaposs symptoms and the search ed something more sinister than mere constipation.It suggested a brain tumour, but then again, thataposs Google for you - you type in your symptoms and it nearly always comes back with cancer, said Nik.In an attempt to cheer up Logan, Nik suggested a baking session, usually one of Loganaposs favourite activities, but his son was completely disinterested. He couldnapost even stand up on a chair and hold on to the side without ending up in tears, remembered Nik. Thataposs when they took him to hospital. The doctor who saw Logan could tell he was a poorly child.    They just had to take a look at him to see something was badly wrong, so they admitted him that night, Nik, from Llandaff, Cardf, said.  Emergency surgery to remove the tumour was carried out three days later in August last year. The mass was diagnosed as Medulloblastoma - a cancerous tumour that usually affects the cerebellum and can spread to the rest of the brain and or the spinal cord. The couple didnapost know it at the time, but that would be the last time they heard Logan speak. He smiled at us, and managed to say mummy and daddy, but he never really spoke again after that, said Helen, who gave birth to Bodhi, a little brother to Logan and Sofie, just twelve days after Loganaposs operation.   A series of complications after the surgery, including meningitis and norovirus, as well as the maximum possible dose of radiotherapy, meant Logan never fully recovered.While the operation to remove the tumour had gone as well as doctors hoped, a second scan three weeks later confirmed the worst. The cancer had ed and this time it had spread. We had another MRI scan done and you could see the shadow of the tumour, said Nik. It was in the void where the tumour had been and it was all around the brain. It was all the way down his spinal cord and there was so much of it, some had dropped off the bottom and was just floating around at the base of his spine.  The couple were faced with an impossible decision. Their son would surely die without continued radiotherapy treatment, yet with it, he would live for maybe a month more. For Helen, one look at the MRI scan convinced her to bring their son home to die in peace. Logan came home on September . Doctors though said he wouldnapost last the week. He gave up his brave fight on October . It was just nine weeks after the original diagnosis and all the while, the family said they were overwhelmed by the support and guidance they received from Noahaposs Ark and Welsh childrenaposs cancer charity LATCH. They were beyond invaluable, from sourcing financial support, to organising us a caravan to get away from after his death, to just being there as someone to vent and cry to, said Nik, who is walking km on the Cotswold Way to raise money for the charity.  Around  children in Wales are diagnosed with brain cancer each year. When you hear that, it doesnapost sound like that many, said Helen. But actually,you think about it, itaposs a whole classroom of kids. Itaposs why the couple are speaking out about Logan, Nik said. They want people to be aware of the symptoms, like persistent headaches, balance problems, sickness or behaviour change and to keep the possibility of brain cancer in the back of their minds. They donapost blame anyone for their sonaposs diagnosis, but they have since delivered posters to the GP surgery which highlight the symptoms of Medulloblastoma. Less than % of cancer funding is used for research into brain cancer, said Helen, who has started collecting recyclable products to raise money for the charity Brain Tumour Research and Support. I am asking people to either let me pick up or send me their discarded baby food pouches and dog and cat food pouches, so I can send them off to raise funds for the charity, she explained. So far, the charity has raised more than £, across the UK from recycling items not usually recycled by councils - enough to fund  days of research into brain tumours.The couple have also set up a Facebook page called  Love from Logan  , where they help spread random acts of kindness in Loganaposs memory.We want people to know about Logan - itaposs a way of keeping him in our le, Helen said. Itaposs a place to share the random acts of kindness carried out in Loganaposs name, so that despite leaving us way too soon he can still spread his love.You can donate to Nikaposs Cotswold Way Challenge for Latch  here  .

Tucked away in the sleepy Cheshire town of Cranford, the Grade II listed cottage is filled full of delights in the style of Belvoir castle. Much like the striking Leicestershire landmark, the opulent property is decked out with the plush velvets and ornate wooden framed furniture. On top of reclaimed oak flooring lie huge heavily piled carpets in creams and dark plums.  Hand painted fixtures and intricately stitched curtains cover the walls and windows. A portrait of a cherub-like figure dances in a sky rendered on the ceiling of the cottageaposs second bedroom. Rightmove property expert Miles Shipside, who helped sell the cottage for £,, said: “It’s very rare that I’m lost for words, but this cottage is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. It’s undoubtedly unique and certainly an acquired taste.  “But whether you’re an admirer of the décor or not, the property is still full of charm and character. Other key features include a wood burning stove, a butler style sink and room for a washing machine. A touch of modern day luxury comes in the form of a jacuzzi and underfloor heating in the bathroom. While not quite in keeping with the theme, the garden continues the extravagant feel with a Mediterranean finish, showcasing red mosaic tiles on the floor, white washed walls and a hand painted muriel.    Estate agent Chris George said: “The property is a throwback to a bygone era, including bespoke, hand-painted wall coverings, custom-designed kitchen and bathroom suites, reclaimed oak flooring and French polished doors. “On the first floor there are two double bedrooms, each with their own exquisite décor, and it has to be said that this cottage really is one of a kind.” With the owners unable or unwilling to install a moat, security comes in the form of a CCTV cameras at the front and back of the property.

And she said it was a trip abroad that proved to be the final turning point. I went away to Disneyland Paris in  and took pictures whilst we were there, but when I looked back at them after we got home, I was disgusted, said Ms Jones, who lives in north Hull. I was wearing a pink jumper in one of the pictures and I looked like a big fat blob with a head poking out in it, and Iaposd also struggled to get onto a few rides whilst I was away because of my size.  It was just so embarrassing when I saw the picture, and I thought, how have I got myself into this state  Iaposve never been slim and have always comfort eaten whether Iaposm happy, sad, bored or celebrating and the smallest Iaposve ever been is a size , but that only lasted for two years and then the weight piled on after I had my first child at , so Iaposve been overweight for most of my le.

Then the day after my partner of two-and-a-half-years left me as he told me he was married and had children. It was a really hard time for me, and then my dad died at Christmas the year after and it was a lot for me to take.

It is on top of five stone she lost through a Slimming World group in Hull with support from the coach, Joanne, and encouragement from friends and family I suffer from anxiety and was very nervous about going to the gym and being judged for my size compared to other people in shape that work out, so I lost the first three stone without exercising but through eating a lot more healthily, reducing my portion sizes and cutting out snacking, said Ms Jones.  Then I started to do a couple of work outs at home, and eventually mustered up the courage to join a local gym.

One moment le was good and busy, filled with my sons and husband, work and our normal family le, the Belfast woman said.    “The next thing the doctor told me he was .% certain I had leukaemia. There were only two days inbetween. I’d no time to get prepared for anything, no time to get used to the idea. I went to hospital thinking all I needed was a blood transfusion for anemia and ended up in the cancer unit for four weeks on chemotherapy. “To be honest, I think I’m still in shock. Like everyone  there’s absolutely no reason why I shouldn’t get cancer, but I’m pretty outraged at it sneaking up on me like that. I’m angry and frustrated and I just want to get better and get back to some sort of normality.

I’d never felt so bad in all my le. I’d never even been in hospital before except when having my babies and here I was fighting for le. My first stint was four weeks of chemo, my last was eight weeks and I wasnapost able to have my children to visit because of the risk of infection.

She said: “My husband Alan and I have sort of become overnight experts in this horrible disease. But it seems like every time we take two steps forward we end up taking one backwards and it’s exhausting.    “When we were told I’d need a stem cell transplant I just assumed it would be pretty straight forward. I’d get my bloods done and get a match. “But the only simple things about stem cell transplants is the way the donor gets tested and then the donation of the stem cells. It’s getting the match that’s the trick. “So now I’m sitting here, finally home for hospital for a while, waiting for my sons to come home from school and knowing that I’m relying on absolute strangers to ensure that I can keep doing this.

And I need a stranger to help that happen for us.    After Sharonaposs brothers were found not to be a match tests began to see whether her friends and family were suitable. Whether they are found to be a match is yet to be seen. “I need an angel, a stranger, someone I’ve never met, never spoken to, or perhaps someone I’ve seen passing by on a bus, spoken to in a shop, or even met in an airport, she said.

One royal source said: “Harry has made no secret of what an influence his mother has been on him. “His trip to Africa comes at a time in his le where he has become a parent himself. “Diana had a great affinity with children and recognised the worth of having boots on the ground could affect change in such an important way. “This is all about wanting to fulfil his mother’s legacy and showing his we and baby son the places that have had the most positive affect on him in his le.”    In  on International Mine Awareness Day, Harry said his mother’s work on banning landmines in the last months of her le “wasn’t universally popular”. He added: “Some believed she had stepped over the line into the arena of political campaigning – but for her this wasn’t about politics it was about people.” Harry said: “She knew she had a big spotlight to shine, and she used it to bring attention on the people that others had forgotten, ignored or were too afraid to support.” Botswana - which Harry has previously described as his ‘second home’ - is has also been suggested as a destination, as well as South Africa. The Queen appointed her grandson one of its youth ambassadors last year and sees him as an important proponent of her legacy. The Sussexes’ advisers are working on a tailored role for the couple with the help of Sir David Manning, a former ambassador to the US, and Lord Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary who chairs the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust.    Sources close to former Prime Minister Tony Blair have also told The Mirror how Harry’s decision could be based on Diana’s plans with the Labour leader to create a bespoke role for her as a roving international peace envoy in the months before she died. In an interview after she died in a Paris tunnel on August ,  Blair said: “She had a tremendous ability, as we saw over the land mines issue...to enter into an area that could have been one of controversies and suddenly just clary for people what was clearly the right thing to do. “I felt there were all sorts of ways that could have been harnessed and used for the good of people.” He added: “Compassion is the best legacy. That is what she was about.” Harry’s first step will be next Monday to attend a Chatham House Africa Programme event on ‘Mine Clearance, Conservation, and Economic Development in Angola’, Buckingham Palace confirmed today. The event is being held in partnership with the HALO Trust, with the Angolan Government about to provide £ million of funding to clear landmines in two national parks, a major opportunity for the conservation of southern Africa’s last great wilderness. The Africa Programme event will highlight the connection between conservation, economic development, and mine clearance, with a call to action for increased funding for mine clearance efforts in Angola.

The Trooping the Colour ceremony saw royal children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and their young brother Louis all celebrate with their grandmother on the famous Buckingham Palace balcony. But some royal fans hoping to see the Royal Familyaposs latest addition, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, were left disappointed as he was nowhere to be seen. Instead, mum Meghan Markle made her first official appearance since baby Archieaposs birth last month alongside hubby Prince Harry.    And this could have been a decision made by the Queen herself, according to a source. Apparently, it is quite likely the the Queen could have thought Archie was too young for the Palace balcony and so decided he should stay at home. Thataposs according to editor in chief of Majesty magazine Ingrid Seward, who told The Sun: “The Queen, through her private secretary, could easily have said Archie was far too young for the Palace balcony, which indeed he is.    “Her view would be that it is an event to be enjoyed by children, but no younger then Prince Louis as they must be able to behave properly. “The last thing she wants is for millions of TV viewers to witness a childhood tantrum.” Baby Archie appears to be following in his cousin Prince Louisaposs footsteps as he also did not make his debut until this year, as he was only a month old at last yearaposs event.  It is also though Archie didnapost attend because the Duke and Duchess of Sussex may not have wanted him to outshine the Queen, according to royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams. He told Fabulous Digital: “It may also have been thought that his appearance, had it been something they did want and this is just a rumour, would have overshadowed the parade. “It would have been the headlines and this was first and foremost the celebration of the Queen’s official birthday.” "},{"url":null,"title":"secret behind whopping 150000 price","story":"NewsSecret behind whopping £, price tag of dilapidated cowshed in need of TLCThe ruined barn is on the edge of a farm in the village of Chapel Amble, CornwallShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsIt has huge potential \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dilapidated cowshed is being sold for a whopping £, - despite it having no front or side walls. The ramshackle outbuilding is in some desperate need of TLC and looks a bit sorry for itself. But it has the potential to be turned into a stunning two bedroom cottagethe right person is willing to fork out the hefty price tag - plus another £, to convert it. The ruined barn, set in a field in Cornwall, has all the appropriate planning permission and is on the edge of a farm in the village of Chapel Amble, which is just five miles from the trendy resort of Rock.  It is also a short drive from the prestigious surfing beach at Polzeath. While the chance to buy property in such a sought-after part of Britain seems reasonably priced, it will cost the new owner at least £, to convert it to plan. Because of this, the project is likely to appeal to somebody wanting a holiday home by the Cornish coast or somebody looking to retire rather than a first time buyer.  Despite its run down appearance, the stone barn is said to be structurally sound. The planning permission allows for a small side extension that will house one of the two bedrooms. Once converted, the property will have an open plan living, kitchen and dining area, one bathroom and the two bedrooms. Jo Ashby, of estate agents John Bray, said: The new owner will be buying a single storey barn conversion project.  What is currently there is an old cowshed that hasnapost been used for a long time and now looks a bit sorry for itself and needs some TLC. But now that planning permission has been secured it can be turned a handsome two bedroom barn conversion with . acres of land. If it is to be a permanent home then it is more likely it will be sold to someone looking to retire to the area rather than a first time buyer.  While the price of £, might look affordable on paper, the reality is that it will cost a lot of money to do the work. But it could quite easily sell to someone wanting a second home in the area. The property is on edge of a field but it does have its own access along a quiet lane but services like drainage and gas will need to be installed.

Some . million OAPs learned this week they would be stripped of the £.-a-year perk. The bombshell dropped when the corporation – which would have faced a £million annual bill to maintain the concession – said only over-s who receive pension credit will be eligible from June . Currently all households with someone aged  or over are entitled to a free licence. But the universal perk was doomed when the Tories stitched up a deal in  for the corporation to take on the burden of funding the licences.    Mr Whittingdale told MPs: “When the decision was taken it was understood that this would be a possible outcome, not least because to maintain the existing concession would cost the BBC nearly £billion by the end of the charter period, which would mean either huge programme cuts or increasing the licence fee for the under-s to nearly £.” Yet just two years later, the Conservativesapos  election manesto pledged to maintain the benefit for the rest of this Parliament – due to run until . Current Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright faced a huge backlash yesterday when he was hauled into the Commons for a -minute mauling,  hours after the BBC announced free licences would be curbed. Even usually-loyal Tories turned on the Cabinet Minister over the Governmentaposs betrayal. Conservative MP Ed Vaizey was a Culture Minister from  to  when, he said, “the Treasury imposed the policy on the BBC to meet its £billion welfare target”. He told MPs the Government should either take back this policy or support the BBC changes.  Backbench Tory William Wragg said: “The  Conservative manesto contained a number of interesting ideas, some of which it has been more convenient to forget from time to time. “But in this instance it was quite categoric.” He urged the Culture Secretary to “in some way, shape or form ensure that the over-s maintain their free TV licences for the duration of this Parliament”. Fellow Tory backbencher Martin Vickers said the Government was suggesting the “BBC - an outside organisation - has a veto over the Conservative Government delivering on their manesto commitment”. He urged ministers to “ensure the Government carries out its manesto commitment”. Conservative MP Philip Hollobone told the Culture Secretary: “Both you and I were elected on the Conservative manesto which promised pensioners they would retain their free TV licences. “We have already broken one huge manesto commitment to leave the European Union on March  – I suggest we donapost add to that list.” The Mirror is campaigning to save free TV licences, with more than , readers backing the battle by completing coupons in the paper. Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson and former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown have supported the fight.    More than , people have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for the licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility for funding the perk. Facing repeated calls to U-turn, squirming Mr Wright claimed yesterday: “This decision is not for the Government to make any longer, it is for the BBC to make.” But the shameless hand-washing only triggered more angry questions over why the Tories issued their pledge in the  election campaign. Earlier, Veterans Minister Tobias Ellwood, a former Army officer, slammed his own Government for betraying pensioners. “A week after D-Day commemorations these people are going to be facing these bills. I do hope we go back to the drawing board and think what more can we do to look after our veterans,” he told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain. “Let’s look at this again. Let’s recognise the importance that these licence fees have for those, particularly veterans and why it’s so valued.” He added: “Clearly there was an indication from Government that we had a commitment to make sure the licence fee remained free.”    Tory leadership hopeful Andrea Leadsom said the plan to charge over-s was “unacceptable”. She said: Itaposs a commitment in the Conservativesapos manesto and we need to find a way to reverse that. Furious Labour MPs lined up to tear into hapless Mr Wright in a brutal Commons showdown. Labouraposs Deputy Leader Tom Watson, the Shadow Culture Secretary, said voters had discovered “just how little a Tory manesto promise is worth”. He fumed: “No s, no buts, no wavering - a promise made in  to voters by the Conservative Party. “Today, . million over-s find that promise in tatters. They have been betrayed, and it is shameful. The Government have the breathtaking gall to blame the BBC for this mess, but passing the buck will not work. “The BBC is not the Department for Work and Pensions. Public broadcasters should never be responsible for social policy.” Backbencher Wes Streeting, who sits on the Commons Treasury Committee, said: “Every single pensioner in the country will know that the Tories made a promise in their manesto which they could not keep and never intended to keep.” MP Julie Cooper said pensioners would wonder “how can they trust a word the Conservative Government say ever again”. She added: “The Conservatives’ manesto was very clear: they committed to protecting free TV licences for all over-s.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uni lecturer stuck old peoples","story":"NewsUni lecturer stuck in old peoples home at age of just  due to rare illnessDr Sophie Williams, a Bangor University lecturer, wasnt expected to survive after being struck down with Japanese encephalitis four years agoShareCommentsByMari Jones:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsDr Sophie Williams of Bangor University \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA university lecturer has had to live in an old peopleaposs home for the past six months at the age of just .

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress.

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay.

My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

This has been in fact, the beneficial case for centuries through many obvious examples with the formation of our strong and interdependent United Kingdom. I consider that Scottish nationalist independence sympathisers, learning from this, are now trying to reverse the process to meet their own separatist ends.I view supporters of the re-introduction of Gaelic after many centuries to areas where Lallans or Lowland Scots was, and indeed to some extent still is, the spoken form of English are being hoodwinked. Considering that only one per cent of the Scottish population can speak Gaelic, I am convinced that the drive to spread it in signage cannot be anything other than political subterfuge.Scotland should be celebrating its cultural ersity through extending the use of Urdu, Cantonese, Polish and so forth ndash not trying to rewrite history through a disregard for the Auld Scots tongue.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT is only toward the end of Stephen Kerr and Luke Grahamrsquos endorsement of Michael Govethat we learn their primary aimndash that all the proposed changes are to act as ldquoa bulwark against nationalism by bringing people together in collaboration.Collaboration is of course a ldquogood thing, but the dficulty with it is the basis on which it takes place, and certainly notit is compelled. Regarding the UK, it could be based on a Union of nations, or \"one nation, one vote\", in which case the current bourach that is Brexit would have been avoided. The dficulty of course, is that this would have meant  per cent of the UKdictating to the other  per cent . Instead decisions are taken by representation in the House of Commons, which is almost  per cent from one partner to the Union, England.In  of the  elections since  Scotland voted for the ldquowinning party, but eight of those  were before . Of the eight where Scotland voted for a party other than that which took power at Westminster, no fewer than six have been of the  elections since . I think this is a clear indication of a signicant and growing political dference between Scotland and the rest of the UK, which must surely be a major challenge to the Union.The UKrsquos main response has been to get the Supreme Court yo reaffirm, lest we forget, the sovereignty of the House of Commons. This makes Messrs Graham and Kerrrsquos support for collaboration seem even more hollow, when the House of Commons is not only sovereign but utterly dominated by one part of the Union. The United Kingdom increasingly is being exposed as an unbalanced and unequal political entity that warm words, such as ldquocollaboration, ldquocompassionate, and ldquoco-operative Union are increasingly incapable of concealing. The problem is not only one of attitudes, perceptions or even policies, but of the very structure of a Union dominated to the degree it is by a one part.Nor is the gap restricted to voting behaviour, as on almost every index of economic well-being ndash GDP per capita, economic growth, employment rates and so on ndash London and the south-east are often so far ahead that it is not uncommon for these regions to be the only two with scores better than the UK average. This economic imbalance has not only existed for many years but has accelerated in the last  or  years. Governments have come and gone making the same arguments about ldquo[delivering] for Scotland and the entire United Kingdom to ldquopromote and realise the benefits of the Union in every aspect of government at every level, but actually changing very little. How much credence can we place on Messrs Graham and Kerrrsquos claim that things will be dferent this time, but onlythe , members of the Conservative Partyelect Michael Gove Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.IF the SNP does not like the idea of taxation levels being higher in Scotland than England then why does it not reduce taxation here too . Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has tried to increase the tax take from Scots by raising taxes and all the signs are that it will actually reduce overall tax take. Land and Building Transaction Tax has shown the way that ill-thought-out tax rises are counter-productive.The SNP has concentrated for too long on trying to narrow the \"attainment gap\" by simply redistributing wealth. This is unsustainable. The only way to close the attainment gap is through growth and productivity. The problem is this avenue has effectively been shut off by SNP zeal to be a \"world leader\" in climate change policies.Boris Johnson is simply exposing the true SNP position, that of being out of its depth. All the SNP can do is claim \" outrage\" and \"independence now\" when the actual answer is to reassess its own taxation policies.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.THE SNP rightly castigates Boris Johnson for his tax plans to \"give awayrsquorsquo to the rich.But with the lack of irony and hypocrisy that is now endemic to the party, the SNP fails to mention its own contributions to the pockets of the rich and super-rich in Scotland. Baby boxes free prescriptions scrapping of bridge tolls, we could go on and on. The goodies on offer were not targeted on the poor.

Drivers should ensure their vehicles are road worthy at all times and not just when it comes to MOT time. “We will continue to give attention to the A as well as other roads in the North East.” data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jill accepting the award\"  Director picks up awardviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Bam Nuttall will carry out the work on the new Kintore Station\"  Firm awarded Kintore station contract viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"neighbours object to brewdog s inverurie pub hours","story":"Neighbours of BrewDog#s newly-opened bar in Inverurie have raised objections to their formal premises licence.The brewery is seeking the green light to continue operating from am to midnight Sunday to Thursday and from am to am Friday and Saturday.It also wants to continue providing off-sales from am to pm Monday to Sunday.Aberdeenshire Central Licensing Board will debate the application on Wednesday, June .It will hear from two residents who have questioned the need for the ‘Heart of Hops’ premises to trade until am at a weekend.One neighbour, who stays just metres away from the bar’s outside seating area, says: “We feel that the opening hours till am are unacceptable due to noise which will carry to our home.“We were under the impression that closing time would be the normal pm.”Another questions how the outdoor area will be effectively managed to avoid neighbourhood disturbance.Licensing standards officers have recommended restricted use of the outdoor area and that it should not be used until noon daily and close by pm Sunday to Thursday and pm on a Friday and Saturday.After a - vote back in April, the licensing board narrowly paved the way for the pub’s opening last month despite BrewDog not possessing a provisional licence.It took the highly unusual step of granting two occasional licences to enable it to trade from the former Mitchell’s Dairy premises on Market Street.BrewDog retail director James Brown told the board the firm had made “a huge commitment to Inverurie and Aberdeenshire” and afterwards said he was “delighted” with the decision.Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing, stressed at the time that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Kintore Primary School\"  Speed limit backed outside schoolviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Peterhead Household Waste and Recycling Centre\"  New measures proposed to increase recycling viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"She said: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.

While some HRCs are licensed to take trade waste, some businesses dispose of or recycle their waste asit was domestic waste, therefore not paying for their commercial waste to be disposed of. As well as taking up space meant for local householders’ recyclable materials and causing congestion at facilities, it also has legal and financial implications. Steps to tackle the issue are being proposed to each of the Council’s Area Committees to allow local councillors to give feedback, prior to final consideration by the Infrastructure Services Committee. It follows agreement on a new waste strategy for the area in January, designed to push up recycling rates and send less materials to landfill. Currently, as much as % of the waste taken to recycling centres is thought to be business waste, which should not be there.Disposal of business waste by these means is thought to be costing Aberdeenshire taxpayers around £, a year – money which could be better spent improving recycling services for households. Businesses would be prevented from using HRCs and instead directed to use council waste transfer stations at Banchory, Ellon and Macduff.At these facilities materials can be accurately weighed and charged for appropriately. As it is around half the cost to recycle materials than to landfill them, this gives businesses an incentive to consider which materials have the potential to be erted from landfill.This approach would also make it fairer to those businesses which already dispose of their waste through a paid-for collection service or by paying for the waste they take to recycling centres. To try to ensure businesses cannot continue to use HRCs unlawfully, a vehicle permit system is being proposed. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"BrewDogs Inverurie bar\"  Neighbours object to BrewDog’s Inverurie pub hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Staff from Johnston Carmichael at the Aberdeen Kiltwalk\"  Firm goes extra mile for charities viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses would not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailers and vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Under the proposals householders who use commercial type vehicleswould be able to apply for free permits to access HRCs. Households would apply for the free permits in advance and a year’s supplywould be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “The majority of households will not be affected by the proposed permit system as those using cars, MPVs, xs or hire vans would continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.“The permit system is simply designed to address the fact that some households use commercial type vehicles – we understand this and they will be able to use the services in the same way as other members of their community, with a permit which shows staff they are entitled. “In the past we have seen situations where staff are put in a dficult position where they suspect someone disposing of materials at an HRC is linked to a business but cannot prove this. “The permit system will avoid any confusion and will make it perfectly clear that only household materials are permitted to be disposed of at our HRCs.“It is also really important that businesses take disposal costs into account when charging for work, paying appropriately for the waste they create. Following recent public engagement on budget setting, we know many residents agree with this approach that the council should not subsidise businesses. It is not for the taxpayer to pick up this bill on their behalf, hence these proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"speed limit backed outside school","story":"Local councillors have supported a motion calling for a part-time mph limit to be made permanent outside Kintore School.Members of the Garioch Area Committee made the decision after its chair Fergus Hood warned the matter “could not wait until a child has been run down” before action was taken.Cllr Hood – along with fellow members Glen Reid and Martin Ford –jointly raised a Members Promoted Issue after local residents raised serious concerns over “signicant speeding” outside the school.By introducing a permanent mph zone – which is against current council policy – it would create the mechanism to have additional traffic-calming measures such as a single speed hump to be installed directly outside the school.Despite admitting that recent recorded speeds during the part-time mph were above the threshold for interventions, roads officials said a full-time mph limit did not meet council criteria.Instead they wanted to see a high-profile enforcement campaign by Police Scotland and greater engagement with the school parent council, parents and local community groups on driving behaviour.A report stated: “There is existing traffic calming in the area that is appropriate for the type of road and includes traffic islands, build-outs, flashing speed limit signage, zebra crossing and a part-time mph limit.”Cllr Reid told the committee that there was clear evidence of “horrendous speeding” on the m stretch of road.Cllr Martin Ford felt the local authority appeared to be “too tolerant” of speeding, insisting that it needed to be more pro-active to get speeds down generally.The motion will be raised at the council’s Infrastructure Service Committee.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police appeal after thefts from Aberdeenshire propertiesviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"BrewDogs Inverurie bar\"  Neighbours object to BrewDog’s Inverurie pub hours viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmFollowing a revised offer from Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, and subsequent consultation with reps, Prospect air traffic controllers are to be balloted on whether or not to accept a new pay offer.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mrs May said: ldquoAs the first country to legislate for long-term climate targets, we can be truly proud of our record in tackling climate change.ldquoNow is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children.ldquoStanding by is not an option. Reaching net zero by  is an ambitious target, but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations.The Government said it would retain the ability to use international carbon credits, which allow the UK to pay to offset its emissions where in the world. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Any remaining pollution would have to be offset by measures such as planting trees under the move--Committee on Climate Change chairman Lord Deben said he was delighted the Government was putting the net zero target to a parliamentary vote and was looking forward to cross-party consensus on the issue.ldquoThis is a major commitment for the coming decades, but we have highlighted the signicant benefits of action.ldquoThis is just the first step. The target must now be reinforced by credible UK policies, across government, inspiring a strong response from business, industry and society as a whole.Lord Deben also said the Government had not yet formally included international aviation and shipping in the targets, but had acknowledged they needed to be part of the strategy.Shadow energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: ldquoWhile this announcement is welcome in theory, in practice it comes from a Conservative government that is off track to meet existing climate targets, that has no plans for legislation or investment needed to cut emissions, and that has dismantled the UK renewable energy sector while pushing fracking.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of business group the CBI, said UK companies were ldquosquarely behind the commitment.She said: ldquoThis legislation is the right response to the global climate crisis, and firms are ready to play their part in combating it.ldquoClimate leadership can drive UK competitiveness and secure long-term prosperity.Letrsquos not mince words,  is a death sentence: people are already dying and this will only get worse with far off dates. Were we to put our minds to it to address the threat, the UK could embrace transformative change and decarbonise in years not decades.https:t.co WKeDxRMKmdash Extinction Rebellion ####June , Gareth Redmond King, head of climate change at the environmental charity WWF, said the announcement was a ldquocrucial first step.He said: ldquoIf we want future generations to live on a viable planet where the mass extinctions wersquore witnessing halt, food security is ensured and coastal regions are safe, then Government must accelerate policies and commit resource to slashing emissions, heat our homes with clean energy and make climate action a priority across all departments.Extinction Rebellion, the protest group that brought parts of London to a standstill with demonstrations in April, said the target is ldquonot nearly enough.ldquoLetrsquos not mince words,  is a death sentence: people are already dying and this will only get worse with far off dates, the group said.copy -.

The report is extremely comprehensive and one area of recommendations drew my attention. It was about using mediation and giving people mediation skills to help ­facilitate dficult conversations which could make a big impact in helping to change the culture of NHS Highland into one which deals ­positively with conflict.One of the key findings of the report was that once people take their ­conflict into disciplinary and grievance procedures, that prolongs the disputes and prevents the sorts of conversations which,heard at an earlier stage, might allow issues to be resolved earlier. It can also have an effect on future relationships, ­people’s confidence, mental health and well-being and ultimately how NHS Highland, or indeed any other organisation, s.The other big impact would be that which comes from embracing ­conflict and understanding the positive effect that constructive and respectful dialogue have in improving organisations, in the case of NHS Highland, its ability to serve the health needs of the population.The report argues that early intervention, either through mediation of facilitated discussion would create a space where people would have an opportunity to ‘see the other’s point of view’, ‘share perspectives’ and do so in a way where blame isn’t the issue.In my experience where agreement is made in mediation it tends to be ‘stuck to’ as people have been the architects of their own­ ­agreement and it hasn’t been something ­perceived to have been imposed upon them. Such processes may also give people who have raised issues more of a feeling that they have been ­listened to, as a key part of mediation is the ­exploration of concerns and getting to bottom of what ­people need.It is not uncommon for organisations to have trained internal mediators. Such mediators cannot all come from HR and are usually best spread throughout an organisation. In the case of NHS Highland it should be possible to deploy internal mediators who will be independent and seen to be independent. In certain cases perhaps an agreement with another NHS board could be in place to reciprocally share mediators or,needed, hire ­someone external to the organisation. The report suggests that this could be done on a cross public sector basis in the Highlands, which makes a lot of sense.The report also suggests the need to equip people to conduct skilled facilitation. There is a strong crossover with the skills mediators use and such a development would compliment the introduction of mediation.The report references how ­internal culture can impact on the outward facing culture and how complaints from patients are dealt with. I think that’s an important correlation and one worth pursuing. Scottish Mediation are currently working in partnership with the Scottish Government Healthcare Improvement Directorate to deliver conflict skills seminars to complaint handlers across health boards in Scotland. That work is designed to help facilitate better conversations with complainants so that ultimately complaints are resolved and perhaps, just as importantly, that the learning is taken from the issues and ­situations raised.That work also supports a scheme whereby NHS complaints can be mediated. More recently we have had requests for mediators to facilitate meetings . ­Participants have said to us that it has helped them to reach agreements they didn’t think possible and that the safe space within which to have an open and respectful discussion has been invaluable. Even where agreement hasn’t been reached, the ability to air the issues has helped parties to better understand each other and why they hold their particular views.All of the above leads me to believe that there is a massive potential to both use mediation and to reap the benefits from spreading the skills of mediation. The benefits will not just be for those involved in a mediation or facilitated discussion but for ­other members of staff working in a ­better work environment. Patients can also benefit from a collaborative working environment and ­ultimately from less time spent on resolving disputes. This is a strong case for preventative spend.Graham Boyack, director, ­Scottish Mediation.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"martyn mclaughlin why the waverley paddle steamer must be saved","story":"There are few viewpoints more spectacular than the Free French Memorial on Greenock#s Lyle Hill, where a sprawling housing estate gives way to a sweeping panorama which rivals any in Britain for the majesty of its composition. Here, in a town trademarked by its cantilever cranes and red-bricked rows of warehouses, nature reasserts her authority as the yawning expanse of the Firth of Clyde is foreshadowed by Gourock and framed by the rolling hills of Kilcreggan and Dunoon. It is an outlook which only improves during the summer months, and not on account of the erratic west coast weather the enhancement is provided entirely by the reassuring sight of the Waverley’s raked twin funnels coming into view, as she chugs down past the Tail O’ The Bank. From a distance, she appears a mere speck in the Clyde’s dull leaden-blue waters, almost insignicant against the grand canvas provided by Tom na h-Airidh and Ben Bowie. Yet all it takes for the roles to be reversed is a simple change of perspective. Stepping aboard the Waverley is to enter a world of sensory delights, a world which renders all outside it small and insignicant. Vast piston rods and cranks chatter away in unison, thrumming deep below right up against the soles of your feet. Above deck, a churn of gulls hangs expectantly over a comforting fug of hot oil and cold beer. She reserves the best, however, for when she is in full flow, as the unrelenting rhythm of her paddles scoop through the sea, an unstoppable force of industrial ingenuity thrashing ever forward through the years. Or so we hoped. The world’s last seagoing paddle steamer has been a fondly received visitor to communities scattered throughout Scotland’s western waterways for decades. When Caledonian MacBraynesensed that the days of folk heading “doon the watter” were numbered, they sold her in  for £to the Scottish branch of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society. No doubt there are some within CalMac who came to regret that decision, but equally, it would be a mistake to mock them for some perceived folly. The Waverley had lost several sailing days the previous two summer season to boiler problems, and the commercial case for her continued service was increasingly dficult to justy. CalMac, mindful of the ship’s heritage, presumed the society would tend to her in her dotage as a static attraction. Here we are, some  years and six million passengers later. The question in  is, having performed one resurrection, can she repeat the trick The boiler problems which troubled the grand old lady back then, and sporadically ever since,are now altogether more grave. The inner casings of the vast, oil-filled structures are damaged beyond repair. Their replacement is a process the steamship’s custodians liken to “open heart surgery,” and it will be expensive to boot. Waverley Steam Navigation Co Ltd, the charity set up to preserve the ship in operating condition, is hoping to raise £ million so that she canto service next summer. As Paul Semple, the general manager, concedes, it will be a “signicant struggle”. And yet for all the strain of the annual upkeep costs in the face of rising fuel costs and a stricter regulatory environment, there is undoubtedly a sound economic argument to ensure the Waverley stays afloat for years to come. The charity points out that the Waverley’s visits throughout Scotland, as well as to England and Wales, generates more than £.m for the UK economy each year. It is an impressive figure, and its real value lies in where the money goes. By virtue of the Waverley’s long-established routes to Scotland’s islands and sea lochs, she and her patrons call at small, rural communities which once thrummed with activity in their Victorian summer heydays. The Waverley alone cannot turn back the clock and fully restore their lustre, but when she arrives at one their piers teeming with  hungry and thirsty punters onboard, it is a cheering sight for local businesses. Just ask the staff in the Golfers, one of Rothesay’s great wee howffs, who can barely pull pints quickly enough to meet the demand as the tourists come ashore or those in the bustling Zaoni’s chippy, just a hop, skip, and stagger away from the boozer — ideal for those Waverley apostles in pursuit of the last fish supper before their beloved steamer sets sail for Glasgow. Of course, there are some who believe the Waverley’s proud heritage could be preserved without the expense and exertion of rendering her seaworthy once more. Those who envisage her as a floating visitor attraction would do well to look to Calornia, where the Queen Mary has been allowed to fester and decay under the watch of reckless municipal landlords. But the argument for permanently mooring the Waverley is built on deeper fault lines. It singularly fails to acknowledge how the only reason the ship is still with us at all is due to the hard work of generations of impassioned volunteers who simply refused to countenance the idea that the blast of her steam whistle would fall silent..We can, and should, rattle some cages to save an icon of Scotland’s maritime heritage, but it is a battle that will be easier won by remembering the Waverley is no museum piece. Her beauty lies in her . She wears her blood, sweat, and oil with pride.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"andrea leadsom would never say never to second scottish independence referendum","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Conservative leadership contender Andrea Leadsom has said she would \"never say never\" to allowing a second Scottish independence referendum, in a signicant break with government policy.The former Leader of the House of Commons said that as a supporter of devolution, she would not want to rule out indyref, but would \"fight against it\" and didnt believe a second referendum should be held.window.twttr But she said a second independence referendum would be \"up for negotiation\".

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three.

In  its final report included “proposed actions” for Ministers to adopt or pursue in order to lessen theeffects of households having to spend more than  per cent of their incomes onheat and light.Housing minister Kevin Stewart told the Free Press thetask force’s report and recommendations have “helped inform the development ofthe Fuel Poverty Bill and draft strategy”, alongside other signicantstakeholder engagement, including the first ever Islands Communities ImpactAssessment.He added: “Scotland is one of the few countries in theworld to define fuel poverty and set a goal towards eradicating it. By changingthe definition of fuel poverty so it’s more closely aligned to relative incomepoverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and islandcommunities, we are ensuring our support is focused on those who need it most.”A spokeswoman for Mr Stewart also said that “tacklingand prioritising extreme fuel poverty” – where households have to spend over per cent of their income on heat and light – was the first priority of the newBill. New definitions of both fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty arecurrently being worked on.She added: “Our proposals in the Fuel Poverty Billwill align fuel poverty more closely with low income. Scotland is among only ahandful of European countries to define fuel poverty, let alone set targets relatingto its eradication. Our proposal to use the Minimum Income Standard isimportant and innovative and more closely aligns fuel poverty with low income.The UK Minimum Income Standard, used in the new definition of fuel poverty inthe Fuel Poverty Bill, takes account of the additional costs associated withliving in remote and island communities by applying an uplt for remote ruralareas and remote small towns, and, separately for island areas.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"total rematch for a night in november","story":"AUGUST  and the curtain came up on Marie Jones’ A Night in November, making its theatrical debut as part of Féile an Phobail.  years on and the play is back, detailing one man’s struggle with identity at the Lyric Theatre.The play charts the story of welfare clerk Kenneth McAllister, a Protestant who has always followed the rules and has “cleanly discriminated” against Catholics throughout his le. This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

news northern-ireland article.ece cb AUTOCROP h bpanews_eaef-cb--aec-abdd_embeddedEmailThe sheer scale of the problems facing Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been laid bare in a new report.Commissioned by the Department for the Economy, it warns that businesses here would be left with \"limited room for manoeuvre\" should the UK leave without an agreement.The report, compiled by EU customs and international trade lawyers, provides a \"sobering reflection\" on the issues that would arise for cross-border trade.\"In particular, it confirms the Northern Ireland Civil Services concern about the impact of EU tarfs on food exports toIreland, and the ability of micro and small enterprises with no experience in customs procedures and operations to continue to export to Ireland,\" a cover note to the report said.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will cease to have a legal or regulatory framework in which to trade with the EU.It will instead fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, meaning UK-EU trade would suddenly be subject to tarfs on some goods and new disruptive non-tarf barriers, resulting in a logistical nightmare.In  over % of businesses here that exported to the rest of the EU were trading across the border.The total value of this trade was £.bn, which represented % of all exports and % of external sales, which includes sales to Britain.In  imports from the Republic totalled £.bn while % of all local businesses exporting south of the border are micro or small enterprises, which would be hit hard by no-deal.Among the recommendations, the report suggests negotiations could be commenced to establish joint Republic of Ireland Northern Ireland customs offices in each others territory.\"If an integrated logistics centre customs office is established, the joint customs office can also be located there, thus signicantly increasing efficiency,\" the report said.\"UK Government should concentrate on developing and implementing its own single window for lodging all import, export and transit requirements and should enter into consultation with the Republic in its efforts to establish its own.\"The medium-term objective should be to create as much efficiency as possible on each side of the border by aligning the single windows in their presentation and ality, thus signicantly increasing efficiency.\"Even with that, there would be further complications depending on what type of goods, livestock, food are being exported or imported.The report also looked at the potential for establishing logistics centres where integrated customs and technology dealing with commercial traffic could be installed, though it warned this would be a long-term project and would be extremely costly to both sides of the border.\"Technological solutions, in so far as they exist, can help to speed the clearance process,\" the report added.\"Consideration could be given to the financial burdens small SMEs in particular will incurthey need to acquire the equipment for such solutions.\"Lorries or containers of such traders could be made identiable by number plate recognition or a tracking device.\"Another recommendation is that the UK could grant waivers or reductions in time-limits for lodging declarations for low-risk products crossing the border, which would be helpful for deliveries on short notice.\"It can be expected that traders will find the rules and procedures to be extremely complex and confusing,\" it added.\"The administrative effort on the part of the UK authorities or authorised bodies to issue certicates, licences etc. will be signicant and likely result in delays.\"The department also warned that the creation of a hard customs border \"could jeopardise the peace which has been established by the Belfast Agreement and the Common Travel Area\".\"However, there is nothing to prevent co-ordinated action between the UK and the EU RoI to protect respective and or mutual security interests,\" it said."},{"url":null,"title":"masked vigilantes on streets of derry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9967081.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South West College studying BTEC Level  Diploma in Business completed their final pitches last week in front of a  of lsquoDragonsrsquo.A Dragonsrsquo Den simulated task was the concluding element of a yearlong project that required them to develop inidual business ideas, conduct market research, and compose financial forecasts.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Traffic delays as emergency services at scene of accident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs May said: ldquoAs the first country to legislate for long-term climate targets, we can be truly proud of our record in tackling climate change.ldquoNow is the time to go further and faster to safeguard the environment for our children.ldquoStanding by is not an option. Reaching net zero by  is an ambitious target, but it is crucial that we achieve it to ensure we protect our planet for future generations.The Government said it would retain the ability to use international carbon credits, which allow the UK to pay to offset its emissions where in the world. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Any remaining pollution would have to be offset by measures such as planting trees under the move  --Committee on Climate Change chairman Lord Deben said he was delighted the Government was putting the net zero target to a parliamentary vote and was looking forward to cross-party consensus on the issue.ldquoThis is a major commitment for the coming decades, but we have highlighted the signicant benefits of action.ldquoThis is just the first step. The target must now be reinforced by credible UK policies, across government, inspiring a strong response from business, industry and society as a whole.Lord Deben also said the Government had not yet formally included international aviation and shipping in the targets, but had acknowledged they needed to be part of the strategy.Shadow energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: ldquoWhile this announcement is welcome in theory, in practice it comes from a Conservative government that is off track to meet existing climate targets, that has no plans for legislation or investment needed to cut emissions, and that has dismantled the UK renewable energy sector while pushing fracking.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of business group the CBI, said UK companies were ldquosquarely behind the commitment.She said: ldquoThis legislation is the right response to the global climate crisis, and firms are ready to play their part in combating it.ldquoClimate leadership can drive UK competitiveness and secure long-term prosperity.Letrsquos not mince words,  is a death sentence: people are already dying and this will only get worse with far off dates. Were we to put our minds to it to address the threat, the UK could embrace transformative change and decarbonise in years not decades.https:t.co WKeDxRMKmdash Extinction Rebellion ####June , Gareth Redmond King, head of climate change at the environmental charity WWF, said the announcement was a ldquocrucial first step.He said: ldquoIf we want future generations to live on a viable planet where the mass extinctions wersquore witnessing halt, food security is ensured and coastal regions are safe, then Government must accelerate policies and commit resource to slashing emissions, heat our homes with clean energy and make climate action a priority across all departments.Extinction Rebellion, the protest group that brought parts of London to a standstill with demonstrations in April, said the target is ldquonot nearly enough.ldquoLetrsquos not mince words,  is a death sentence: people are already dying and this will only get worse with far off dates, the group said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK to set legally binding target for net zero emissions by  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
