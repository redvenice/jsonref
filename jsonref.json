(Picture Getty)Fifty-six million years ago, the Earth warmed far above the temperatures we experience today – and ice at the poles melted.It sounds like the kind of crackpot conspiracy to be found on ‘ancient alien’ UFO sites, but scientists have seriously investigated the idea.Professor Adam Frank of the University of Rochester writes in The Atlantic that the investigation could offer insight into how to find alien life – or about our impact on our planet.Frank writes, ‘There is a conundrum here. If an earlier species’s industrial activity is short-lived, we might not be able to easily see it.‘The PETM’s spikes mostly show us the Earth’s timescales for responding to whatever caused it, not necessarily the timescale of the cause.Could we be one of several civilisations to have lived on Earth? (Picture Getty)‘So it might take both dedicated and novel detection methods to find evidence of a truly short-lived event in ancient sediments. In other words, if you’re not explicitly looking for it, you might not see it.’Frank says the researchers thought about what our civilisation might leave behind in rocks for future civilisations to find – plastics in the ocean, evidence of fertiliser use, and (most of all) evidence of fossil fuel use.Frank says that civilisations might – through their collapse – trigger the conditions to create more fossil fuels, for future civilisations to use.Frank says, ‘Our work also opened up the speculative possibility that some planets might have fossil-fuel-driven cycles of civilization building and collapse. If a civilization uses fossil fuels, the climate change they trigger can lead to a large decrease in ocean oxygen levels.British man \u0027kicked Thai wife to death because she wouldn\u0027t have sex with him\u0027‘These low oxygen levels (called ocean anoxia) help trigger the conditions needed for making fossil fuels like oil and coal in the first place. In this way, a civilization and its demise might sow the seed for new civilizations in the future.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7724947.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"david lammy lashes government windrush deportations","story":"The government was accused of presiding over a ‘national day of shame’ as it emerged some British people may have been deported by mistake. MPs held an emergency debate on the Windrush Crisis today, which has seen people who came to the UK legally as children ‘losing their jobs, being denied NHS treatment’ and potentially even being sent back to the Caribbean.Amber Rudd apologised for the ‘appalling’ way in which some had been treated. She said she wasn’t aware of any specific cases where people had been deported but urged people to contact her if they knew of any.Immigrants from the Caribbean were invited to come to Britain with their families to help rebuild the country after WWII, but many don’t have documentation as bureaucracy was less rigid at the time.They are here totally legitimately, but have suffered consequences because they can’t prove it.If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas!This is a day of national shame: the PM and Home Sec must apologise! pic.twitter.comgxqoSErU3oTottenham MP David Lammy, whose own parents came from Guyana, was praised for a passionate speech in the Commons today.He said: ‘It is inhumane and cruel for so many of that Windrush Generation to have suffered so long in this condition, and for the Secretary of State to only make a statement today.‘Can she explain how many have been deported? It’s her department – she should know the number.‘Can she tell the house how many have been detained as prisoners in their own country?‘How many have been denied health under the NHS? How many have been denied their pensions? How many have lost their jobs?‘This is a day of national shame.’David Lammy said their treatment is ‘inhumane and cruel’ (Picture: BBC)He accused the government of pandering to far-right rhetoric on immigration leading to awful human consequences, saying: ‘When you lie down with dogs, you get fleas’.Ms Rudd told MPs she was ‘concerned’ that the Home Office had ‘become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’.‘This is about iniduals, and we have seen the inidual stories, and they have been, some of them, terrible to hear, and that is why I have acted.’She added: ‘I am not aware of any specific cases of a person being removed in these circumstances.‘That is why I have asked the high commissioners if they know of any, that they should bring it to me.‘And I would ask anybody here if they know of any such circumstances, they should bring them to the Home Office.’She earlier apologised for the way the Windrush generation had been treated, telling MPs during Home Office questions: ‘Frankly, some of the ways they have been treated has been wrong, has been appalling and I am sorry.’The  ‘Empire Windrush’ arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica with 482 Jamaicans on board, in 1948 (Picture: Getty)The Windrush Generation has been described as the people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971. It garnered its name from the ship MV Empire Windrush which was the first to carry workers over from Jamaica in 1948.People were moving over from the Caribbean after a call from the UK for more workers in industries such as agriculture and mining – in short, they were invited to help the country which was struggling after WWII.The Windrush Generation ends at 1971 as that is when the Immigration Act came in. The immigration before this was poorly documented and the Home Office did not keep accurate records or issue paperwork to those with the right to remain in the UK. This has not been a problem for years, but those without documents are now being told that they are necessary if they want to work, use public services or just live in the UK.We explain more here.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Government must ‘consider the question of compensation’ and said: ‘We have to acknowledge when the Commonwealth heads of governments are gathered in London, what a disgrace it is that this Government has treated Commonwealth migrants in this way.’Ms Rudd said there would be no removals or detentions: ‘In accordance with my wishes today, there will be no removals or detention as part of any assistance to help former Commonwealth citizens get their proper documentation in place.’MORE: Protester insists Bashar al-Assad is a good man because ‘he’s a doctor’MORE: Jeremy Corbyn claims Donald Trump ordered Theresa May to bomb Syria"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7730779.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"mel b frees nipple fun sun pals tough year","story":"Mel B’s bikini tried to do a runner (Picture: Backgrid)Mel B suffered a wardrobe malfunction on Saturday when her nipples decided they wanted to escape her bikini top.The Spice Girl looked like she was having the time of her life in the Californian sun and it seemed like her nips want to join in too as she splashed around in a swimming pool.Like many bikini-wearers, the 42-year-old’s nipples made a break as she emerged with a sexy pose from the waters in Desert Hot Springs.Mel B suffered a wardrobe malfunction (Picture: Backgrid)Away from the pool Mel joined her pal Gary Madatyan and paired her rebellious swimwear with a pair of glam stiletto heels and a cover up.The pair set up camp in the shade to relax and it seems our invitation was lost in the post.Wish you were here… (Picture: Backgrid)Her time in the sun comes after the talent judge host promised to ‘set the record straight’ with a new autobiography that will lift the lift on her ‘years of abuse’.Mel has been involved in a very public court case with her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte but has now revealed she is set to pen a book titled Brutally Honest after ‘keeping silent for a decade’.‘I have kept silent for a decade, but after a very public court case, I want to set the record straight.’ she said.‘This book will show that abuse can happen to anyone.

Every other word is yah #ThisMorning,’ another picked up.A third commented: ‘What happened to Hannah Spearritt’s voice? Why has she become posh all the sudden?! #thismorning’‘What’s happened to her accent?’ wondered another fan as a fifth quipped, ‘Does a fake posh accent come with every boob job now?’Recently the S Club 7 star revealed in an honest interview how a breast augmentation she’d had in 2013 left her suffering from hair loss and fatigue – she would spend 22 hours a day in bed – as well as painful muscles and with a fever, among many other symptoms.Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phil Schofield, Hannah revealed that in her struggle to find a diagnosis, she was told she was ‘crazy’ and put on medication rather instead of having further investigations into her illness.‘I’d have a panic attack at a pile of clothes that hadn’t been folded. I then got hair loss, fatigue, memory loss, brain fog. There was a list of symptoms that goes on and on.’Hannah and her boyfriend Adam appeared on ITV this morning (Picture: REX)Hannah said she and boyfriend Adam Thomas knew something was up and attempted to seek further medical advice, but hit a brick wall when she was told she was ‘crazy’.‘I went for every test out there, everything came back negative,’ she said. ‘I was told I was crazy and put on medication, and that got me through certain periods.’Hannah was on the S Club 7 reunion tour at this point and said the medication merely ‘masked’ what was truly going on.She went on to break up with boyfriend Adam as her illness came between them.‘I was more a carer than a partner,’ Adam said. ‘It was difficult because I had to separate the two. She was behaving in a way I didn’t recognise, and had to remind myself it was symptomatic. I had to remind myself it was her implants.’It turned out that although implants are under warranty, as Hannah couldn’t establish a link between the implants and her illness she wasn’t covered.Hannah was a part of pop group S Club 7(Picture: REX)But after Adam spoke with a doctor in America, who explained she might be suffering from Breast Implant Illness, they suddenly realised what might be wrong, and that there was a solution.‘That gave me the confidence to go with the explant,’ Hannah said, revealing she instantly started feeling better after having the fake books removed. ‘My energy came back in bucketloads, the low grade fever went, the anxiety went down, and then it was just a journey of detoxification and getting the immune system back up.’When asked by Phil how she feels about herself since she had the implants removed, she said: ‘I love them!

If his skin is exposed to the sun, it darkly tans and Oliver develops excessive freckling, which is a sign of UV damage and can develop into skin cancer.His mum Noelle Kei, 45, sews extra UV-safe fabric into his clothes and every few hours covers her son with both powerful cream-based and powder sunscreen.(Picture: SWNS)The windows of the family home and car are fitted with UV-protective film and even the lightbulbs in Oliver’s classroom have a sleeve to keep him safe from skin damage.Noelle said although his routine is ‘exhausting’ the family looks forward to the hours after sunset when Oliver can shed his restrictive gear and play outside with his four siblings.Those ‘sun-safe’ hours are what Oliver lives for. He explained: ‘I love when it’s nice and dark because I can finally take off my gear and it feels great.(Picture: SWNS)‘I love school breaks too because my family is on Oliver-time – we stay up really late and sleep-in so we can go outside and play in the backyard at night without my gear.‘My gear isn’t very annoying, it keeps me safe. Nobody at my school even asks me about it anymore because they all know about my XP.’Oliver’s mom, former flight attendant Noelle said: ‘Within ten minutes of the sun going down, he can shed his gear and be free from it.‘We love going to the playground after sunset, even when it’s cold in winter we bundle up.(Picture: SWNS)‘Sometimes we bring LED lanterns so we can play soccer and light up the field. It’s a bit sad that we have to do this, but it’s also joyful to watch him.‘Despite everything, he has a very good life, and he’s such a happy kid.‘When he was a baby I was always so careful with sunscreen and hats which is why I thought it was odd he was developing a lot of freckles at about 18 months.‘He developed a little mole on his cheek and my mom urged me to go and get it looked at by a dermatologist.(Picture: SWNS)‘When they told me it was XP I felt like I was hit by a train.‘The concept that he could be allergic to sun was bizarre to me. I had never even heard of something like that.’Noelle, who is married to Oliver’s dad, 42-year-old government official Albert Kei, added: ‘Adults can be so cruel.‘We’ve had people come up to Oliver and say things like “Is it Halloween already?” or call him a beekeeper or an astronaut.‘I’ve even made business cards that I can give people that explain Oliver’s condition that I give out when people ask questions or are whispering.’(Picture: SWNS)Oliver, who also lives with chronic conditions esophagitis and gastroparesis, is yet to develop skin cancer, but in a bid to lessen the risk, the family has considered moving to a colder climate – but can’t because Noelle has a condition called diffuse systemic scleroderma.She is due to start stem cell treatment for the autoimmune condition, which causes the thickening of the skin, next month.She added: ‘Oliver would still have to wear his protective gear but a reprieve from the California sun might make things easier.‘Unfortunately this is not something we can consider as a family right now.‘But Oliver is such a happy go lucky kid and he inspires me.

Konstantin, from Moscow, said: \u0027So our team has been in many different places - I\u0027d say we have come through both ice and fire, but this trip to Baikonur was the toughest in all the senses of this word.\u0027 Pictured: His team standing at the base of the rocket in Baikonur, with metal platforms rising to the top on either side           The ageing spacecraft are kept in the enormous Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is based in a Russian enclave deep within Kazakhstan\u0027s desert steppe. Baikonur was the world\u0027s first and largest space launch facility, with both Sputnik 1 (the first artificial Earth satellite) and Yuri Gagarin\u0027s Vostok 1 (responsible for the first manned spaceflight) launched from it. Now the facility is home to two shuttles that sit gathering dust after the termination of the Buran Space Program in 1993. Pictured: Two members of the team stand on one of the abandoned craft, which is literally gathering dust           Konstantin said: \u0027I hope our story will be interesting for everyone and I will be invited to work in Roskosmos - I like to photograph spaceships. Also I need to say that as a result of this trip we decided to build our own rocket - which is what we are actively dealing with now. It was a long way ahead - only a little bit shorter than to Paris. There were a lot of interesting things to see (with no tickets, special tours, approvals and so on) and of course adventures.\u0027 Pictured: A small doorway at the spaceport           His five-man team journeyed 15,500 miles in total from their Moscow starting point and had to turn off their headlights to avoid being seen by guards. Konstantin said: \u0027Baikonur is 2500km from Moscow. Going there by car is the cheapest and easiest way. The plan was as easy as the following: using offline maps - we wanted to get by car as close as possible in the desert then leave a car and walk through the sand towards the buildings of cosmodrome\u0027. Pictured: The spaceport, photographed from the long grass on its periphery           Describing his journey, the photographer said: \u0027We didn\u0027t want to be seen from the cosmodrome - that\u0027s why we drove with the lights off, sometimes using portable torches to light the way. But soon the car got stuck and we had to continue walking - we still had about two days before the launch. We were heading towards the biggest workshop on the territory of the cosmodrome.\u0027 Pictured: A rocket they found at the base           Konstantin said he used many of the old buildings to hide from detection. He explained: \u0027All those abandoned buildings were just a perfect place to hide. There were many places not to be noticed or found by the cosmodrome workers\u0027          Two large buildings at the base were photographed at night, with the starry Kazakh desert sky bright overhead. Konstantin described the secret mission as an adventure           During the final leg of the journey - a walk - it was hard to remain hidden, he said, explaining: \u0027It took us about 6 hours to walk 22km - and it was a point when we saw the buildings of the cosmodrome, then we had to move like partisans in order not to be seen and we still had to walk 4-6 km to get to the point.\u0027 Pictured: Their prize, an abandoned shuttle           The team of adventurers also climbed into the space shuttle and took photographs of the cockpit, which contained many of the original dials and toggles           The audacious snaps were taken by Konstantin Kosmodemiansky, a blogger and photographer from Moscow who trekked 17 miles through the desert with his friends in order to capture the bizarre scene          The ageing shuttles reside in a massive spaceport that sits alone, miles from any other settlements. Pictured: The lime-green interior of one of the craft          The cockpit still contains much of the original gadgetry needed to pilot the craft in space - but the windows need a thorough clean "},{"url":null,"title":"Royal Baby Psychic predicts Kate Middleton birth boy today","story":"True Thompson: Social media reacts to Khloe Kardashian\u0027s baby nameCoachella 2018: R.

But now he\u0027s been told to pipe down because he\u0027s too loudFollowing a single complaint, Wayne has been ordered to keep quiet. \u0027The council said they had a phone call from a woman saying we were making so much noise shouting. The official said it was under some sort of noise pollution regulation.\u0027Originally, they told him he couldn\u0027t shout until after lunch, but now the ban has been extended all day.Wayne, who pays £340 a month for his pitch, is understandably livid. \u0027The market has been there for hundreds of years and now someone moves into the High Street and decides they don\u0027t like the noise. It\u0027s part and parcel of street life. It\u0027s part of the atmosphere.\u0027If stall-holders cannot shout, then you lose part of that tradition. If I don\u0027t shout out I\u0027m going to be at least 30 to 40 per cent down on profit.\u0027Market traders are already struggling, like so many small shops today. Town centres are dying, not just because of online competition and out-of-town superstores, but as a result of extortionate rents, sky-high business rates and draconian parking regimes.Lymington is fortunate still to enjoy a vibrant market culture. So why the does the council seem hell-bent on destroying it?                             It\u0027s part and parcel of street life. It\u0027s part of the atmosphere. If stall-holders cannot shout, then you lose part of that tradition. If I don\u0027t shout out I\u0027m going to be at least 30 to 40 per cent down on profit.                         Greengrocer Wayne BellowsThe town\u0027s mayor, Barry Dunning, said he sympathises with Wayne and describes the market as Lymington\u0027s \u0027crown jewel\u0027. But, with the authentic voice of the Great British Jobsworth, he said the council had no option other than to intervene.\u0027Nuisance can be whatever you want to make it. We had a complaint and we had to follow it up.\u0027No, they didn\u0027t. They could have said to the woman who objected: \u0027Thank you, madam, but the market has been central to life in Lymington for the past 800 years and traders shouting is an integral part of that. We\u0027ve got better things to do than hang around the market with a decibel meter measuring the cries of fruit and veg sellers to see if they breach noise pollution regulations. Have a nice day.\u0027Not every complaint has to be taken seriously and acted upon accordingly. Just because someone objects to something, it doesn\u0027t mean it should be banned.This isn\u0027t the first time a market trader has fallen foul of an inidual with a grievance. Last October, I brought you the saga of Tina Gayle, a stall-holder on Loughborough market, in Leicestershire, who had her licence to trade withdrawn by the local council.Her \u0027crime\u0027 was to refuse to stop selling coffee mugs depicting the ancient order of the Knights Templar.

A council spokesman said: \u0027We want the public to have a safe and enjoyable experience when visiting our markets and we have a duty to ensure that items sold do not cause public offence. It\u0027s not for us to comment on why the mugs were offensive to the complainant.\u0027Yes, it is. Why should a single complaint — whether about \u0027offensive\u0027 coffee mugs or a stall-holder shouting too loudly — be sufficient to threaten someone else\u0027s right to earn a living, or end a centuries-old tradition?And while councils are only too willing to dance to the tune of aggrieved iniduals, they have no compunction in ignoring wider public opinion, especially when it comes to market traders. The reason that vendors such as Wayne Bellows now sell their fruit and veg in £1 \u0027bowls\u0027 — and not the pounds and ounces most of their customers would prefer — is because of the war on imperial measures pursued with Stalinist zeal by Town Halls all over Britain.Councils started persecuting market traders 20-odd years ago, forcing them to adopt metric weights and measures to \u0027bring us into line with Europe\u0027.Fishmongers, greengrocers and butchers were all charged with criminal offences because they wouldn\u0027t use kilograms.One fruit and veg merchant, Steve Thoburn, from Sunderland, was dragged through the courts for the heinous offence of using imperial scales.Public opinion was firmly on his side, but that didn\u0027t stop the authorities fighting him all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.Mr Thoburn died of a heart attack soon after losing his final appeal, aged just 39. He was hounded to death by officialdom.The Brexit vote was motivated not just by a desire to regain control of our own laws and borders. It was a rejection of the political class at every level, from Brussels right down to parish pump.That includes the jumped-up jobsworths who think they have the right to micro-manage our lives and stop market traders doing something they\u0027ve been doing for 800 years simply because of a single complaint from someone who finds it \u0027offensive\u0027.Wayne Bellows should tell them all to go to hell.

However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP’s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was “regrettable” to have a leadership transition without Sorrell’s involvement. “It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,” Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. “We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell’s departure on the group’s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.”It may not seem like it but Sir Martin Sorrell had a career before WPP. His affair with advertising began as Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi’s first finance directorSorrell made his first step toward global domination at the age of 40, investing in a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets called Wire \u0026amp Plastic ProductsSorrell announces himself on the global stage by buying J Walter Thompson, the world’s oldest ad agency and an iconic US brand for $566m. In 1988 he listed on NASDAQ exchange in New YorkWPP’s closest call with death came following an audacious debt-fuelled move to buy Ogilvy \u0026amp Mather for $864mSorrell paid too much for O\u0026ampM and as the recession-hit WPP almost went out of business, a profit warning in 1990 sent its shares tumbling from 650p in 1989 to 115p.

He stepped down on 14 AprilSorrell, 73, has “unreservedly denied” the misconduct allegations and WPP’s board has said it will not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm. The decision not to publish was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, who said there was a “real lack of transparency” and “any investigations done by the company should be made public”. The company said it had concluded the investigation and had no further comment to make. After years of above-par performances WPP put out two growth warnings last year – before reporting its worst financial year since the 2009 ad recession – as clients pulled budgets and investors started to question the future of the global holding company model in the increasingly digital age.“Whether WPP should survive in its current form is a more challenging question,” Davidson said. “Particularly as an increasingly complex and dynamic media landscape, and growing competition from more focused players will, in our view, require a degree of flexibility and agility that large holding companies could struggle to deliver.”A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and at WPP’s ad agency JWT Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network.The frontrunning internal candidates are Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP’s European operation, who were appointed WPP’s joint chief operating officers following Sorrell’s departure on Saturday.“We believe Sir Martin will be hard to replace with one person,” Paul Richards, analyst at Numis, said. “The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP. Our base case is for a new management team to continue and refine the existing strategy, though we acknowledge that any group without a chief executive is vulnerable to a bid approach in the interregnum.”Alex DeGroote, analyst at Cenkos Securities, puts the break-up value of WPP’s parts at about £17 a share, valuing the group at £22bn. WPP’s current share price is £11.50, a market capitalisation of £15bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ca1b3b73e16f2e6156c67352b1a99eea016cc9/0_219_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=940b13908e464f2d2a520337f6d8da91 1240w","title":"pound brexit high uk pay wages inflation unemployment rate business live","story":"Sterling rallies on speculation that wages may have finally overtaken inflation You can get up to speed on the UK labour market with these tweets from economist Rupert Seggins:Just over 15 minutes to go until the UK labour market report is released, and tension is growing in the City.Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING, says:The pound is continuing to strengthen, and just touched a new 22-month high of $1.4376 against the US dollar.Sterling had now risen for eight trading days in a row, as the City braces for UK interest rates to rise in May.

The match she lit over the gas stove caused an explosion, blowing out the concrete panels in her kitchen. It also caused an entire corner of Ronan Point, the high-rise in east London where she lived, to collapse.Hodge survived, but four people died and 17 were injured. The inquiry into the disaster found flaws in the construction of system-built housing. This led to changes in building regulations for tower blocks. The shocking visual impact of the scene – one corner of the block had collapsed like a house of cards – made clear what happens if buildings are not constructed to withstand disasters rather than just everyday stresses and strains.A report on the Grenfell Tower fire leaked to the London Evening Standard points out that the building – which was built after the Ronan Point explosion – was able to stay standing because of the width of the concrete on its lower floors, despite the ferocity of the blaze. And yet, had the tower been built to the lower end of modern building regulations, it is likely it would have collapsed, the report concluded.After Ronan Point, the public clamoured for safer homes, and measures were taken to prevent a repeat. But in the decades that followed, this belt-and-braces approach gave way to complacency, and an apparent pursuit of profit over safety. This complacency is obvious in the problems experienced by the tenants and homeowners in a new private property development in south-east London. New Capital Quay, a name as apt as if Mammon himself had decided to milk the property boom, currently has fire wardens patrolling the 11 blocks 247, after warnings from the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) about safety concerns, including Grenfell-style flammable cladding.Owners and tenants of the complex’s 900 flats have been raising concerns for months. One of the housing association renters, Simone Joseph, expressed concern back in February that the cladding remained, despite failing safety tests. Ruth Montlake, an 85-year-old tenant with hearing difficulties, worries that she won’t hear fire alarms and will struggle to escape from the seventh floor.Cecile Langevin, who lives in the development with her son and husband and who passed her pregnancy due date at the weekend, was stunned to find the value of her home has fallen from £475,000 to £50,000. After buying in good faith, the family, like many others on the development, face the prospect of either mountains of negative equity if they want the cladding gone and peace of mind in terms of physical safety, or accepting the financial reality and remaining in an unsafe home.The government argues that the freeholders of developments such as New Capital Quay, and similar ones in Croydon, Salford and around the country, have a “moral duty” to replace cladding and make it fire-safe without loading the cost on to residents. In reality, they have no such duty: the government’s “bonfire of red tape” has led to developers being able to build properties that present risks to safety, but passing inspections and conforming to regulations dating from the years before the Grenfell blaze.Disasters are rare, which is why the complacency of politicians and developers might have blossomed: fires are relatively common but usually contained. Disasters can also be averted, which is why the rigorous approach after Ronan Point was the correct response. After the 2009 blaze in Lakanal House, south London, which killed six people, fire regulations should have been bolstered, and institutions such as Southwark council, which breached regulations, should have faced harsher penalties.Instead, we were gifted David Cameron’s assault on regulation. Cameron boasted that the corner-cutting and revocation of many regulations on building and business would save £500 per home built: a small sum in the grand scheme of things. Weighing it against the value of a potential lost human life should be impossible.Ten months on from Grenfell, any form of clarity on the future, or even the present, would be welcome. Yet families who escaped are still living in hotels, and thousands find they are living in homes clad with the same kind of aluminium panels that covered Grenfell. It was government complacency and amenability to lobbying that created such a catastrophic mess, and yet there is scant sign of even a wish to provide redress for those stuck in these flats now, or of improved fire regulations for buildings in the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551ac1e2734257e1ac85a35532e7769f4b53dfc4/0_0_4481_2688/master/4481.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=776c12e1d7bc59ff4462fb9390f7f1a6 1240w","title":"zealots sleepwalk brexit theresa may","story":"Brexit fatigue is letting Theresa May off the hook, and obscuring the fact that a U-turn remains our best optionBrexit was predicted to be many things – triumphant, calamitous, impossible, a cinch – but never boring. Yet with less than a year to go, and vital questions still unanswered, Westminster’s interest has palpably waned. That partly reflects public disengagement. Europe is not raised much on the doorstep, say MPs, who are mostly grateful to talk about other things.There are pockets of Brexit passion. On Sunday hundreds of people went to the north London launch of the People’s Vote, a cross-party campaign demanding a referendum on the final deal. A smaller counter-demonstration asserted the view (prevalent outside the capital) that one referendum was enough. In news terms, that event was no competitor to airstrikes in Syria or wrangles with Russia over the Salisbury poisonings.Inevitably EU affairs drop out of the headlines from time to time. But there has been a general downgrade in Brexit urgency since provisional agreement was reached last month on a transition period. That means the article 50 deadline of next March applies only to the terms of withdrawal. The future trading relationship can be outlined in a “political declaration”, with 21 extra months to fill in the details.Hardline leavers don’t like this smudging of Brexit boundaries, but they haven’t kicked up a fuss because they recognise that transition is a lethal trap for the remain cause. It kills EU membership right on time next March, while deferring any painful impact until 2021, well beyond current political attention s.Pro-Europeans already find it hard to foment mass opposition to Brexit, not least because the leader of the\u0026nbspLabour party is happy leaving the EU. But the challenge of lobbying to preserve membership now is child’s play compared to how hard it would be petitioning for re-admission once the doors to the club have banged shut.Transition doesn’t diminish the need for a deal, but elongating the timetable has taken some of the clock-ticking drama out of the story, easing pressure on Theresa May. Yet none of the problems that seemed desperate in January have gone away. There is still no magical method for keeping an invisible border in Northern Ireland while leaving the customs union. There is still no rival to the Treasury’s cost-benefit analysis showing only a downside to exit from the single market. A substantial majority of MPs still believe that Brexit is an exercise in damage limitation. Yet few dare to follow that logic to the end: when an action can only be measured in damage, the best limitation strategy is not to do it at all.Deference to the referendum result is a powerful factor here, but not the only one. There is also our political and media culture that much prefers characters to processes. Brexit blips on to British radars not when important things happen in Brussels, but when Westminster politics turn colourful. A boisterous banality by Boris Johnson makes a splash. A technocratic torpedo in the form of a commission negotiating mandate, blasting holes in May’s Brexit ambitions, causes barely a ripple.It has never been easy to excite a British audience with the technicalities of the EU. It is hardest of all with those who voted leave hoping it meant they would never have to be bothered by such things again. And there is great, understated power in the politics of not being bothered. There were many remainers in 2016 who had no affection for the EU but didn’t think it was worth the hassle of leaving. As Brexit day gets nearer, the balance of being bothered shifts. It starts to look like a palaver to go back.Economists call this the sunk-cost fallacy – the tendency to factor in the psychological cost of time and money already spent when making a choice about the future. This is why people tend to buy random useless things, having driven a long way to get to the shops. To leave empty-handed feels like a waste of all that time on the road. But the lost time is irrecoverable – a sunk cost. It should have no rational bearing on current purchases.The months of fractious politics, social ision and economic uncertainty are the sunk costs of Brexit. They shouldn’t weigh against the potential benefits of retaining membership if, after gruelling negotiations, that looks like the best item on the menu. But a false intuition puts the weight there. British politics is deep in that fallacy. There is no enthusiasm in parliament for May’s Brexit, but nor is there a coherent lobby for a U-turn. Jeremy Corbyn is wedded to the idea of a better, socialist kind of Brexit. Most Tory MPs will vote for May’s bad deal if the alternative is a crisis that somehow propels Corbyn into No 10.The prime minister herself increasingly calls to mind\u0026nbspMacbeth, wearily committed to seeing a nasty business through to the end, “in blood stepp’d in so far, that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o’er”.Tedious, maybe. Not impossible. But it needs political courage and imagination. Those qualities are in short supply. There is instead growing complacency and fatalism around Brexit. The question of whether it should be done is treated as taboo by May and Corbyn. But the question of how it should be done hasn’t produced a credible answer to beat the option of not doing it at all. So we creep in this petty pace towards the final act, as if it were all predestined. It isn’t. If the UK does end up leaving the EU, the referendum result will be only half the reason. The other half will be a parliament that knew Britain was going the wrong way, yet couldn’t be bothered to lead the way back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc84cf2c4b4cd512659f4c4192bf9c9febf4ead5/0_0_4740_2844/master/4740.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70a29fa5216f511e991c3863e9c012af 1240w","title":"thousands of children miss out on preferred primary school england","story":"Pressure on places shows signs of easing in areas of England including London and BirminghamAfter an anxious wait documented by many parents on social media, more than half a million families across England were informed on Monday which school their child will be attending in September.Early analysis of local authority data suggests that, in many areas, higher proportions of children gained places at their first choice of school this year.

In other boroughs, however, demand remains high and success rates for securing places at preferred primaries are the lowest in the country.The school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: “We’re investing £5.8bn to create even more good schools and good school places – building on the 825,000 we’ve created since 2010 – resulting in nine out of 10 pupils securing one of their top three choices of schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2a2c7ad1b276242f7d5a6721b7a2bb116c8af6/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2128626c0be0fc4e94d2b833ef23c241 1240w","title":"oxford cambridge universities private raise fees","story":"Income loss from tuition fees cap could prompt a break from state control, which other institutions might followAs universities wait to see if the government will cut tuition fees – and therefore their income – one of the most controversial questions of all is being discussed. Could Oxford and Cambridge universities opt to break free from state control and go private?The government launched its review of post-18 education in February. With the Tories keen to woo young voters, following Jeremy Corbyn’s commitment to end tuition fees, a reduction of the £9,250 fees cap is widely expected. But vice-chancellors say quality could be threatened if the government does not plug any gap with new funding.Unlike other universities, Oxford and Cambridge say fees, even at £9,250, do not cover the costs of the tutorial-led teaching for which they are famous. A spokesperson for Cambridge would not comment about going private, but said each student costs an average of £18,500 a year to teach.It has been on the cards since the\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbsppromised a major review of funding across tertiary education in their election manifesto. With graduate debt running at £50,000 upwards, there has been growing concern about the cost of going to university and whether it represents value for money. Fees in the UK are among the highest in the world, and some doubt there will be a return on such a huge investment in terms of graduate earnings.The government is\u0026nbsppromising a wide-ranging review\u0026nbspof the whole of post-18 education and funding, including the ide between vocational and academic qualifications and the decline in lifelong and part-time study. Most of the interest will be in undergraduate tuition fees, which stand at a hefty £9,250 a year at all but a handful of universities.The government will not seek to match\u0026nbspLabour’s promise to axe tuition fees\u0026nbspaltogether, which the Conservatives regard as unaffordable and regressive. The review could recommend cutting or freezing fees. One of the most controversial options is the introduction of variable fees for different courses, depending on the cost of putting a course on, potential graduate earnings and the economic value to the country. So some universities might for example cut their fees for social science and humanities courses, which generally attract lower graduate earnings than engineering or maths.Not very. With the review set to run for a year, reporting in early 2019, the government has been accused of kicking the issue into the long grass. If you are applying to start university this September, nothing will have substantially changed.If they declared themselves independent, they could set their own fees and not have to endure state regulation, which requires them to prove the quality of their research – and what they do with it – plus that of their teaching and the amount their graduates earn.Matt Robb, of EY-Parthenon, a consultancy that advises universities, says: “Oxford and Cambridge are currently in the top five institutions in the world. If that status were threatened by loss of funding or other factors, and this was the only solution, I think they wouldn’t blink in pushing to go private.”Some experts argue that this could solve a conundrum for ministers, who want to cut fees but don’t want to damage two such stellar British brands.Butler adds that other elite universities might follow. A senior Oxbridge college figure agrees: “It would really only work if Oxford and Cambridge, Imperial College London, UCL, Kings College London and the LSE all went together.”Speculation about what the top two could charge students varies, but several insiders suggest around £15,000. They insist this would allow Oxbridge to follow Harvard University and offer “needs blind” admissions. One academic manager says: “Perhaps just one third of students might pay the actual sticker price.” But such high fees would still stir up huge controversy.Lord Butler says: “I think the government might be anxious that independent universities would become like private schools and would be largely confined to the well off. However, that needn’t be the case as universities with strong brands could ensure that access could be completely means tested, with bursaries for families who could not afford the fees.”However Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “If they walk away from the regulatory system they are basically the same as private schools. No one chases Eton hard about needs-blind admissions.” If admissions were scrupulously fair, the private universities would be less likely to spend as much time and money on going into state schools and searching for talented students.People often talk about admissions in America in a very positive light, but although there are needs-blind admissions, Ivy League universities also give places to the children of donors and alumni. Part of moulding a class is handpicking the wealthy.”Money is not the only driver behind the latest rumblings. There is also resentment about the government’s drive to treat students as consumers and to assess the value universities offer them.Stephen Toope, Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, blogged last month: “For a generation now, politicians of all stripes have talked as if UK universities are broken, and hence in need of ‘market discipline’. They talk as if our students, smart and energetic people, are in need of protection. This is an own goal.”Another vice-chancellor, who has asked not to be named, says: “We are seeing a real threat to institutional autonomy from ministers. I think right now we must be the closest we’ve ever been to a point where Oxford and Cambridge will turn round and say, ‘Sod this, we are fed up with being criticised, we’ll go private’.”But many in the sector think this is a leap too far. Prof Simon Marginson, director of the centre for global higher education at UCL’s Institute of Education, agrees that deregulation is one “obvious answer” for Oxford and Cambridge, but says that changing the relationship between universities and the state would be hugely problematic.“In political terms, giving these universities what they want is the opposite of what the government needs to do at the moment,” he says. “It needs to show it is supporting poor people, not elite universities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932e37f93c32f74c0fcb8d1134a99074a9642256/0_137_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=237a77a905f50210ec66eea648e7ec35 1240w","title":"year 6 sats tests stressful ministers reform","story":"Ministers should find an alternative to the year 6 exams, which put enormous pressure on teachers and pupilsThe past few years have seen a glut of parents proclaiming they are going to boycott year 6 Sats, the government’s national primary tests. Instead of sending their child in to school for exam week, they will “educate them elsewhere”, in a park or a museum, to get around the school absence rules. This year is no exception. If enough parents followed the trend, would it ever finish off Sats, which have become increasingly unpopular?In the US, parental protest contributed to several states abandoning the Obama administration’s plan for a national curriculum, known as the “common core”, against which all children would be tested. And states that continued still face protests. Just last year, in Long Island, New York, almost 80,000 children boycotted their maths exams.Here in England, our boycotting bark is worse than its bite. In 2016, more than 45,000 people signed a petition supporting parents keeping their children at home on Sats day. But when test day came, only a few schools reported big absences.Yet there are some compelling reasons to remove children from the exams. Teachers are under serious pressure to get great results. Performance-related pay means their salary can be pegged to children’s scores and, if overall results are low, the school can be labelled as failing or “coasting”, enabling the government to remove the school’s management (which it is not afraid to do).Add this pressure on to a fragile teacher – maybe he or she is new, maybe this year the class has a few more struggling kids – and suddenly the pressure becomes too much. Now, their stress transfers to the pupils, and it’s only a matter of time until your 11-year-old comes home crying because she overheard her teacher saying it’ll ruin his life if the class don’t get great scores.It was this sort of pressure that led Jill Wood, the headteacher of Little London primary school in Leeds, to go and physically get a child out of bed on test day and put him in an exam hall with a sick bucket on standby.Last year she was the first headteacher to have her entire school boycott Sats, after she swore never again to put her children through the pressure for something she felt was so meaningless.But rebellion never comes free. Parents about to mark their calendars to keep their children home need to know that the tests can be taken at any time up to a week after the original date. To keep your child from being scored in maths or English, this year you would need to keep them home for at least six days.Secondly, most secondary schools use Sats scores to set children by ability, particularly in maths. Having no score on their report card can mean they are simply lumped into a middle-ability set. Even if the school does its own tests, it can often take at least a term for inaccuracies to be corrected.Without Sats, it would be difficult for the government to track, for example, if poorer children were falling behind in some schools more than in others. The tests may not be super reliable, but no data will make inequalities even harder to tackle.One alternative would be a “sample” test, given to a group of selected children across the country, without relaying the inidual data back to schools, thus diminishing the stress on teachers and reducing the relentless drilling most 11-year-olds endure in the months leading up to the tests .The government should consider this option, but so far it seems dead set against doing so.If you are planning to keep your child at home for six days next month, perhaps one of their educational activities could be writing to the minister to advocate for some better ideas."},{"url":null,"title":"the way some pigs are reared is upsetting and wrong say shoppers","story":"Most people willing to swap to supermarkets trying to improve farming standards, survey findsShoppers around the world overwhelmingly support high animal welfare standards for pigs, and most would also be prepared to change their supermarket habits in response, an international survey on pork consumption has found.Seven out of 10 people questioned said they found the manner in which pigs are reared for slaughter on some factory farms “upsetting”, “wrong” or “shocking”, after being shown photographs of some pig-keeping conditions in the online poll. The survey highlighted practices such as sows kept in small cages, antibiotic use, as well as tail-docking, teeth-grinding and castration, sometimes without pain relief.Eight out of 10 shoppers surveyed in more than ten countries agreed that high welfare for pigs was important, and nearly nine of out of 10 in three key countries said they could be persuaded to shop at a supermarket committed to improving the lives of pigs. However, fewer than one in three shoppers in most countries polled said they actively looked for labels on pork products indicating the animals had been reared in high-welfare conditions, and the great majority of those surveyed globally cited price, quality and appearance as more important in choosing which pork products to eat.The survey was carried out on behalf of World Animal Protection, and involved interviews with nearly 10,000 consumers worldwide, including the UK, the US and China, all major consumers of pork products, by the polling company Voodoo. About 1,000 interviews were conducted in each country in the report.World Animal Protection, a campaigning organisation, called on major supermarkets to pledge higher pig welfare in sourcing their meat, and urged consumers to demand change from retailers. Steve McIvor, chief executive, said: “Supermarkets hold the power to create better lives for pigs. We are encouraging customers of leading supermarkets to let them know they expect higher welfare standards for pork products, with the guarantee that pigs are raised right.”The group wants pigs to be allowed to live in social groups in comfortable environments, with opportunities to express natural behaviour, and an end to practices such as those highlighted in the survey: sows in small cages, pigs kept in “dark, squalid warehouses and cramped, stressful conditions”, piglets having their teeth ground and tail docked without anaesthetic, and the overuse of antibiotics.Consumer concerns over poor conditions for many pigs was outlined in the UK recently in the BBC programme Countryfile, in which a farmer showed pigs being reared in cages, provoking furious responses on social media both from those shocked by what they saw and defenders of intensive farming for enabling cheaper meat.Changing buying habits among consumers may be a challenge, as most surveyed do not currently base their consumption on welfare considerations and many showed little awareness of key aspects of pig-rearing.Minimum standards such as the space in which sows are kept and basic restrictions on antibiotics are enforced in countries such as Europe but are not enough, according to campaigners, while the rearing of pigs in “mega-farms” in which they rarely have access to the outdoors is on the increase.We want to hear from people working in the farming and food production industry around the world as we begin a new investigative series.Share your views and experiences using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Some supermarkets around the world have already committed to higher welfare standards. From July, for instance, the Co-op in the UK will source all of its own-brand fresh pork, bacon, sausage, gammon and ham from outdoor-bred pigs on RSPCA-assured farms.Jo Whitfield, the retail chief executive of Co-op, said: “The highest animal welfare standards should not just be the preserve of top-tier products and we want to ensure that the very best-quality British pork is available at everyday affordable prices.”On outdoor-bred farms, piglets and their mothers have access to the outdoors for about four to six weeks from birth. After that, they can be reared indoors. In outdoor-reared systems, the pigs have access to fields for about half their lives.Contact us with your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26eae40db36550827e458650b225737d8a5b9a42/0_48_1367_820/master/1367.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fbf7502270e2f8383ce4312de427de56 1240w","title":"jose mourinho manchester united paul pogba bournemouth fa cup semi final","story":"• ‘What is the criteria to choose a team? The way they play’• Manager explains substitution of Paul Pogba against West BromJosé Mourinho has appeared to question the ambition of some Manchester United players after the defeat by West Bromwich Albion that left Manchester City Premier League champions.The team who lost 1-0 at Old Trafford were all internationals and the manager offered an enlightening response on Monday when asked whether he was getting enough from experienced players. “Consistency has nothing to do with age,” he said. “It has to do with personality, has to do with the way you live for football, what is your priority in your life, what are your ambitions. This has nothing to do with age.“I have met players of 30 years old who were not consistent at all and I found boys of 18, 19, 20 who were real men, real pros.

You can do it if your team is not losing the ball, but our team was losing the ball so everything was complicated. We were losing lots of balls, so by losing lots of balls, with turns and flicks and tricks, the midfield players and central defenders are at risk of one touch, one late challenge and they are out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d11c9c2495119c189934dc223800dcabe6e7fa0/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5c29bf0878ad5506a356f41855c041d8 1240w","title":"west ham united stoke city premier league match report","story":"These are the moments when Gareth Southgate could be forgiven for wondering whether it is time to draw a line through Joe Hart’s international career. This was another personal ordeal for the man who has just lost his place as England’s first-choice goalkeeper. Southgate was here to witness it and, at this rate, there has to be a serious possibility that Hart will be cut adrift from the England squad that goes to Russia for this summer’s World Cup.What other conclusion can be drawn when the goalkeeping error that led to Peter Crouch, one of Stoke’s substitutes, opening the scoring can hardly be described as a one-off? Indeed, Hart did something very similar in the 3-0 defeat at home to Burnley last month, on the day he was recalled to the side after a long spell in the wilderness. It is becoming a recurring theme and West Ham’s fans were not in the mood to be sympathetic after his latest lapse. There were ironic, unforgiving cheers towards the end whenever Hart gathered the ball without making a mistake.At least Hart was spared the ignominy of his mistake being the game’s decisive moment and West Ham’s equaliser, courtesy of the fit-again Andy Carroll, helped David Moyes’s team edge another point further away from the relegation places. Stoke, on the other hand, remain in 19th position, having passed up a glorious opportunity to register their first away win since October. Paul Lambert’s side now have only four games to save themselves and still have to play Liverpool after they have hosted Europa League-chasing Burnley on Sunday.Lambert looked crestfallen afterwards but Stoke’s manager was stretching the truth when he said all the luck had gone against his team. On the contrary, there were three disallowed goals for West Ham in a chaotic second half for the referee, Michael Oliver, in his first game back since the now-infamous Champions League tie between Juventus and Real Madrid, Gianluigi Buffon’s red card and all the unpleasantness that has followed.Marko Arnautovic had strayed offside before directing in his 55th-minute header and the same player was flagged again when Edimilson Fernandes fired in a shot from 20 yards. This time, Arnautovic was standing directly in Jack Butland’s line of vision and, though Moyes seemed aggrieved at the time, he accepted afterwards it was a fine piece of officiating. West Ham’s manager was less impressed with the decision, in stoppage-time, to penalise Carroll for his challenge on Ryan Shawcross just before another substitute, Javier Hernández, fired in what would almost certainly have been a winner.It was a dramatic finale to a game that had taken a long time to ignite and, for Carroll, a personal triumph given that he had not played since 4 January and, at one point, was not expected to feature again this season. His goal was expertly taken: he guided in a controlled left-foot volley from Aaron Cresswell’s cross and shifted the mood just as the West Ham fans were preparing, undoubtedly, for another show of loud dissent at the final whistle. Carroll returned to full training only five days before this match and there was an irony that it was two of England’s forgotten men who came up with the goals on the night Southgate was in the crowd to keep tabs on the two goalkeepers.Moyes made a point afterwards of not being too hard on Hart, restricting himself to saying it was a “surprise” to see the former England No 1 fumbling Xherdan Shaqiri’s shot into Crouch’s path. Moyes also made the point, legitimately, that Hart had made some fine saves in their previous game at Chelsea. Yet this felt like a manager trying not to damage Hart’s confidence any further. The truth, however it is dressed up, was that it was a wretched error from an increasingly accident-prone goalkeeper.For Stoke, the disappointment was their inability to hold on once they had put themselves in a winning position. The game lived down to expectations during the opening 45 minutes – two ordinary sides huffing and puffing without any real wit or creativity – and it was easy to see why Stoke were averaging under a goal per game this season. Stoke have not managed two goals in a league fixture since January. They have the worst goal difference in the league and it is a problem that needs to be fixed if there is to be a dramatic feat of escapology in the next few weeks.Lambert argued afterwards that if Stoke had played this well throughout the season Mark Hughes would still be their manager and the team would not be in the bottom three. There was a fair amount of top-spin on that assessment but in one respect it was an improvement – Stoke had lost their previous seven fixtures in London, conceding 26 goals in the process. Ultimately, though, it needed a goalkeeping mistake for them to take the lead and that, for Hart, made this a night that could have serious ramifications for his hopes of going to the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b087aaf918b4410734bcb6c546b514e88c18fec/227_402_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cc9b73286296cfbe783fc02b099445dd 1240w","title":"iraqi women targeted amnesty report","story":"Amnesty reports that women suspected of Isis links face sexual violence in IDP camps, amid claims they are being denied aidIraqi women suspected of family links to Islamic State extremists are facing a campaign of sexual violence and exploitation in displacement camps inside the country, according to a hard-hitting report from Amnesty International.The accounts of violence, including rape, come amid claims that authorities are also denying aid to the women, as well as refusing them the opportunity to return to their homes.Researchers who visited eight camps for internally displaced Iraqis found that sexual exploitation was occurring in all eight. Based on interviews with 92 women, the Amnesty report highlights the plight of thousands of female-headed families left to fend for themselves after their male relatives men were killed, arrested or forcibly disappeared while fleeing areas around Mosul. In many cases, the men’s only “crime” detailed in the report was escaping an Isis stronghold, or having a similar name to those on questionable “wanted lists”, or working in non-combat roles, such as cooks or drivers. The most serious allegations contained in the report relate to rape. Four women told researchers they had either witnessed rape or heard the screams of a woman in a nearby tent who was being raped by armed men, members of the camp administration, or other camp residents – with claims that women were being coerced into sexual relationships in exchange for desperately needed cash, humanitarian aid and protection from other men. One 20-year-old woman, Dana, said she had survived several rape attempts and was facing relentless pressure to have sex with a member of the security forces in her camp. “Because they consider me the same as an Isis fighter, they will rape me and return me,” she said.“They want to show everyone what they can do to me – to take away my honour. I can’t feel comfortable in my tent. I just want a door to lock and walls around me. Each night, I say to myself, ‘Tonight is the night I’m going to die.’” Many of the women interviewed by Amnesty in IDP camps expressed fears for their safety.Lynn Maalouf, the organisation’s Middle East research director, said: “Women are being subjected to dehumanising and discriminatory treatment by armed men operating in the camps for their alleged affiliation with Isis. “The very people who are supposed to be protecting them are turning into predators.“The Iraqi government must show it is serious about ending the violations against these women by holding all perpetrators to account and stopping all armed men from entering the camps.” The threat of sexual violence comes on top of evidence of other forms of abuse and discrimination aimed at the women, including the refusal of tribal elders to allow them to return to their home towns and villages. Those who do manage to return have experienced eviction, forced displacement, looting, threats and abuse, including sexual abuse and harassment, in some instances, seeing their houses defaced with the word “Daeshi” (or Isis) and having their electricity, water and other services cut off. “Sometimes I ask myself: why didn’t I just die in an airstrike?” said Maha, another woman interviewed for the report. “I attempted to commit suicide but I didn’t follow through. I put kerosene on myself, but before I set it on fire, I thought of my son. “I feel I am at my end. I am in a prison here. I am completely alone – without my husband, my father – no one is with me any more.”The situation for women is likely to get even worse as international funding for the humanitarian crisis in Iraq is projected to decrease sharply. Before Iraq’s parliamentary elections in May, displaced people are being urged to leave IDP camps as the government’s focus turns to closing and consolidating them.Maalouf added: “The authorities must also immediately end the systematic and widespread practice of forcibly disappearing men and boys with perceived ties to Isis, which has has left thousands of wives, mothers, daughters and sons in desperate situations.“To put an end to the poisonous cycle of marginalisation and communal violence that has plagued Iraq for decades, the Iraqi government and international community must commit to upholding the rights of all Iraqis without discrimination. Without this, there can be no national reconciliation or lasting peace.”Names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc75691c727379d71e3a38380ed552b3bbd3ada9/0_0_1280_854/master/1280.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9912f7a42554f10c293c3d3bc31dc1 1010w","title":"why janelle monaes vagina pants make me cheer","story":"The pop star’s video for Pynk gives us Vagina Monologues for a new generation. It’s joyous, uplifting – and about as subtle as a sledgehammerVaginas don’t get the best press. They are either being grabbed by future US presidents, trolled on social media, en route to a labiaplasty, mistrusted for their monthly capacity to shed blood or weaponised in the endless debates over gender-neutral toilets. So when Janelle Monáe, a black, queer, working-class star, shows up in her latest music video sporting a giant pair of juicy vagina pants, it’s joyous and uplifting.The video of Pynk, Monáe’s new single, directed by Emma Westernberg and featuring the equally bonkers Grimes, is a queer, arch and deliciously sexy ode to the vagina. Those pants are essentially chaps reconfigured as hot-pink labia – and it doesn’t get gayer than that. In the video, Monáe and her gang of women romp around the desert, drive pink convertibles and wear knickers bearing slogans such as “I grab back” on them. We really need to come up with a female equivalent of “phallic” to do all this justice. Vulvic?So this is what pussy power reclaimed by black women in the 21st century looks like: fun and inclusive. The whole thing is, happily, about as subtle as a sledgehammer at one point Monáe’s rumoured girlfriend, the actor Tessa Thompson, pops her head out from between her billowing vagina legs with a saucy grin. And there are lots of, erm, vulvic shots of dripping ice lollies and manicured fingers pushing through doughnut holes. But the point is serious. Not all the women are wearing vagina pants because, well, not all women have vaginas. Or as Monáe put it on Twitter, “No matter if you have a vagina or not.” Thompson’s response to being thanked for “giving black girls their own Vagina Monologues” was: “to all the black girls that need a monologue that don’t have Vaginas, I’m listening”. Here’s the thing: vaginas can be enjoyed and celebrated by anyone, but everyone should respect them.It wasn’t that long ago – when I was growing up, in fact – that Whitney Houston’s skin was allegedly being lightened by her label in publicity shots and black artists were routinely expected to “cross over”. To be more white, in other words, if they wanted success. Monáe’s video, which has caused quite a ruckus online, is an unashamed celebration of black female sexuality.

Jalebi were my favourite as a child – golden, almost iridescent swirls of crisp batter soaked in a spiced sugar syrup. Traditionally, the batter is left overnight to ferment, giving it a sour tang. I’ve taken a shortcut and used yoghurt, but if you have any spare sourdough starter, it would make a perfect base for jalebi batter. Just add extra flour or water until you have the correct consistency.Apple juice is not part of the traditional recipe, but its sharpness works well with all the sugar.

Continue to boil until the volume has reduced by half, then turn off the heat and add the cardamom, saffron and rosewater. Set aside to cool.Make the batter by stirring together all the dry ingredients and then the yoghurt to make a thick paste. Gradually add water a little at a time, until you have a thick but pipeable consistency.Heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat (about 160C325F if you use a kitchen thermometer). When the oil is the correct temperature, a drop of batter should float to the surface and start bubbling almost immediately.Transfer the batter into a piping bag, snip off the end and quickly pipe swirls of it into the oil. Depending on the size of your pan, you will be able to fit two or three swirls per batch.

Clearly no one expected an august institution like the Pulitzer to start handing out gongs to the Backstreet Boys or Mötley Crüe, but the notion that not a single work by any American pop artist over the last seven decades has been thought worthy is mind-boggling. They gave an “additional citation” to Bob Dylan in 2008, and to Hank Williams in 2010 – a mere 57 years after the latter’s death – but the prize itself has remained almost exclusively the domain of classical music. In its history, there have only been three jazz winners: Wynton Marsalis in 1997, Ornette Coleman in 2006, and Henry Threadgill in 2016.Then again, the Pulitzer has a longstanding reputation for being quite extraordinarily stuffy. The most celebrated example of its snobbery may have come in 1965, when the jury decided that no current music was worthy of an award, and attempted instead to give a special citation to Duke Ellington, in recognition of the groundbreaking body of work he had amassed over the preceding 50 years. Not, one would have imagined, a particularly controversial decision: by 1965, Ellington was rightly regarded as a straight-up, no-further-questions genius who had elevated jazz to an orchestral art form worthy of comparison with more “respectable” musical genres decades before. But the Pulitzer board refused to give out the award. Indeed, it wasn’t until 1996 that an African American, George Walker, won the prize itself. In 2004, then Pulitzer administrator Sig Gissler said they would be “broadening the prize a bit” so it could be awarded to music not from the European classical tradition it no longer became obligatory for entrants to submit a score. Even so, there was no mention of pop music in their idea of what constituted “distinguished American musical compositions”. The official announcement of the new policy involved everything but: “The contemporary classical symphony to jazz, opera, choral, musical theatre, movie scores and other forms of musical excellence.”This clearly makes Kendrick Lamar’s achievement all the more striking in its break with the prize’s dusty traditions. This year’s award hasn’t gone to some rarefied piece of electronica with classical pretensions, but to a double platinum-selling hip-hop album by an artist who packs out arena venues. Still, if you were going to pick a contemporary pop artist to storm the Pulitzer’s barricades, Lamar is an obvious choice.They’ve chosen someone both at the top of his game and at the forefront of a post-Ferguson renaissance in righteously angry, politically engaged black music that genuinely bears comparison to soul music’s revered early 1970s golden era. Furthermore, he’s proved that it is possible to make a huge mainstream impact with music that never panders to the lowest common denominator and never underestimates its audience’s intelligence. It is frequently complex, knotty, contradictory, claustrophobic and disjointed it regularly nods towards black music’s history – referencing everything from the lusciously soft soul of the Chi-Lites to Outkast’s psychedelic take on rap – but never feels comfortingly familiar. Perhaps the commercial success of such ostensibly uncommercial material is down to the fact Lamar makes music that perfectly reflects its era. He may have claimed that Damn represented a step back from the sociopolitical fury of its predecessor To Pimp a Butterfly, an album that ended up being lauded by the outgoing president of the United States – it even contained a backwards message complaining of “the pain in my heart carrying the burden for the struggle” – but Damn never shies away from addressing serious issues: black empowerment, protest, the Trump presidency, violence, inflammatory right-wing punditry. Anxious, scattered and disquieting, the musical backing sounds like living through 2017 frequently felt. You could argue long into the night about whether or not the approval of an institution like the Pulitzer prize is antithetical to the messages contained in Damn, but an award that’s frequently courted accusations of rarefied, snooty irrelevance could hardly have picked a more relevant and impactful album to give its approval to.• This article was amended on Tuesday 17 April, to add Wynton Marsalis and Henry Threadgill to the list of jazz winners of the Pulitzer prize for music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea1f93858b2a86bfbe847e1c24c60a3bdb6743a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5697bdbf0a52964c389819d3b58d7ac0 1240w","title":"brexit legislation caught in parliamentary logjam","story":"Almost half the bills needed to pave way for leaving EU have yet to be introduced to parliamentA parliamentary logjam will mean the government is likely to struggle to pass vital legislation paving the way for leaving the EU before the parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal.Almost half of all the legislation that is needed has yet to be even introduced by ministers.MPs returned to parliament on Monday after the Easter recess – the 123rd day that parliament has sat since the general election – but the government is still to pass a single piece of Brexit legislation. Parliament will only sit for another 80 days before MPs are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal struck between Theresa May and the European Union, scheduled for October.The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said there was now “a real danger” that MPs would be ask to vote on the final Brexit deal without having approved crucial legislation, such as the immigration bill, and would be voting blind.The prime minister has promised the UK parliament will be the first to ratify the deal, before it goes to the EU parliament and the other 27 states, though the timeline may slip.Last June, May said this parliament would be a “busy legislative session.” In total, the government has only passed four bills from last year’s Queen’s speech. By comparison, the 2010 coalition government had passed twice as many laws at this stage of the parliament. The general election delivered a hung parliament, leaving May able to pass bills only with the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party and dependent on the discipline of Conservative MPs. In December, pro-EU Tory MPs defeated the government to guarantee parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. The Lords is currently debating the bill and may yet inflict another defeat on the government by passing an amendment to keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU. The amendment, sponsored by former Conservative party chair Lord Patten, calls for the government to negotiate an arrangement “which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the EU”.Several other key pieces of legislation have been delayed, in part because of concerns about the possibility of Conservative rebellions.Chapman said MPs may be expected to vote on the final Brexit deal before they have even had the chance to scrutinise important details such as the government’s immigration plan. “Take back control didn’t mean running away from parliament,” she said. “It’s frankly embarrassing that, more than 10 months since the general election, the government hasn’t passed a single piece of Brexit legislation. Ministers have delayed crucial votes and failed to introduce vital bills.”MPs have not voted on Brexit in more than two months, while crucial votes on the customs bill and trade bill have been delayed for more than two months – and are now not expected until after the local elections next month.Conservative MPs in favour of a soft Brexit, including two of the party’s select committee chairmen and three former ministers, have put their name to amendments that would force the prime minister to put Britain’s membership of a customs union back on the negotiating table. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour’s policy is to support such an arrangement, raising concerns in No 10 that May could be defeated on a key plank of her Brexit strategy. However, it remains unclear whether the Tory MPs behind the amendment would go as far as pushing for a vote if there was a real possibility of fatally undermining the prime minister. A government spokesperson said: “Brexit is an issue of national importance and clearly it is important that parliament is given the proper opportunity to scrutinise the legislation that will underpin it. “We are making good progress and we are confident that we can pass the necessary legislation in good time. For example, the EU (withdrawal) bill has already moved through the Commons and is now at report stage in the Lords while the nuclear safeguards bill and sanctions and anti-money laundering bill have made good progress through both Houses.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae682279b59792add2e5ea91fad9300712af79e/94_52_3362_2018/master/3362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6d3b87ee9722ebfe2d2f295dc2fff657 1240w","title":"brexit weekly briefing launch of the campaign for a peoples vote","story":"Cross-party grouping is seeking what it carefully avoids calling a second referendumWelcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing.

We do it because we believe our perspective matters and it may be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian Supporter. Thank you.With Westminster and Brussels on holiday, there weren’t many. But as the UK and EU gear up for their first discussion this week on the future relationship, MPs from the four main parties in Britain launched a push for a “people’s vote” on the final deal. Carefully avoiding the term “second referendum”, the cross-party lineup included the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran and Chuka Umunna, who urged his Labour party to be “true to its values and support this”. Whether the proposition can win a majority in the House of Commons is unclear. But pressure on the government to secure a sensible final deal mounted, with the Institute of Directors bluntly urging it to maintain close ties with the EU after Brexit.The IoD said trade with the EU and the rest of the world would have to be boosted to fulfil ministers’ “global Britain” ambitions, with the EU currently providing stronger growth for UK firms selling overseas than Asia or North America.  A warning of what might be in store if the government gets it wrong came from Jaguar Land Rover, which announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs owing to Brexit “headwinds” – while Ireland reiterated its regular reminder of trouble ahead. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned that the withdrawal treaty and the transition agreement would both be at risk as early as June unless Britain came up with an acceptable wording as a “backstop” solution to the Irish border question in the event of no deal.In the Guardian, Hugo Dixon argues that Brexit is looking bad on all fronts, which is why there should be a people’s vote on the final deal:Quitting the EU will affect us for generations to come. It will impact jobs, the NHS, the environment, our ability to stand up to bullies across the world, our pride and even the unity of the United Kingdom. A good deal would be good for our public services, prosperity, power and peace. But as new facts emerge, it is clear Brexit will fail on all counts. The leave campaign’s slogan was “take back control”. This is a bad joke. As Theresa May makes one climbdown after another in the Brexit talks, it’s clear we are losing control. This is because we need the EU more than it needs us – exactly the opposite of what Johnson, Gove and co promised two years ago. This tail-between-our-legs Brexit will be bad for our pride and bad for our power. We’ll have less clout on the global stage too. At a time when Russia is flexing its muscles, is it really sensible to burn our bridges with Europe? Brexiters will, no doubt, seek to trash the idea of a people’s vote by calling it a second referendum. It’s not. In 2016, voters had a choice between the reality of staying in the EU and the fantasy promised by the leave campaign. Once we know what the deal is, we will be able to compare two realities. That’s not undemocratic. It’s common sense.In the New Statesman, George Eaton argues that public opinion remains too ambiguous for most MPs to back a new vote: The Home Office “hostile environment” inflicted on Windrush-era citizens from the Caribbean could bode ill for EU nationals in the UK:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80eae0b0c1fcd8eeacd81704b3aa246a41dfddeb/141_0_4008_2406/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d66041023dbcb7cc546893f125a362ea 1240w","title":"lords tell political pollsters to get house in order","story":"Committee warns industry over ‘widespread loss of confidence’ in polling since 2015The House of Lords has called for the polling industry to “get its house in order” following three straight years of political polls “calling it wrong” over two general elections and the EU referendum.In its report, the House of Lords committee on political polling and digital media also noted that the use of social media to adversely influence the political debate was “deeply concerning”.There has been a “widespread loss of confidence in polling” since 2015, when the pollsters failed to predict a Conservative win, the report says. There are also “concerns about the extent to which inaccurate polls might be shaping the ‘narrative’ during election campaigns, and therefore how they might be affecting the democratic process”.As a result, the Lords recommend expanding the role of the British Polling Council, the self-regulatory body of the public polling industry, to go beyond simply ensuring transparency in how pollsters operate. In the future, the report says, the BPC should “work with the Electoral Commission, the Market Research Society and media regulators such as Ipso and Impress to ensure that the best methodologies are used, that sources of poll funding are declared, that polls are better reported and that polling performance is openly reviewed after each general election”.Lord Lipsey, the chairman of the committee, said: “The polling industry needs to get its house in order. Otherwise the case for banning polling in the run-up to elections – one we for now reject – will become stronger. “We heard compelling evidence that polls influence the narrative around elections and thus go to the root of our democratic debate. This makes it vital they are conducted properly and held to the highest standards of accuracy.”The committee also examined the role of social media during elections. It backed calls to require disclosure on online campaign material, requiring an imprint – similar to printed pamphlets – stating who has published it. “This will be crucial in helping to ensure that public confidence is maintained in the electoral system,” the report says. It notes, however, “that this will do little to address the challenges posed by international actors who try to operate below the radar”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc02900b1907fcbf61529ccd20eb0562d42af86/1050_116_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c6bd69b46164f4ed104bd27e5d5228e5 1240w","title":"ben stokes ipl t20 england cricket joe root captain","story":"It’s 6pm at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. A drowsy sun has already slunk below the stands, kites glide overhead and after three hours of intense training in the heat, where he has batted twice, thundered in with the ball for the first time in weeks and stayed late to work on his flying boundary catches, Ben Stokes strolls over for a chat.There is of course one almighty elephant in the ground. We both briefly acknowledge this but it remains just that. This is his first in-depth interview since the incident in Bristol on 25\u0026nbspSeptember last year but regarding events that night Stokes must wait to have his say in court this summer after he and two other men pleaded not guilty to affray. For now it is only cricket, both England and Indian Premier League, that can be on the agenda in the Garden City.The Indian Premier League first, where the 26-year-old is in his second season and at his second side, Rajasthan Royals. Eoin Morgan, one of his two international captains, has recently credited the all-rounder’s MVP-winning stint with the runners-up Rising Pune Supergiant last year for “breaking down barriers” and causing the English invasion that has a record 12\u0026nbspplayers spread across six of the eight franchises.Stokes appreciates their presence in Twenty20’s great tamasha, rather than with their counties, is not to everyone’s taste back home. The subject of his £1.7m deal with Pune last year – a record for an overseas player – and new price tag at just a shade under, is one at which he squirms. “Last year there was so much said about me and the money. I just shy away from it. I don’t want to come across as arrogant. I don’t know how to answer it. It’s just weird,” he says.Stokes is clearly enjoying his time with the Royals. The inaugural IPL winners in 2008, they are now trying to rebuild public trust in their first season back as the result of a two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal that cost three players their careers. He has struck up a particular rapport with Shane Warne, the team’s mentor, while Jos Buttler is a familiar face in the ranks. But as is the case with England, all team‑mates tend to gravitate towards him.His only off-field struggle in India has come from some of the commercial demands that pack out the schedule on non-match days. “They ask you to do things that are so far out of your comfort zone – it’s just not me,” he says, perhaps in reference to some lively Bollywood-style dancing of his that can be witnessed during the IPL’s numerous TV ad breaks.The feet are moving better on the field even if the returns do not yet jump off the page. His third match against Royal Challengers Bangalore – a high-scoring 19-run win on the day after the interview – is the most impactful yet, with a 21-ball 27 from No\u0026nbsp4, his first wicket of the campaign and a leaping boundary catch to remove Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the RCB struggle in their pursuit of 218.While the latter was a classic case of Stokes making the ridiculous look sublimely simple – his extra training 24 hours earlier leapt to mind as he sprung high – it is likely the bowling will have given Stokes most satisfaction, purely for the fact he was charging in at full tilt for the first time in a long time.A pre-Christmas spell in New Zealand with Canterbury notwithstanding, the general lack of action leading into his return for England in February had affected his body. Bowling in the one-day series saw wickets follow but he found his legs seized up after spells. Then, just before the Tests that followed, some historical stress fractures in his lower back suddenly began to cause him grief and injections were required.Just 10 laboured overs were sent down in the two Tests that followed the jabs but Stokes says he is feeling himself again to prevent a recurrence he is remodelling his bowling action. The late step into the crease that pointed him to fine leg and left him needing to twist in order to straighten up is being eased out. He is happy with the results but the true test is in the middle.The return to the England camp – he has been restored to the side until the end of proceedings – was probably as smooth as he and his employers could have hoped. Stokes says the squad’s response felt no different to before from his perspective – “it’s not like we hadn’t stayed in touch” – but admits watching his Test colleagues among them go down 4-0 in Australia was tough. “I lived every moment of the Ashes. I’m sure it was nowhere near the emotions of the guys out there but I was just as gutted.”Readjustment batting-wise took little time either, with one low-key score of 12 in the first one-dayer at Hamilton – “I was anxious. I was guilty of thinking too far ahead and trying to make an impression. It was like I was at the start of my career,” – before a less flustered unbeaten 63 steered Morgan’s side to a series‑levelling win at Mount\u0026nbspMaunganui.“I was really emotional after getting man of the match in that second game back. It was such a relief to perform and be there at the end. I had five minutes to myself after getting back to the dressing room, sat in my bubble and taking it all in. The lads appreciated that and gave me space. It was a great feeling.”“It’s all about what I’m going to do in the future. I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play. We were so close to being one of the best teams in the world. We’ve slacked off in the past two years but knowing how close we were gives you that desire to get back there.”That slacking off, as he puts it, bottomed out with the 58 all out in Auckland – “It was like the pins in a bowling alley falling down in slow motion” – from which a 1-0 series defeat followed. From being one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies in 2016, only for Pakistan to win at the Oval and square the series, England have five in the cabinet to match their world ranking of fifth.Root, Bayliss and the as-yet reformed selection panel have a job on their hands. The former is battling to turn half-centuries into three figures, too – his last nine have gone unconverted – and it is a topic Stokes has been discussing with one of his new friends in India.“But the thing about Joe is he doesn’t bat for himself. If he thinks it is time to take a team down, he will go for it. That’s how he wants us to play as a team and as captain, he feels he has to set the standard. People can have a go at him but the bigger picture, that’s what he is trying to build. When it clicks – and that is coming – those scores will become 150s and 200s. Hopefully when people read what I have said here they will understand a\u0026nbspbit\u0026nbspmore.”Doubtless much of the heat from the end of England’s sorry Test travails this winter was drawn by Australia’s ball-tampering scandal and before Stokes heads up to the dressing room at the Chinnaswamy, before his new team’s departure from the ground, his views on the topic are sought.“I’m keeping my mouth shut. Certain people said some things and it then comes back to get you\u0026nbsp…” he says, before stopping himself from elaborating on who and what he means. Given the aforementioned elephant, it is probably for the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb46629052be723656c7b8e2993158bca16fe2bd/0_173_4456_2675/master/4456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=833365eecb42a0adfaf643718215f3ad 1240w","title":"boston marathon first american desiree linden","story":"Desiree Linden splashed her way through icy rain and a near-gale headwind to win the Boston Marathon on Monday, the first victory for an American woman since 1985.The two-time Olympian and 2011 Boston runner-up pulled away at the end of Heartbreak Hill to win in 2hr 39min 54sec. That was more than four minutes better than second-place finisher Sarah Sellers – one of seven Americans in the top 10 – but the slowest time for a women’s winner in Boston since 1978.“It’s supposed to be hard,” said Linden, who wiped the spray of rain from her eyes as she made her way down Boylston Street alone. “It’s good to get it done.”Yuki Kawauchi passed defending champion Geoffrey Kirui as they passed through Kenmore Square with a mile to go to win the men’s race in 2:15:58 and earn Japan’s first Boston Marathon title since 1987. Kirui slowed and stumbled across the Copley Square finish line 2:25 later, followed by Shadrack Biwott and three other US men.“For me, it’s the best conditions possible,” Kawauchi said with a wide smile through an interpreter.On the fifth anniversary of the finish line explosions that killed three and wounded hundreds more, Linden and Kawauchi led a field of 30,000 runners through a drenching rain, temperatures in the mid-30s and gusts of up to 32mph on the 26.2mi trek from Hopkinton.In Copley Square, Crowds only partly thinned and muffled by the weather greeted Linden with chants of ‘U-S-A!’Lisa Larsen Weidenbach’s 1985 victory was the last for an American woman – before the race began offering prize money that lured the top international competitors to the world’s oldest and most prestigious annual marathon. Linden, a California native who lives in Michigan, nearly ended the drought in 2011 when she was outkicked down Boylston Street and finished second by two seconds during yet another Kenyan sweep.But the East Africans who have dominated the professional era of the race had their worst performance in decades. Kirui was the only Kenyan in the top 10 for the men’s race defending champion Edna Kiplagat, who was ninth, helped prevent a shutout in the distaff ision.Hometown favorite Shalane Flanagan, a four-time Olympian and the reigning New York City Marathon champion, finished sixth after popping into a course-side portable toilet before the halfway point and falling behind the lead pack.Marcel Hug of Switzerland earned his fifth wheelchair victory, pushing though puddles that sent the spray from their wheels into his eyes. American Tatyana McFadden, won the women’s wheelchair race for the fifth time, wore two jackets, with a layer of plastic between them and hand warmers against her chest.“It was just tough, it was so freezing,” Hug said through chattering teeth as a volunteer draped a second towel around his shoulders. “I’m just very glad that I made it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5974e54e22510bc0c5db1aaed8016c0dbbcc0205/218_225_4659_2796/master/4659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7ce3618633b1cdc369384e7207c4141d 1240w","title":"gold coast commonwealth games finale birmingham 2022","story":"The organisers of Birmingham 2022, possibly daunted by following an event so well received on the ground, may have felt some relief as the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games ended on a bum note.Furious spectators and even the host broadcaster condemned a closing ceremony that barely paid a passing mention to the athletes. Usain Bolt, paid to be here by a telecommunications company and still the biggest draw even eight months into retirement, was on the DJ decks and a Kylie Minogue impersonator featured.But the athletes had already been seated before the show began, an outrage which reached the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. “I’m just as disappointed as anyone else,” she said. “We wanted to stand there and celebrate our athletes and it didn’t happen. Whoever was responsible for making that decision should hang their head in shame.”A mea culpa followed from the Commonwealth Games chairman, Peter Beattie. “We wanted to get the athletes in early but we made a serious error of judgment by not having them in the broadcast,” he said. “It was driven by concerns about the welfare of athletes but they should have been involved. There were too many speeches, I shouldn’t have spoken because it bored the athletes silly.”A potentially more serious oversight unfolded on the marathon course when the Scottish runner Callum Hawkins collapsed with heat exhaustion and was left on the road for several minutes without medical attention as spectators snapped selfies. He was released from hospital on Monday.These were rare errors from an organising committee which delivered 11 days of slick operations, mostly full stadiums and a notable absence of traffic jams, helped by the exodus of locals scared off before the Games began by regular warnings of impending chaos.Where Birmingham could struggle to compete is with the stunning vistas, particularly the sandy beaches and turquoise waters that provided the backdrop to the open-air aquatics centre and the volleyball stadium. The venues for the gymnastics, cycling and netball were sold out for almost every session, pumping with music and entertaining sport.The only disappointment was that many of England’s leading names failed to perform. The Brownlee brothers arrived slightly injured and left without medals. Max Whitlock was outshone on the pommel horse by the 17-year-old Rhys McClenaghan from Northern Ireland. The world indoor champion hurdler Andrew Pozzi and the Olympic medallist hammer thrower Sophie Hitchon faltered, and Adam Peaty was beaten in the pool for the first time in four years.But at least they showed up. Bolt was bemused that some of England’s best sprinters, including CJ Ujah, who had every chance of winning a 100m medal, did not travel. Sebastian Coe, the president of athletics’ governing body the IAAF, was also surprised. “My gut instinct is try to not sit out championships because they are important at the end of your career,” he said. “When you turn your cards over it’s medals that people judge you on, not fast times in the Diamond League.”These Games will be recalled in England not for the medal table but for the netball team, who provided the most thrilling and unexpected result by beating Australia. The tales of perseverance and triumph against the odds also cut through. The weightlifter Zoe Smith, who has battled injury, funding cuts and worked as a waitress between training, won silver, just days after having an epidural to ease agonising pain.No stranger to heartache was the 400m hurdler Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands, who won gold only months after his coach was killed by Hurricane Irma.Tom Daley produced a performance which will live longer in the memory than any perfectly executed back 3½ pike. “There are 37 countries in the Commonwealth where it’s illegal to be who I am hopefully we can reduce that number,” he said, calling on the 37 of the 53 countries where homosexuality is illegal to change their laws.Given that number was 43 four years ago in Glasgow, it is not a hopeless plea. Where other sporting bodies scarper at the mere mention of politics, the Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, David Grevemberg, actively promotes discussion of human-rights issues.The Rwanda women’s beach volleyball team were encouraged to wear black armbands to mark the 24th anniversary of the genocide, while Australia’s indigenous culture, which it still wrestles with, was a major part of the opening ceremony.The question which pervades every Commonwealth Games is “do they really matter?” From a sporting perspective it is impossible to argue they compare with the Olympics or a world championships. But the Games has shown once again that they offer something wholly, often wonderfully, different."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/531460b1fa9d58dd6bedfc3e28a45a3bfd673ae7/6_281_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bd30a972b65e455ff0f6bd798e6fe9f5 1240w","title":"wayne pivac scarlets welsh rugby champions cup semi final leinster","story":"The storming run to a European Champions Cup semi-final against Leinster has reunited a proud rugby town and brought the fans flooding backAfter the Scarlets had beaten La Rochelle last month to reach their first European Cup semi-final for 11 years, Phil Bennett closed his eyes and was transported back to Stradey Park, the ramshackle, resonant ground where he had made his name as a fly-half from the end of the 1960s when Carwyn James coached Llanelli, where style mattered as much as winning.The Scarlets moved out of Stradey in 2008 and the ground was turned into a housing estate. Their new stadium held 4,000 more spectators but it was rarely more than half full. “Some people never made the move here,” says Bennett, sitting in a café-bar at Parc y Scarlets that is open every weekday. “It took time to work but the region has never been in a healthier position: the kids, the lifeblood of any club, are coming back.“A team ingrains itself in your soul when you are young. My father took me to Stradey Park when I was a small boy. I watched giants of the game and became a Scarlet forever. I still savour those days and matches I played there, not least the victory over the 1972 All Blacks, but we can move on now. The crowd stayed in their seats for some 15 minutes after the La Rochelle game, singing songs and applauding the players. Big men broke down. Parc y Scarlets was born.”The Scarlets face Leinster in Dublin on Saturday in their fourth European Cup semi-final. Like Bennett, the region’s Wales wing Steff Evans was taken to Stradey Park as a young boy and fell in love with his hometown club. “When I was growing up, all youngsters wanted to do was play for the Scarlets,” he says.“That is coming back, as you will hear if you go to any school in the area. I have never known a buzz about the town as there has been in the last few months. People are talking not just about the old days but a new era. It was not long ago that we were playing before small crowds because the rugby was not there, but thousands of supporters will be in Dublin and every week is a final for us.”Bennett credits a New Zealander with the revival: Wayne Pivac, a former policeman and Auckland head coach who arrived in Llanelli in 2014 as forwards coach, put in charge six months later. “The history of this place is not lost on me and it was a reason I came here,” says Pivac. “So was the expansive game they play but it took a time to turn things around. Finance had a bit to do with it but, to be brutal, the environment was not that honest. Now no short cuts are being taken by anyone: we spend so much time together it has to be a home away from home. Everyone is treated the same: we mix old-fashioned values with good practices of the modern game. We are in it together.”Pivac consulted a number of people who had coached in Wales before joining the Scarlets and received conflicting advice about whether to live locally or commute from Cardiff and avoid the goldfish bowl. “I live in Llanelli, by the beach,” he says. “People here are not shy and I chat to them in the supermarket, the petrol station, wherever. They have a passion for rugby and know a lot about it. No one has been rude. I do not hide away and prefer to update supporters rather than have rumours flying about. I have the same approach with the media. I am really enjoying living in Wales and feel part of the rugby fabric.”To JJ Williams, who was part of the Llanelli side that defeated the All Blacks, Pivac is a contender to take over from Warren Gatland as Wales’s head coach after next year’s World Cup. “I used to think there was no heart and soul in regional rugby,” the former Wales and Lions wing says. “It is coming: the Scarlets are playing a good brand of rugby and so are Cardiff Blues, who have made the Challenge Cup semi-finals.“The Scarlets are showing what can be achieved on a relatively small budget: I admire what the English clubs have achieved in growing the game there, but the rugby is not great in the Premiership. Supporters in Wales are more discerning: they want to be entertained and the Scarlets are doing that. Wales could do a lot worse than Wayne Pivac.”The Welsh Rugby Union, which has drawn up a shortlist of three to succeed Gatland, has spoken to Pivac. “They sounded me out over a coffee and I assume they have done that with all the regional coaches,” he says. “There has been nothing formal and it is about how they see the future. I have signed on for another two years at the Scarlets, as have the other coaches here, and we enjoy what we are doing.“Having 10 Scarlets in the Wales side that beat Scotland showed we are contributing to the game. We played some sublime rugby in the play-offs last season, but you cannot just throw the ball around. You have to have a platform and the way we fronted up at forward against La Rochelle and before them Toulon showed the character and determination of this group.”The Scarlets are underdogs in Dublin, but they have been since losing their opening two pool matches and being within two minutes of going down to Treviso in the third. They finished by running Bath off the Recreation Ground and not flinching against Toulon’s muscle. “Bath supporters came up to me at the end and said they had not seen rugby like that for a long time,” says Bennett.“I used to help with the marketing here but now the game the team is playing is selling itself. This is our breakthrough season. The emotion is back, we’re still here and Parc y Scarlets is our home now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85cea50007d012e47b19564b4e56e4bf1d6aa1e2/41_0_2579_1548/master/2579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6204c96a69ad49a00cac825bfddd94e8 1240w","title":"facebook people first ever mark zuckerberg harvard","story":"I remember when, at Harvard, my friends and I heard about a new website that promised to enhance our lives. Fourteen years later I see how wrong we were Fourteen years, two months, and eight days ago, I made a mistake. Like a lot of mistakes made at the age of 20 inside a college dorm room, it involved trusting a man I shouldn’t have, and it still affects me to this day.No, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t give me herpes. But in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, I have been thinking back to my decision to sign up for thefacebook.com on the site’s fifth day in existence, and I am struck by the parallels between Zuckerberg’s creation and a pesky (if generally benign) virus. Facebook isn’t going to kill me, but it has wormed its way into all of my relationships, caused me to infect other people, and I will never, ever be fully rid of it. Last week, Zuckerberg was called to answer for himself. Over the course of two days of questioning before Congress, Zuckerberg sought to assure the public that we, not he, are in “complete control” of our relationships with Facebook. He repeated this guarantee dozens of times, returning again and again to the idea that users can control their Facebook data.But the Zuckerberg of 2018 sounds suspiciously like the “Mark E Zuckerberg ’06” who was interviewed by the Harvard Crimson on 9 February 2004 about his brand new website. It was this article that prompted my roommates and I to start entrusting a stranger behind a computer screen with the keys to our identities: names, birthdates, photographs, email addresses, and more. “There are pretty intensive privacy options,” he told the paper. “People have very good control over who can see their information.” “On Facebook, everything that you share there you have control over,” he told Senator Dean Heller just moments after failing to give a straight answer on whether Facebook has ever collected the contents of its users phone calls. “You can say I don’t want this information to be there. You have full access to understand all, every piece of information that Facebook might know about you, and you can get rid of all of it.”Zuckerberg was lying then and he’s lying now. We do not have “complete control” and we never have, as evidenced by the fact that even people who never signed up for Facebook have “shadow profiles” created without their consent. He has been getting away with this same spin for 14 years, two months, and eight days. Watching him dissemble in front of Congress, I couldn’t help but see him as one of those fresh-faced boys at Harvard who transitioned seamlessly from their New England prep schools to the Ivy League, and excelled at maintaining steady eye contact with the professor while they opined about books they hadn’t read.I can still remember our excitement and curiosity for the new website that promised to enhance and replace the physical facebooks that Harvard passed out to first-year students. Those thin, hardcover volumes were a frequent source of useful information and prurient entertainment. We used to pore over the book, trying to figure out the name of this guy from class, or that girl from Saturday night, judging the looks of other students and generally indulging in a kind of pre-cyber cyber-stalking: it was a way to learn things about other people without having to ask them directly. Zuckerberg’s website broke the facebook out of its bindings. During those first weeks and months, we bore witness to Facebook’s power to reorient social interactions. With Facebook, you were friends, or not friends in a relationship, single, or “it’s complicated” popularity was easily quantifiable those who chose not to sign up for Facebook were defining themselves as abstainers, whether they wanted to or not. All of the beautiful and painful mess of human interactions was reducible to a data point in the social graph.We embraced this recalibration of social relations without thinking about who or what was behind them. Judging strangers based on their facebook photo transitioned seamlessly into judging people based on their Facebook profile and Facebook habits. It’s embarrassing to remember now my own decision, born of a hefty sense of my own too-coolness, that I would only ever respond to other people’s friend requests, and not send any myself, as if this were a meaningful form of self-definition. I’d like to think that I spared a thought for the motivations of the man behind the computer screen, but I’m sure I didn’t. Even if I had thought to assign a word, let alone a value, to the idea that I should maintain control over the pieces of information by which others would come to know and judge me – “privacy”, I think we call this – I probably would have been taken in by Zuckerberg’s assurances in that first Crimson article that his website was perfectly safe.The truth is that Facebook’s great value has come from making the rest of us lose control. Yes, we can decide what photos and status updates and biographical details we plug into Facebook’s gaping maw. But the most valuable insights have been gleaned from the things we didn’t even realize we were giving away. Facebook knows what I read on the internet, where I want to go on vacation, how late I stay up at night, whose posts I scroll quickly by, and whose posts I pause to linger over. It knows that I took reporting trips to Montana and Seattle and San Diego, despite the fact that I have never allowed it to track me by GPS. It knows my father’s cell phone number, despite the fact that he has never signed up for its service, because I was stupid enough to share my contacts with it once, several years ago. It knows all of these things that are, in my opinion, none of its goddamn business. If I’ve learned one thing from Mark Zuckerberg it’s that the most valuable knowledge about another person comes from learning things about them that they wouldn’t tell you themselves.So here’s what I know about Mark Zuckerberg. During those first few weeks of Facebook’s existence, while he was assuring his fellow college students that we could trust him with their identities, he had a private conversation on instant messenger with a friend. That conversation was subsequently leaked, and published by Silicon Valley Insider. It is as follows: ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvardZUCK: just askZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, snsFRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one?ZUCK: people just submitted itZUCK: i don’t know whyZUCK: they “trust me”In the intervening years, I’ve learned that Zuckerberg values his own privacy so much that he has security guards watching his trash, that he bought four houses surrounding his own house to avoid having neighbors, that he sued hundreds of Hawaiians to sever their claim to tiny plots of land within his massive Kauai estate, and that he secretly built tools to prevent further private messages from coming back to haunt him. What I haven’t learned, or seen any sign of, is that he has changed his opinion of the intelligence of his users. It’s Zuckerberg’s world, and we’re all just a bunch of dumb fucks living in it.

Last month a teenage boy was given a £5,000 cruise in exchange for his Snapchat username while accounts on Instagram are sold openly on online marketplaces. Shady brokers stalk the web searching for the most potentially lucrative handles, convincing their owners to part with them before reselling at a significantly higher price.“It’s funny some people don’t know the true value of a handle,” says another trader on condition of anonymity. “For example, I used to look for three-letter acronyms. The handle would generally go for around $30 but little do they know people look for specific @’s correlating with their business. I’ve flipped $20-$40 to $700 on multiple occasions.”Elsewhere, people allege their accounts have been phished, and their handles stolen and sold, yet Twitter has apparently not implemented robust systems to prevent the practice.“Twitter has yet to go after the hackers or phishers, let alone the legitimate account sellers, like myself,” says Philly. “Phishing an account is as easy as downloading an infected program, ticking a couple options and hitting run.”“They used social engineering strategies with multiple other services and sites (like Amazon),” says Josh Bryant, a designer at a digital product firm, who documented how he almost lost his handle in a blog post.“The why is just money. I own both @jb on Twitter and Instagram and there’s a huge economy for desirable usernames right now. If a hacker can get them, list and sell them before the site responds they stand to make a pretty healthy profit.”Another user claims their username was taken by Twitter itself. “A broker kept approaching me, and when I declined his final offer, a formal complaint was made to Twitter, by whom I don’t know, and the handle was handed over to JPMorgan,” says Chase Giunta, a software developer who previously owned the handle @Chase.“I always assumed JP Morgan would want it since they’re the largest bank in the US, but I also assumed they, or maybe even Twitter, would contact me directly to set up some kind of exchange – not some shady broker.”Twitter, however, does not permit the trading of usernames. It explicitly states: “Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.” This does not seem to have stopped them changing hands, though.“After his last offer, I received action from Twitter,” says Giunta. “The steps they took to take my account down were incredibly unsettling. They sent me automated emails claiming I was impersonating Chase Bank, which I wasn’t, before they took the username from me.”“Of course, in hindsight, I would’ve accepted his last $20,000 offer. But I thought I was doing the ‘right thing’ by turning it down at that time.”This sentiment was echoed by Patrick de Laive, the founder of The Next Web, who was offered $20,000 for @patrick by an athlete.Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity to prevent handle squatting. In the early days of the social media giant, this meant people could contact the administrator and request inactive handles.A former Twitter employee told the Guardian how they could request unused usernames for themselves and family. Others have since demonstrated the relative ease in which enterprising people can secure their desired handle.“I got my first name as my Twitter handle after a six-month campaign that included some light Internet stalking, badgering staff at Twitter, $250 and a visit to the patent office,” says Haje Jan, a director at Bold, a venture capitalist company, whose first name was taken by an inactive user.“I registered a web domain for my first name to strengthen my case (in case the trademark people decided to look any deeper), then forked over my £170 to the Intellectual Property Office, registering Haje™ as a trademark.”“Armed with the trademark I contacted Twitter’s support team and about a week later, I received an email saying that I could either create a new account or move the username to an existing account. Mission accomplished – and it turned out to be easier than I anticipated.”It’s not just iniduals who have bought up desirable usernames. The state of Israel bought the @israel handle for reported six-figure sum in 2010, while CNN employed the owner of @cnnbrk as a consultant in exchange for transferring them the account.“Twitter has always been very clear that it’s against their terms and conditions to sell usernames but that hasn’t stopped people trying,” says Sue Llewellyn, who trains journalists to use social media. “They also frown upon people squatting on usernames – ie creating an account and not using it.”“Frankly I think if a big name celebrity wanted a specific name that wasn’t being used then they could probably get it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

So, take a seat in the mighty arena alongside 12,000 spectators (togas optional)The first gladiator is down, flailing his gladius towards the emperor before being pummelled by a giant hammer (thankfully, into a furrow of sand left by one of the racing chariots). Two “slaves” rush on and drag his body off towards the spoliarium. Suddenly, everyone is up out of their seats: the retiarius (net man) has dropped his trident and the mirmillones (fish men) are closing in.Nîmes’ Les Grands Jeux Romains (Great Roman Games) is one of the biggest re-enactment spectaculars in Europe. Sitting among 12,000 handkerchief-waving spectators in the city’s first-century Roman amphitheatre last year, I realised it makes for a mesmerising and charmingly-brutal event. Having already featured Hannibal (2015), Cleopatra (2016) and, last year, Boudicca, this year’s games, which take place from 28-30 April, is devoted to Spartacus.“The first Great Roman Games was held in Nîmes in 2010 with little publicity,” says Valérie Espin, in charge of the games’ organisation company, Culturespaces. “The idea was just to have some chariots parading around the arena and people dressed up as Romans. But it has captured the public’s imagination and now there is a cast of 500 performing in front of 32,000 spectators over three days.”In the corner of Espin’s office is a giant scutum (curved Roman shield) and on top of her filing cabinet, a pair of gladiator helmets. “Participants take it very seriously,” she says. “Most of the re-enactors meet weekly, dress up as Romans and spend the weekend on camps, training for battles, preparing Roman food, testing equipment and living as Romans.”This year there are 28 different Roman associations taking part: 11 from France, 16 from Italy, one from Croatia and, for the first time, a group from Britain, Legio Secunda Augusta.“Seven of us are going to Nîmes from our gladiator group based in Portsmouth,” says dental nurse and weekend gladiatrix, Alisa Vanlint. “All the names we use are authentic the Second Augustus Legion was based in Britain for a while.”It’s also the first time female gladiators will fight at the games. “I am Achillia and will be fighting Amazonia – the names come from a marble relief in the British Museum.”Vanlint teaches stage combat and also re-enacts medieval and “1805” battles but her favourite is Roman. “I love sharing an amazing piece of history.” She will appear in the oval arena straight after the horse chases and then as a slave in Spartacus’s army in the second part of the show. Other members of Legio Secunda Augusta are soldiers and civilians.“The helmets are heavy but once you’re fighting, the adrenalin kicks in and the longer you wear it the easier it becomes. I don’t notice it after a while, it’s the same with cuts and bruises,” says Vanlint.Outside the arena, the city’s street’s will also be hectic with Roman revelry. There’s a Roman market selling asses’ milk cosmetics, oil, grapejuice and honey followed by a night-time parade with flaming torches. A Roman galley is on the esplanade and local restaurants will serve Roman-style food, while children solve clues in a treasure-hunt-enigma game.Restoration of the arena will continue for another 12 years. “Repairs of the terraces have given us another 130 seats this year,” says Espin. “Many of the local buildings contain stones looted from the amphitheatre and replacements come from the same Nîmes quarries as they did in Roman times.Besides the arcaded amphitheatre, Nîmes also has the Maison Carrée temple and the Tour Magne. All three can be visited on a combined ticket (€13 adult, €11 child, family ticket €40). Nîmes’ will also see its spectacular new Musée de la Romanité open on 2 June, with 3,500 square metres of multimedia exhibition space dedicated to Roman mosaics, sculptures and everyday objects. Its first exhibition, Gladiators: Heroes of the Colosseum, runs until 24 September 2018.There are also the ruins of the Temple of Diana, as well as two Roman city gates and the Castellum that collected water carried in from Uzès across the Pont du Gard viaduct.• Adult from €15, child from €5, Les Grands Jeux Romains, 28-30 April, arenes-nimes.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59221629a955ac31157ebfca07459a99a98b0dc/0_125_1532_1260/master/1532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=414e0a55a9d5b21139f2360261fedcf9 1240w","title":"aubrey plaza legion interview weird exhausting not being human","story":"How do you play a gender-fluid psychotic figment of a mutant’s imagination? The star of the superhero psychodrama reveals all – and explains why her friends can’t watch itAubrey Plaza finds it hard to describe her character in the TV superhero drama Legion. Is she alive or dead? Good or evil? Human or mutant? Real or a figment of the lead character, mutant David Haller’s imagination? “That’s a really, really good question,” says Plaza, before saying that Lenny Busker began as a human woman, then became trapped in a dimension of Haller’s mind, and has now been stranded by the evil Shadow King on the “astral plane”. It’s “a total mindfuck”, says Plaza. “It’s mentally and physically exhausting to not exist as a human. At the end of the day I would just feel like nothing, just this rag doll that’s been thrown around.”Legion’s strangeness might be stifling, but the 33-year-old has long specialised in disconcerting kooks. She is best known for playing April Ludgate in Parks and Recreation, a sardonic and contrarian member of the low-level local government department who spends her days spouting morbid soundbites and making people feel uncomfortable. It was a part written especially for her after a casting director told the show’s co-creator Michael Schur that she had met “the weirdest girl” and he should work her into the sitcom.Soon, it would become obvious to everyone that Plaza’s strangeness wasn’t confined to the screen. In 2013, for reasons she would later refuse to explain, she stormed the stage at the MTV Movie awards and attempted to wrestle Will Ferrell’s award from his hands. On YouTube, people began making compilations of her eye-wateringly awkward chatshow appearances, characterised by eerily deadpan jokes and a thousand-yard stare. Plaza’s oddball shtick has been convincing enough to earn her some high-profile gigs: over the past decade she’s brought her singular sensibility to a swath of comedies, from Judd Apatow’s Funny People to the frankly alarming Robert De Niro vehicle Dirty Grandpa. Last year, however, Plaza took her eccentric persona to new dramatic heights in the comedy-drama Ingrid Goes West, which she also produced. As Ingrid, a lost and lonely young woman who obsesses over and eventually infiltrates the life of an Instagram influencer, Plaza was both peculiarly amusing and hauntingly sad.Ingrid Goes West is a brilliant distillation of the compulsion and deceit hardwired into platforms like Instagram for Plaza, it was a message that really hit home. “In Ingrid, you have someone who already has enough trouble having normal healthy relationships, then you give them a device that lets them play out their most toxic impulses,” she says over the phone from her home in Los Angeles. “And I think on a smaller scale that’s what’s happening with everyone on social media.”Plaza briefly deleted her Twitter account in 2016, signing off with the message: “Dear Twitter it’s been fun but I’ve realized you are wrong for me and maybe the world.” She explains that she has “such a hard time” with social media. “Most of the time it just makes me feel bad. I know the feeling of being scared not to engage with social media because you feel like ‘I’m going to lose these connections and lose this awareness of myself’, but it’s all bullshit. I haven’t been on Facebook in over 10 years. It’s changed nothing in my life, I don’t think about it at all.”Though it’s adapted from a Marvel comic, Legion, which returns for its second series this week, certainly isn’t your average superhero fare. With Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley at the helm, it’s set in a retro-futurist 1960s universe, and spends less time on deafening fight scenes and more on goofy dance routines. Another thing that differentiates Legion from the rest of the Marvel universe is its depiction of mental illness. Haller, played by Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens, and Plaza’s character Busker originally meet in Clockworks psychiatric hospital, where the former has received a schizophrenia diagnosis as a result of the “voices” he is able to hear. Once Haller is rescued, however, he is told that those voices are not symptoms but telepathic powers. In a world where television shows from Mr Robot to Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are tackling mental health with increasing sensitivity, Legion’s equation of mental illness and superheroism has ided critics, with some praising Legion’s detailed depiction of the condition, and others criticising the show for using schizophrenia as a flimsy way to court thrills. Busker begins (and, in some senses, ends) her life in a psychiatric ward, so I’m interested to hear Plaza’s take on the issue. Yet while she acknowledges her character had “addiction problems”, Plaza sounds unclear about Lenny’s precise ailment, claiming “it wasn’t something that was ever labelled”. For that reason, she says, she didn’t do much research into the subject of mental illness in preparation for the role. Instead, she stresses the way the show mines horror from the disorientating nature of mental distress. “What is real, what is not real – it’s the overall question,” says Plaza. “Going mad is one of the scariest ideas for me. To not trust your own mind is a really frightening idea.”Legion is indeed frightening. A sense of nameless horror pervades every scene, as the grotesque monsters that plague Haller’s memories shift in and out of focus (“I have some friends who can’t watch it because they’re so disturbed by it,” says Plaza). Lenny was initially written to be played by a middle-aged man, with Plaza insisting all the original dialogue remained intact, meaning Lenny ends up both crass and subtly androgynous.It’s something that becomes especially apparent when Lenny is viewed in the context of the show’s other major female character Syd, a wide-eyed, girlish mutant who begins a romantic relationship with Haller. I ask Plaza how it feels to play a character whose gender seems so ambiguous. “I love it,” she says. “There’s a fluidity to Lenny and I just think it’s more interesting playing a character that’s not so identifiable. It’s really fun to decide how someone like that moves and looks - it’s allowed me to do whatever I want.” Sporting a curly bob and a selection of suits and dungarees, Plaza spends most of Legion physically unrecognisable - swaggering and manspreading, as well as cajoling and threatening Haller with a blokey air. But as time goes on and the Shadow King becomes more desperate, Lenny uses intimidation tactics that feel sexually loaded and sinister. “I think it’s really interesting when you have a character like that pitted against someone like David Haller,” says Plaza. “That dynamic was always really interesting to me because I feel like Lenny has a sexual energy to her, but it’s not always a feminine energy, it’s more kind of masculine.”Despite being possessed by the embodiment of evil, throughout all of this Lenny also remains Haller’s close pal from the psychiatric hospital, and Plaza interprets the original characters’ relationship as sexual too. “At times it feels like they’re just friends and at times it feels like there’s some kind of attraction there,” she says. Plaza’s next project is unsettling in a different sense. She stars in An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn, a film by Jim Hoskings, whose gross-out debut The Greasy Strangler proved to be one of the more curious films of 2016. Plaza describes it as a “quadrangle love story between four freaks”, and the film, which also features her Legion co-star Jemaine Clement, has already disturbed critics on the festival circuit (the Hollywood Reporter called it “strenuously weird”). It’s another eccentric addition to her CV, but Plaza still feels as if she doesn’t get enough odd scripts. “I like them strange,” she says. “I want more of them. I’ve always been drawn to weird movies, I loved John Waters and Christopher Guest growing up, and I’m always looking for stories you just can’t believe someone would think up.” Considering a dimension-hopping, mutant-baiting creature wasn’t enough to sate Plaza’s appetite for strange stories, you suspect that where weirdness is concerned, the astral plane’s not quite the limit.

You put it on and they gawp at footage of rivers, trees and bubbles until they have been lulled into a state of catatonia. It is, transparently, much more for parents than kids the closest thing you can get to spiking their milk with brandy now that society has come to frown on that.I have a feeling that – once word gets out – Daydreams will cross over into the mainstream. It is so artfully put together that, if BBC Four put it out under the slow-TV banner, it would probably break viewing records. The closest equivalent, at least superficially, is 2015’s Dawn Chorus: The Sounds of Spring, one of the very first pieces of slow TV to be presented to the British public. Images drift in and out of focus, sounds boil up to the surface then fade away without ceremony.There is no narrative to speak of with Daydreams, but it is all held together by a cohesive sense of feeling. Remember when, during last year’s Twin Peaks revival, people would tell you that the best way to watch it was to switch off the analytical part of your mind and just let it wash over you? The same applies here, although obviously Daydreams is better because it contains fewer Nine Inch Nails songs.It’s technically a kids’ show, though, so there is some narration. But it’s one with pedigree guiding you through the various dreamscapes is none other than Olivia Colman, intermittently drifting in to remind the young audience to “pause” and reflect on something they’ve just seen. And while I’m biased – possibly because no episode of Broadchurch has ever calmed down a manic child – there may be an argument to call it her best work. The music is by Tom Jenkinson, AKA Squarepusher, who delivers some of his gentle ambient rather than his drill’n’bass.The whole show is full of lofty reference points. In its extreme closeups of trees and streams and blades of grass, it draws parallels with peak Terrence Malick. In its soundtrack, which narcoleptically bobs and weaves as it draws everything into a satisfying whole, it comes off like a Boards of Canada production. And, in its final passage, as day turns to night and focus is dropped – and Daydreams becomes little more than a series of abstract shapes and colours – it becomes a kindergarten Kubrick. It’s heady, impressive stuff.Best of all, it works. Everyone in our house was ill last weekend, with the exception of our three-year-old, who insisted on ricocheting off every available surface, ignoring our pleas for mercy. As an experiment, I put Daydreams on. Not only did he, more or less instantly, calm down, but by the time it finished he was so relaxed that he fell asleep in the middle of his bedtime story. That may not sound too impressive, but in this household it’s seismic. We’re taking him on a long-haul flight in a few months. Try and stop me from downloading Daydreams to an iPad.If I had to be picky, I couldn’t call Daydreams perfect – one time-lapse montage of blossoming flowers comes a little too early in the show, and at that point it feels like an unearned abstraction – but it’s close. God, is it close.The mood that Daydreams creates is integral to CBeebies – its woozy, gentle Bedtime Hour is such a mainstay of modern parenthood that the channel is obliged to warn viewers of impending schedule changes weeks in advance – but this feels like a whole new level. Daydreams is an experience first and a programme second. If it wasn’t successful, you’d have to applaud the BBC’s audacity for making it in the first place. But it is and, next time I find myself unable to sleep, I may just find reach for it myself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395491836144d12f886d4835ba6a31ab87687ae9/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=90a177ef54ab7953351cad54af0bbd18 1240w","title":"tuesdays best tv stephen the that changed a nation","story":"This damning three-part documentary about the murder of Stephen Lawrence tells an immigrant story that feels buried in the past but also grimly relevant9pm, BBC OneDuwayne Brooks, who was with Stephen Lawrence on the night of 22 April 1993, is now middle-aged.

This week, plumbers, plasterers and electricians will arrive on the island. New windows still encased in packaging are stacked up on the floor, waiting to be installed. A prayer carpet has been ordered.Money and support, both moral and practical, have poured into the project after Rashid set up a crowdfunding appeal. Donations from around the world have pushed the sum raised well past the £50,000 target. Professional builders and tradesmen assisted by local residents, some also juggling their regular jobs, are working from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.Now, Stornoway’s Muslims – a few dozen people out of about 8,000 in the town – are hopeful that the mosque will be ready for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which begins in May. “It’s a big challenge to get it done in time for Ramadan, but we’ll do our best. Some things are out of our control, but now we have millions of people praying for us. It’s got a lot of momentum,” says Rashid.Muslims have lived in Stornoway since the 1950s, adapting to an island on which the Sabbath is still observed and churches retain considerable influence. Back then, some became travelling salespeople they lugged suitcases along roads winding through peatlands and past small lochs to offer fabric and other goods door to door until they had enough savings to open shops and buy homes for their families.But they never had a place of worship. Instead, prayers were held in people’s living rooms and the bodies of the dead were washed in garages. It could several days before an imam could come from the mainland to say funeral prayers.Over the years, some Muslims left the island for work, to join children and grandchildren who had settled on the mainland, or to be part of a bigger mosque-based community. But since 2015, the dwindling numbers have been boosted by the arrival of several families fleeing the civil war in Syria. The need for a mosque took on a renewed urgency.The community bought a derelict building in the town and planning permission to turn it into a mosque was granted last summer. Little headway was made until a friend of Rashid’s visited the island a few weeks ago.Rashid runs a construction firm that specialises in new-build properties but also has experience of building mosques. As well as raising money for the Stornoway project, he has negotiated discounts on supplies and called in contractors. “Suppliers have been very cooperative. Most of the people helping to build the mosque are non-Muslim,” he says.The response of other Stornoway residents has been mostly encouraging, according to members of the Muslim community. A woman turned up at the site this week with a cheque for £500. “This goes a long way to show the love and support we have been receiving from the people of Stornoway,” the mosque team tweeted.No members of the Muslim community wish to be quoted directly or named, saying they want to get on with the project quietly and peacefully. Some are especially wary of the media, which they say has tried to stir up isions in the town over the mosque and has routinely misrepresented Islam.The only strident opposition has come from the Free Church (Continuing), a small breakaway from the Free Church of Scotland. It described the mosque as a “most unwelcome development” in a statement issued last year that spoke of “the oppression of Christians and the reduced status of women under Islam” and of “militant Islamists or ‘jihadists’”.The church’s response to the mosque was guided by the biblical commandment to love God, says Greg MacDonald, moderator of the Outer Hebrides presbytery of the Free Church (Continuing). “On the basis of this biblical teaching, we object to the promotion of all false religion, including the promotion of Islam through a mosque in Stornoway. God’s right to be worshipped by his creatures in the way he requires must take precedence over any other supposed rights,” he says.In contrast, James Maciver, a minister with the Free Church of Scotland, the biggest congregation on the island, says he supports Muslims’ right to worship. “They have always been regarded by the local community as people who’ve contributed to the local economy and integrated well. I don’t remember any animosity towards them. Outsiders may have got the impression that the Christian community here have resisted the mosque, but that’s not the case,” he says.“I come at this from the point of view of liberty of conscience, freedom of religion. I don’t personally see Islam as the way to salvation, but they have a civil right to a place of worship. I have no right to come between someone’s conscience and their god.”Two Syrian women have been welcomed at his church’s parent and toddler group, Maciver says. “Local people simply take the view that their faith is their business. No one wants to disturb the peace.”Back at the mosque building site, work will begin on the interior once the roof is weatherproof. The prayer room will have a women’s section, ablution facilities will be installed and a separate mortuary will be created.Plans are already under way to invite Stornoway residents to the mosque for tea, to give people an opportunity to ask questions and get to know their Muslim neighbours better. “Christianity and Islam have very similar values, the same values in fact,” says Rashid. “Once we have finished building, we will have an open-door policy. Everyone is welcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef2a0d8f516fdecdeac8a62bb1bae6abeb389818/754_618_1781_1068/master/1781.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9fb15e25f5e7ffa9fce7975e8b5390dd 1240w","title":"commonwealth leaders choose next head after queen this week","story":"Ahead of leaders’ retreat, Theresa May makes clear that UK backs Prince Charles as next symbolic leader of organisationCommonwealth leaders could decide this week on who takes over from the Queen as head of the organisation, Downing Street has said.The news came as Theresa May prepared to address her fellow national leaders on Tuesday. The prime minister is expected to urge the Commonwealth to engage and inspire the next generation, and to pledge £212m to help a million girls get a better education.She also made clear the UK backed Prince Charles to be the new head of the Commonwealth. The position was passed from his grandfather to his mother but is not hereditary.May’s spokesman said Charles had proven a “proud supporter of the Commonwealth for four decades and has spoken passionately about the organisation’s unique ersity”.No 10 said: “Succession is a matter for the Commonwealth as a whole to determine. If any discussion did take place it would happen at the leaders’ retreat at Windsor on Friday. Decisions in the Commonwealth are made by consensus.”Commonwealth leaders are gathering in London for an executive session on Thursday, before a retreat at the castle.The organisation’s secretary general, Patricia Scotland, said the retreat was a chance for the leaders to talk one to one without outside interference.“On the retreat, the 53 leaders get to go away together with no agenda and just talk about all the things that they desire to talk about. That enables them to deal with some quite tricky, sensitive issues, but collectively, collegiately and as part of the family,” she said.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, had suggested on BBC television on Sunday that the figurehead role could go to a rotating president. “The Queen clearly is personally very committed to the Commonwealth but after her I think maybe it’s a time to say, well, actually the Commonwealth should decide who its own president is on a rotational basis.”Queen Elizabeth, who is 91, has been the symbolic head of the Commonwealth since 1952. Charles is heir to the throne in 16 of the 53 Commonwealth member states, which are chiefly territories that used to be part of the former British empire.In her speech on Tuesday, May is expected to warn that a failure to engage and inspire the next generation will see the Commonwealth dismissed as “an irrelevance”. She will say she is “confident about our chances of success” in building a “bright future” for the organisation.In front of an audience expected to include the Microsoft founder, philanthropist and anti-malaria campaigner Bill Gates, May is expected to pledge the money towards making sure children living in developing Commonwealth countries receive 12 years of quality education. She will also call on leaders to commit to halving levels of malaria by 2023."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59bac9f1b06bab3c96133e1cf6d56e1991b905f8/0_108_5278_3168/master/5278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f895d28a7778734e21cd55399a714d0 1240w","title":"japan offers to lend hand in chinas toilet revolution","story":"Home of the hi-tech toilet offers technological support to help Xi Jinping in his mission to update lavatories across the countryJapan has reportedly offered its expertise in the subject of high-tech toilets to China to help the nation on its mission to revolutionise lavatories across the country.In high-level meetings on Sunday and Monday, officials from China and Japan pledged to improve ties, from cooperating on North Korea to avoiding a global trade war, and potentially working together on infrastructure projects around the world.But infrastructure of a different kind was also on the agenda. Japan’s embassy in Beijing has reportedly been in talks with Chinese officials about Japanese support of China’s so-called toilet revolution.According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs, as well as two other ministries, have been seeking ideas from private companies including the inventor of the washlet, Toto, for how to help China.The idea was previously raised in December when Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic party, visited the Chinese communist party’s central party school in Beijing and proposed new areas of cooperation, including hygiene and quality toilets. Sino-Japanese toilet cooperation takes place as the two countries promise to reset relations that have been disrupted by territorial disputes. Japan has deployed toilet diplomacy in India and south-east Asia but its toilets have failed to catch on in major markets like the US.  In 2015, Xi launched a nationwide campaign to replace many of China’s squat toilets for foreign tourists as well as for domestic use. Xi described the mission as part of his country’s “revitalisation” and an important measure to “improve quality of life of the masses”.China’s National Tourism administration said it would build or upgrade at least 64,000 toilets between 2018 and 2020. In February state news agency Xinhua reported that China’s toilet revolution was “right on track”, with new bathrooms installed on most of the country’s high speed trains.There have still been hiccups. In January the tourism administration asked local officials to stop spending so much on toilet projects. A public toilet in the western city of Chongqing reportedly cost 1 million yuan (about £100,000).  “We don’t need local governments trying to outdo each other with five-star toilets,” Li Jinzao, director of the administration said in a news conference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2fef1a329d44d9a43fdf0dca64e8ad66653099e/0_119_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=92915ddf9e23c65928fd916a4503a0a1 1240w","title":"new zealanders deploy helicopters and thermal imaging to search for lost dogs","story":"Thousands of dollars, and hours, have been spent on searches for beloved canines at least three times in the past yearHelicopters, thermal-imaging equipment and thousands of volunteers are being deployed in the search for missing dogs in New Zealand, which has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the OECD.In three separate cases this year, the search for missing dogs has attracted huge resources, thousands of dollars in donations and filled hundreds of hours as desperate owners have scoured the bush for their best friends.On Sunday, Benny the beagle was found safe and well in Belmont regional park north of Wellington after being missing for nine days.Benny’s owners hired a helicopter and used thermal imaging equipment and a megaphone from the SPCA to search for Benny, who was eventually found by friends hiking through the bush, a mere 100 metres from where he’d first disappeared.In March, in a case described as “remarkable” and “unbelievable” by local media, Dunedin dog Meg was found alive five weeks after disappearing into the bush following a car crash.Search and rescue volunteers gave up their free time to co-ordinate rescue efforts, hundreds of people scoured hundreds of hectares of dense bush, and a drone was deployed to search from the air.Meg was evenutally found injured, sick and severely underweight on a farm not far from the crash sight.She was treated for free by the Dunedin Wildlife hospital, which received more than NZ$4,000 (£2,051) in donations for her treatment from donors, as well as the NZ$2,000 reward from Cunningham, which the local farmer who found Meg refused to accept.Local school children have sent Meg get well letters during her recovery, and she has been become known as the “megadog”, with more than 1,500 followers of her Facebook blog, charting her recovery.In March, Canterbury man Russell Waters hired a helicopter to search for his missing chocolate labrador Roger, as well as galvanising hundreds of volunteers to search.He also considered offering his boat as a reward for the person who found Roger.“He’s my best friend, he’s my best mate, he’s my life,” Waters told Newshub at the time.“It’s not a matter of wanting him back, it’s a matter of needing him back, really.”Roger was found whimpering in a ditch not far from Waters’s house, and vets believe he was hit by a car and couldn’t get home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42762ad2489cb444707a08cda7b14acd9056ff76/104_200_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8647216cd5f090ee5e62c8ec77837f61 10500w","title":"tuesday briefing fair wind at last for caribbean born citizens","story":"Amber Rudd vows to fix ‘appalling’ situation of Windrush generation … Brexit legislation piles up in parliament … and how sleep became big businessAmber Rudd vows to fix ‘appalling’ situation of Windrush generation … Brexit legislation piles up in parliament … and how sleep became big businessGood morning – Warren Murray back with you today.The government has made an unprecedented apology over the “appalling” treatment of Windrush-era citizens, who have been threatened with deportation and denied access to public services after being classed as illegal immigrants. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, promised to resolve their status within two weeks. “Frankly, how they have been treated has been wrong – has been appalling – and I am sorry,” said Rudd. “This is about iniduals, and we have heard the inidual stories, some of which have been terrible to hear.”The Guardian has been documenting a growing scandal over the past five months affecting an unknown number of people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean as children (often on parents’ or siblings’ passports) but were never formally naturalised or hadn’t applied for a British passport. Under the Conservative government’s “hostile” immigration environment policy they were unable to prove their right to remain in Britain.Rudd’s announcement came after the prime minister was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over Downing Street’s initial refusal to schedule a meeting requested by 12 Caribbean heads of government to discuss the problem at the Commonwealth summit in London. Anger remains, though, along with a degree of scepticism that fairness will now prevail. Satbir Singh from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said government policy had turned Britain into a “hostile society” and the Home Office into an “island of inhumanity and incompetence … This is the first time that the government has been forced to account for these deliberate decisions. We hope it marks the start of a conversation about how we treat all those who seek to make a life here.” Syria latest – Overnight, Russia has announced that chemical weapons inspectors will be allowed to visit Douma, site of the poison gas attack that triggered US, British and French air strikes against the Assad regime. The US claims Russia may already have tampered with the site. In Britain, Theresa May has told MPs there was no time to get UN approval before launching the air strikes in Syria. May dismissed Jeremy Corbyn’s criticisms and said waiting in such cases would effectively mean “a Russian veto on our foreign policy … It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria. We have not done this because President Trump asked us to do so. We have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do.”Brexit logjam – Almost half the bills needed for Brexit have yet to be introduced to parliament, it has emerged. Parliament will only sit for another 80 days before MPs are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal and it looks like the government will struggle to pass the necessary legislation before then. “It’s frankly embarrassing that, more than 10 months since the general election, the government hasn’t passed a single piece of Brexit legislation,” said Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister. Theresa May is meanwhile facing a possible defeat as the Lords debates an amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU. Rafael Behr says that at this point, leavers are able to exploit a “growing complacency and fatalism around Brexit”. There is no enthusiasm in parliament for May’s Brexit, he writes, but “parliament couldn’t be bothered to lead the way back”.Oliver and done with – Jamie Oliver has been forced to give up his Australian restaurants after the group was placed in the hands of administrators.

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition.

Get off my head. Don\u0027t keep doing that to my head.\u0026quotWhen paramedics were called, they noted injuries to his hand, burns to arms and legs which were being self treated with cling film.He was taken to Bedford Hospital\u0027s acute clinical unit and then to Addenbrookes Hospital.Miss Syed said: \u0026quotFive per cent of his total body surface was scalded.\u0026quotJudge Madge told Worth that as well as the violence she had carried out on her partner she had refused him adequate bedding and food.He said she would \u0026quotbelittle\u0026quot her partner and discouraged him from contacting friends and his family.\u0026quotShe accepts that she has in the past, on a number of occasions, used blunt objects and implements to strike him and that he suffered injuries as a result of her doing so,” he said.“She accepts using boiling or hot water to cause injury to him. She accepts that she has in the past used a knife to cause injury to her partner.\u0026quotHe suffered from hydrocephalus and had a vulnerable head and he became increasingly isolated.”Worth, who is now in a new relationship, was made the subject of a restraining order which prevents her from contacting her ex for an indefinite period.How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  British man arrested for allegedly kicking his Thai wife to death after accusing her of having an affair The incredible life story of actress Choi Eun-hee, abducted by North Korea and forced to make films for Kim Jong-ilForest Gate teen stabbed to death in latest London killingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainAlfie Evans\u0026#39 parents lose legal fight to have their son flown to Rome for treatmentAnt McPartlin given biggest ever drink-drive fine as he is told to pay £86k Russia to allow chemical weapons inspectors into Douma amid concerns attack site has been \u0026#39tampered with\u0026#39 Gardeners must prune roses, plant potatoes and mow the lawn in short spring window, experts warnWomen who want to conceive should adopt a healthy diet years earlierCanada withdraws diplomats\u0026#39 families from Cuba over mystery illnessComment: Windrush children like me are being put in an appalling situation.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of watching material can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well with post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This happens to be slightly more convoluted, but that should not put off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first Guardians, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)Guardians of the GalaxyGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead up the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 10)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed almost nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Avengers: Infinity War, Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Jessica Jones season two, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Cloak and Dagger season one, New Warriors season one, and the rest of Agents of Shield season five.

They briefly ran out of food and water, according to the Associated Press. Coralie Chun Matayoshi, chief executive officer of the Red Cross in Hawaii, said the county’s Department of Parks and Recreation offered to deliver food to the evacuees by personal watercraft. But a nearby business was also dealing with flooding and unable to provide the supplies to be delivered.

Last month, the International Energy Agency reported that Venezuela is and will probably remain “the biggest risk factor” in a global supply crisis that may soon tip the market into deficit.The desperate parents leaving their children at orphanagesThe speed of decline in production has been vertiginous, with output falling by 100,000 barrels a day in February, according to Bloomberg. The Central University of Venezuela says production is reaching its lowest point in 70 years.Most of the enormous oil reserves Venezuela has access to – almost 25 per cent of all the oil controlled by the world’s biggest producers – is heavy crude, and needs to be diluted with lighter oil to become a commercially viable product.In 2016, with its own industry failing to deliver, Venezuela imported diluents for the first time in its history. In the two years since, those imports have grown to as many as 200,000 barrels a day, mostly from the US, according to Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at Rice University in Texas.The long queues for food and medicine in Venezuela are now well documented, but lines of cars waiting outside petrol stations – something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, when petrol cost $0.01 (0.7p) per litre – are becoming more common.Filling your tank is still cheaper than drinking water in Venezuela, but the industry can no longer meet domestic demands – and is having to put exports first. Monaldi says that if production continues to fall to below a million barrels, the consequences could be catastrophic.“The domestic consumption of oil is around 450,000 barrels and Venezuela needs the exports to repay its debt with Russia and China,” he says.“They have to import for two reasons. One is the collapse of the refining infrastructure and the other is that its oil is naturally heavy so they need to import diluents to blend with their oil to re-export it.Grieving families teargassed by police after 68 killed in prison fireWhy Venezuela’s new bitcoin alternative is so controversialVenezuela’s most-wanted rebel shared his story, just before deathVenezuela plans to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency “One of the craziest things is that a part of Venezuela’s imports is for the domestic market, but given its price, they practically give gasoline away for free. They are importing barrels that cost $80 to $90 and selling them at $0.”Monaldi says the only hope is for a major change in politics. He estimates it would take a decade for Venezuela to go back to what it was, and maybe much longer than that.Venezuelan polling group IVAD suggests that elections next month are not looking good for President Nicolas Maduro. Of those polled, 77 per cent believe that the country needs a change of government, the main reasons stated being lack of food and medicine, insecurity and the high cost of living.The IMF expects the Venezuelan economy to shrink by 15 per cent in 2018, and the country is facing the worst decline of GDP in recorded history in Latin America. It estimates that by the end of 2018, the accumulated decline will be almost 50 per cent from its peak in 2013.Oil makes up more than 90 per cent of the nation’s exports, but a combination of government corruption, lack of investment and the migration of qualified staff have left the industry in ruins. It’s a crisis that has directly hit the country’s ability to import resources like food or medicine for the Venezuelan population.It is a vicious spiral. It is estimated that 10 per cent of the population has emigrated. Almost two thirds of all households have at least one family member living abroad. And among those 3 million migrants are young and competent workers who have escaped from a country that sinks deeper into crisis.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
