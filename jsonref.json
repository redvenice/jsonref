Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  \u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadShocking moment fight breaks out between two bus passengersPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, LondonMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetChilling moment gang carry drunk and \u0027drugged\u0027 girl from clubBizarre moment road rage driver throws pint of MILK at lorryShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageGot a spare £3m? Amazing Cornish waterfront property is up for saleBizarre moment pub flower seller puts her hand down woman\u0027s top    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027 \u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadShocking moment fight breaks out between two bus passengersPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, LondonChilling moment gang carry drunk and \u0027drugged\u0027 girl from clubBizarre moment road rage driver throws pint of MILK at lorryShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageGot a spare £3m? Amazing Cornish waterfront property is up for saleBizarre moment pub flower seller puts her hand down woman\u0027s top    Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027         Out of control bus causes cars to collide on main road\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlShocking moment fight breaks out between two bus passengersPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, LondonChilling moment gang carry drunk and \u0027drugged\u0027 girl from clubBizarre moment road rage driver throws pint of MILK at lorryMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageGot a spare £3m?

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                         In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia. But I no longer accept that everything which is going wrong in South of Italy, in Mezzogiorno, is explained by the fact that the EU or the European Commission would not do enough,\u0027 he said after leaving a meeting in Brussels.\u0027Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u0027He urged Italy not to \u0027play this game\u0027 of holding the EU responsible, adding \u0027Nations first, Europe second.\u0027 Political neophyte Conte skipped teaching a class at the University of Florence to return to Rome after he was summoned to meet Mattarella at the presidential palace on Thursday night.            In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Carlo Cottarelli (pictured) announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/00/4BEDF47900000578-0-image-m-6_1525650145624.jpg","title":"Children talk dress write properly 4 says Ofsted report","story":"    Children are starting school unable to speak properly, dress themselves or even use the toilet, claims the head of Ofsted.

I am convinced that Abramovich made this decision with the approval and possibly the explicit instructions of Putin.As we all know, Putin is cold-blooded and cut-throat when dealing with those who have offended him.He came to power 18 years ago through his unswerving commitment to crush Chechnya’s separatists. He went on to seize Crimea from Ukraine, is held responsible for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet carrying 298 people and his secret police goons have been accused of assassinating enemies such as tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko.In other words, Putin does not take kindly to being snubbed.The same applies to Abramovich, who learned the ways of the world at Putin’s feet.The friendship between the two men goes back nearly a quarter of a century.One persistent, though unconfirmed, rumour, is that when the ailing Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was looking for a successor in 1999, Abramovich – then a young man with powerful business allies – suggested that Putin should be made prime minister. Yeltsin did just that.  Roman Abramovich (left with ex-wife Dasha Zhukova), who was last pictured at Chelsea with Guus Hiddink in December (right), is said to have personally pulled the plug on the £1billion stadium plan after his visa row Abramovich, who started life in Moscow as a mechanic, selling retreaded tyres as a sideline, acquired substantial stakes in the oil and gas industries as the Communist state broke apart.If mystery surrounds some of his early business deals, there is no mystery about how he hangs on to his wealth: he maintains a tungsten-strength friendship with Putin.Putin never lets old enmities die, and Abramovich is the same. When Abramovich fell out spectacularly with his business associate Berezovsky, the pair faced each other in court in 2012.Berezovsky claimed £3billion in damages from Abramovich for intimidating him into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft.The Chelsea owner won the case, in which legal costs were estimated to be £100million.

That said, Putin understands how powerful a weapon sport can be.          Mr Abramovich is a known ally of Vladimir Putin and has found his visa application at the centre of a row between Theresa May and the Russian President over the Salisbury poisoningHe cynically turned the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the Black Sea coast, into a gigantic ego-trip for himself. He will do exactly the same with this month’s football World Cup which he is hosting in Russia.But he is offended by criticism of Russia’s human rights record and can’t be happy that Prince William and British politicians will not attend the tournament – a decision made following the Salisbury poisonings.To some extent, Abramovich’s behaviour is blatant retaliation on behalf of his buddy in the Kremlin.I believe this might be just the start of Abramovich’s cold-shouldering of Britain.If Britain doesn’t want him, he doesn’t want Britain.Asked once where he considered home, he said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow, I feel most comfortable.’That love of London has died.Just before Christmas, amid claims that the Russian government had meddled in the Brexit referendum, Putin’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov admitted: ‘It’s no secret that our relations are at a low point.’Without doubt, after the Salisbury poisonings and Abramovich’s eruption yesterday, it’s clear that relations have got much lower.Mark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/22/4CCC365000000578-0-image-a-6_1527803010343.jpg","title":"Thousands fly UK arent asked passports","story":"    Airport blunders have allowed up to 11,000 passengers over the last five years to enter Britain without going through passport control, figures show.The problem has been blamed on human errors such as incorrect doors being opened at arrival gates.More than 11,000 did not have their passports checked in the usual way from 2013 to the end of 2017 immediately after landing.Figures released by the Home Office show that 2,328 were misdirected last year – an average of six a day.

They claimed the shoes were \u0027too soft\u0027, which allowed his foot to become stuck in the side skirt.The devastated mother, however, insisted that the escalator\u0027s manufacturer should bear the responsibility because the machine didn\u0027t stop in time. Ms Li claimed the escalator dragged her son along until she had to press the emergency button at the bottom of the staircase, according to Chinese news site The Paper. She also accused the shopping mall\u0027s staff of not rescuing her son until firefighters arrived around half an hour later.A shopping centre spokesman said a fail-safe was built into the escalator, but it does not immediately stop the device in order to prevent people on the device from falling over.The spokesman  insisted that the escalator had been properly maintained.He added that the mall\u0027s staff didn\u0027t rescue the boy instantly because they didn\u0027t want to cause \u0027unnecessary harm\u0027 to the child. The boy was freed after the shopping mall\u0027s staff dismantled part of the escalator.            Mao Mao was with his mother, Li Yan (pictured), and his 10-year-old sister at the timeMao Mao underwent four-hour emergency surgery after being taken to the Tianjin Hospital, reported The Paper.A doctor told the news site that Mao Mao suffered bone fractures in five or six places on his foot. His blood vessels and tendon broke as well.The doctor was quoted saying that Mao Mao was still in critical condition and could face an amputation.Medics are waiting to see how his foot responds to treatment. The incident is  being investigated further."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/12/4CCE786700000578-5794867-The_open_plan_kitchen_dining_room_amazing_views_as_well_as_acces-a-39_1527850929457.jpg","title":"Stunning seven bedroom waterfront home St Mawes sale","story":"    A sweeping driveway leads to a parking forecourt by the property\u0027s swimming pool and lower ground floor entrance          The property is just over a half a mile walk away to an excellent range of shops, restaurants, pubs.

Spain sacked the Catalan regional government led by Puigdemont after a declaration of independence that followed a banned secession referendum on October 1.It has blocked any attempts at independence in the courts, citing the constitution which says Spain is inisible.

Pictured: Stacks of cash recovered from one Albanian gang\u0027s drug supply business Drug gangs generally prefer to use cash to deposit vast sums of money, because it is \u0027relatively untraceable, readily exchangeable and anonymous\u0027, says the NCA.The social and economic costs of serious organised crime, including drug supply and money laundering, are estimated to be £24 billion a year, while the UK drugs market is worth around £4 billion a year. The NCA has the monumental task on its hands of bringing down the estimated 5,800 organised crime groups - comprised of around 40,600 iniduals - who were operating in the UK as of December 2014An influx of Albanian drugs gang members who have flocked to Britain have seen them take control of much of the UK cocaine supply. Ministry of Justice figures in March revealed there were 726 offenders from the Balkan state behind bars last year – up from 267 in 2013.          Major players include Khalad Uddin, 35, who was jailed for 16 years last JuneAlbanians now make up the third largest foreign group jailed in England and Wales, behind Irish and Polish criminals – at a cost of around £53million to the taxpayer. Some 321 inmates are there for drug offences, far outweighing the next highest foreign group, Jamaicans (122) and Poles (85). They were jailed for crimes ranging from murder, drug dealing, sex offences, money laundering, people smuggling and death threats The gangs\u0027 ruthlessness has the NCA to warn they pose \u0027a serious threat\u0027. Major players include Khalad Uddin, 35, who was jailed for 16 years last June. He was described as the \u0027kingpin\u0027 in an elaborate drug dealing network that spread from his homeland to the Midlands, Bristol and London.Before he was snared by the police, Uddin lived in a plush apartment in Oxford and had a fleet of seven cars including a Range Rover and a BMW 7 Series. His extravagant lifestyle led police officers to raid his home where they found about £460,000 in cash bundles, 70 pairs of designer jeans valued at up to £700 each and expensive jewellery.   Lulezim Zefi (left), 36, was the gang\u0027s leader, which also included four mules who were arrested after a raid by National Crime Agency officers on April 27 at a Brentwood retail park.

trying to bring a...Share this article\u0027Britain in fast becoming the biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe\u0027 Britain is becoming Europe\u0027s number one cocaine marketplace, according to security minister Ben Wallace.This has contributed to an upsurge in violence which has seen 67 people, most of them youngsters, killed in the capital alone in 2018.The problem has also spread from urban areas to the suburbs and even rural districts.Mr Wallace added: ‘Young people have the ability to order drugs, and gangs have the ability to have delivered to their door large packets of drugs from Albanian or Serbian drug gangs.’          Drug lord Klodjan Copja was jailed for 17 years and it is estimated his ultra-violent gang of fellow Albanians imported as much as £150million of cocaine into the UKDuring the court case, it emerged that one of his couriers was watched by police as he made weekly trips to a lay-by in Maidstone, Kent, where he would meet a lorry carrying imported cocaine from the continent. The courier would then supply the drug to organised crime groups in London, Birmingham, Leicester and Nottingham.Until he was caught using a fake passport on the Greek-Albanian border and extradited to Britain, Copja was a master of evasion.The Albanian gangs have worked hand-in-hand with drug cartels in Colombia, where the coca leaf is grown. The consignments arrive in south-eastern Europe and are then moved on to the UK or elsewhere (Antwerp is the Albanian mafia-controlled port in the north, I was told).Much of the cocaine is turned into crack cocaine, which is even more potent. The profit margins are far bigger, which is why Copja’s is not the only UK-linked drugs gang from his home town of 140,000 people.Official statistics support the contention that Albanian nationals have achieved a significant position in the UK’s underworld. They are now the third largest foreign national group in our jails, after the Irish and Poles, both of whom have freedom of access to Britain thanks to historic ties or EU membership.A National Crime Agency league table of more than 4,000 UK criminal gangs also showed that Albanians had overtaken Romanians to rise to third place in the league, behind only Britons and Pakistanis. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/16/4CD1B91500000578-5795495-image-a-109_1527865536508.jpg","title":"World

They claimed the shoes were \u0027too soft\u0027, which allowed his foot to become stuck in the side skirt.The devastated mother, however, insisted that the escalator\u0027s manufacturer should bear the responsibility because the machine didn\u0027t stop in time. Ms Li claimed the escalator dragged her son along until she had to press the emergency button at the bottom of the staircase, according to Chinese news site The Paper. She also accused the shopping mall\u0027s staff of not rescuing her son until firefighters arrived around half an hour later.A shopping centre spokesman said a fail-safe was built into the escalator, but it does not immediately stop the device in order to prevent people on the device from falling over.The spokesman  insisted that the escalator had been properly maintained.He added that the mall\u0027s staff didn\u0027t rescue the boy instantly because they didn\u0027t want to cause \u0027unnecessary harm\u0027 to the child. The boy was freed after the shopping mall\u0027s staff dismantled part of the escalator.            Mao Mao was with his mother, Li Yan (pictured), and his 10-year-old sister at the timeMao Mao underwent four-hour emergency surgery after being taken to the Tianjin Hospital, reported The Paper.A doctor told the news site that Mao Mao suffered bone fractures in five or six places on his foot. His blood vessels and tendon broke as well.The doctor was quoted saying that Mao Mao was still in critical condition and could face an amputation.Medics are waiting to see how his foot responds to treatment. The incident is  being investigated further."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/15/4CCE875500000578-5795477-image-a-24_1527864466021.jpg","title":"Chinese money launderer ordered repay 400 000","story":"    Fen Chen, 32, was caught paying an astonishing £2.8million into high street banks for the organised criminal gangA money launderer who deposited millions into high street banks has become the latest to be ordered to repay her ill-gotten gains.Fen Chen, her friend Ying Lin, 27, and two associates took bundles of bank notes into dozens of London banks, amounting to £2.8million between 30 July and 15 August 2016.  The 32-year-old was jailed for six years and three months in November last year. NCA officers arrested her shortly after she accepted a bag containing more than £300,000 from Albanian Fation Koka, 30, in the car park of an Asda supermarket in Park Royal, north west London, in August 2016.Koka was jailed for 21 months and will be deported upon completion of his sentence. Lin was deported after serving a 14-month sentence.Chen, of Park Royal, agreed to hand over £317,487 at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.NCA financial investigations manager Mark Bannon said: \u0027Fen Chen was a prolific money launderer and criminals like her are at the centre of serious and organised crime because they enable other high end criminals to clean their money.          Officers from the National Crime Agency  arrested her shortly after she accepted a bag containing more than £300,000 from Albanian Fation Koka, 30, in the car park of an Asda supermarket in Park Royal, north west London, in August 2016\u0027Money laundering is a priority threat for the NCA.\u0027Pursuing confiscation orders on top of criminal convictions is a weapon we can use to hit offenders in the pocket.\u0027We will keep hunting for any more assets Chen has.\u0027Cops also found £180,000 cash was discovered in bags and hiding places at Fen\u0027s flat, and a cash counting machine.Text messages were also found on phones which showed another cash handover took place in the same car park on July 31, 2016.  Another £180,000 cash was discovered in bags and hiding places at Fen\u0027s flat along with bank slips detailing hundreds of deposits totalling £1.8 million. Pictured right: Fation KokaChen was convicted of four counts of money laundering at Kingston Crown Court and in November was jailed for a total six years and three months.At the time, NCA operations manager Kevin Gee said: \u0027Fen Chen was a prolific money launderer, able to process millions of pounds in cash in a very short period of time.\u0027Chen was caught red handed in possession of around £300,000 belonging to an Albanian drugs gang.\u0027Organised crime groups rely on money launderers like Chen, who play an integral part in allowing them to benefit from and re-invest their criminal profits.\u0027Taking money launderers out of the chain, as we have done here, makes life far more difficult and more risky for crooks trying to clean their dirty cash.\u0027It comes after three drugs traffickers who were jailed for 83 years over a plot to bring 500 kilos of heroin to the UK were last July told to hand over almost £1.4 million.Mohammed Farooq, 51, Homayon Mehrpoor, 61, and Ahmad Shah, 44, were part of a conspiracy to smuggle heroin – concealed in vegetables and bed linen – with a street value of £306m into the UK.

Pictured: Stacks of cash recovered from one Albanian gang\u0027s drug supply business Drug gangs generally prefer to use cash to deposit vast sums of money, because it is \u0027relatively untraceable, readily exchangeable and anonymous\u0027, says the NCA.The social and economic costs of serious organised crime, including drug supply and money laundering, are estimated to be £24 billion a year, while the UK drugs market is worth around £4 billion a year. The NCA has the monumental task on its hands of bringing down the estimated 5,800 organised crime groups - comprised of around 40,600 iniduals - who were operating in the UK as of December 2014An influx of Albanian drugs gang members who have flocked to Britain have seen them take control of much of the UK cocaine supply. Ministry of Justice figures in March revealed there were 726 offenders from the Balkan state behind bars last year – up from 267 in 2013.          Major players include Khalad Uddin, 35, who was jailed for 16 years last JuneAlbanians now make up the third largest foreign group jailed in England and Wales, behind Irish and Polish criminals – at a cost of around £53million to the taxpayer. Some 321 inmates are there for drug offences, far outweighing the next highest foreign group, Jamaicans (122) and Poles (85). They were jailed for crimes ranging from murder, drug dealing, sex offences, money laundering, people smuggling and death threats The gangs\u0027 ruthlessness has the NCA to warn they pose \u0027a serious threat\u0027. Major players include Khalad Uddin, 35, who was jailed for 16 years last June. He was described as the \u0027kingpin\u0027 in an elaborate drug dealing network that spread from his homeland to the Midlands, Bristol and London.Before he was snared by the police, Uddin lived in a plush apartment in Oxford and had a fleet of seven cars including a Range Rover and a BMW 7 Series. His extravagant lifestyle led police officers to raid his home where they found about £460,000 in cash bundles, 70 pairs of designer jeans valued at up to £700 each and expensive jewellery.   Lulezim Zefi (left), 36, was the gang\u0027s leader, which also included four mules who were arrested after a raid by National Crime Agency officers on April 27 at a Brentwood retail park. Right: Admir Simeqi, 41, who was observed delivering 3kg of cocaine to other menIn December, members of an Albanian drug smuggling gang who stashed vast quantities of cocaine inside car dashboards were jailed for a combined total of 43 years. They hid the drugs in compartments that could only be accessed by pressing a combination of buttons on the dash and a USB cable, Kingston Crown Court heard.Lulezim Zefi, 36, was the leader of the gang, which also included four mules who were arrested after a raid by National Crime Agency officers on April 27 at a Brentwood retail park.          In December, members of an Albanian drug smuggling gang who stashed vast quantities of cocaine inside car dashboards were jailed for a combined total of 43 yearsAdmir Simeqi, 41, was observed delivering 3kg to Gergi Marku, 25, before dropping another 2kg to Marku and Admir Bici, both 26. A further 4kg haul was later found stashed inside a hydraulic concealment in the boot of Simeqi\u0027s car.In total, the drugs seized had a potential street value of at £720,000.Zefi met with his lieutenants Valon Bajgora, 34, and Valentin Malocaj, 36, at a restaurant in West Hampstead, northwest London, where all three men were arrested.The group had been under surveillance for weeks prior to their arrests and were seen to meet frequently at cafes, restaurants and their home addresses.          Searches of premises linked to the gang found a further £110,000 in cash as well as sets of weighing scales and equipment found to contain traces of cocaine and cutting agents.

trying to bring a...Share this article\u0027Britain in fast becoming the biggest consumer of cocaine in Europe\u0027 Britain is becoming Europe\u0027s number one cocaine marketplace, according to security minister Ben Wallace.This has contributed to an upsurge in violence which has seen 67 people, most of them youngsters, killed in the capital alone in 2018.The problem has also spread from urban areas to the suburbs and even rural districts.Mr Wallace added: ‘Young people have the ability to order drugs, and gangs have the ability to have delivered to their door large packets of drugs from Albanian or Serbian drug gangs.’          Drug lord Klodjan Copja was jailed for 17 years and it is estimated his ultra-violent gang of fellow Albanians imported as much as £150million of cocaine into the UKDuring the court case, it emerged that one of his couriers was watched by police as he made weekly trips to a lay-by in Maidstone, Kent, where he would meet a lorry carrying imported cocaine from the continent. The courier would then supply the drug to organised crime groups in London, Birmingham, Leicester and Nottingham.Until he was caught using a fake passport on the Greek-Albanian border and extradited to Britain, Copja was a master of evasion.The Albanian gangs have worked hand-in-hand with drug cartels in Colombia, where the coca leaf is grown. The consignments arrive in south-eastern Europe and are then moved on to the UK or elsewhere (Antwerp is the Albanian mafia-controlled port in the north, I was told).Much of the cocaine is turned into crack cocaine, which is even more potent. The profit margins are far bigger, which is why Copja’s is not the only UK-linked drugs gang from his home town of 140,000 people.Official statistics support the contention that Albanian nationals have achieved a significant position in the UK’s underworld. They are now the third largest foreign national group in our jails, after the Irish and Poles, both of whom have freedom of access to Britain thanks to historic ties or EU membership.A National Crime Agency league table of more than 4,000 UK criminal gangs also showed that Albanians had overtaken Romanians to rise to third place in the league, behind only Britons and Pakistanis. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/01/16/4CD1B91500000578-5795495-image-a-109_1527865536508.jpg","title":"World

As western companies, including Sony, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and BP’s Castrol, have pulled out of sponsoring the tournament after the Fifa bribery and corruption scandal, Chinese firms have secured an unprecedented presence at Russia 2018. When Russia kicks off against Saudi Arabia in the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on 14 June, fans will be treated to a seven-minute advert for Mengniu Group’s inner Mongolian milk and drinkable yoghurt. The commercial will be aired during each of the 64 games in the tournament. Spectators fancying an ice-cream will have to pick from unfamiliar names such as Mood for Green, Ice+ or Suibian SuiXinGuo, after Mengniu secured exclusive rights to sell sweet treats including yoghurt drinks in the stadiums. Other unfamiliar names to get to grips with during the month-long tournament include: Vivo, a mobile phone firm producing China’s version of the iPhone at a fraction of the price the TV and fridge maker Hisense the electric scooter company Yadea and Dalian Wanda, a conglomerate controlled by the multibillionaire Wang Jianlin. The dominating presence of Chinese brands comes despite the country’s national team failing to qualify for Russia 2014 or the previous World Cup in Brazil.Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, said: “As Fifa is now seen as a toxic brand that many western companies do not want to be associated with, China is seizing the opportunity.Chadwick said the lack of demand from western companies to sponsor the World Cup in Russia, and Qatar in 2022, has left Fifa “desperate for cash, and Chinese companies spotted the opportunity for a relatively cost-effective way to get their brands in front of billions of global eyeballs”. Wang, the fifth-richest person in China with a $23.4bn (£17.6bn) fortune, according to Bloomberg’s billionaires index, said: “Two or three years ago, Chinese and Asian companies probably wouldn’t even have had a chance to sponsor Fifa even if we wanted to. But because some western companies dropped out, we got the opportunity.”Wanda, which owns the British luxury yacht builder Sunseeker, the Hollywood studio that made Godzilla and The Hangover as well as a stake in Atlético Madrid, has signed up as a Fifa partner – the highest level of sponsorship – alongside Coca-Cola, Visa, Adidas and Russia’s Gazprom for the next four World Cups.“If more Chinese brother companies become Fifa sponsors like Wanda, we will join forces to advance the interests of China soccer,” Wang said. Chadwick said the Chinese companies’ Fifa sponsorship deals were encouraged by President Xi Jinping to help fuel his dream of turning China into a “world football superpower” by 2050. “China wants to host the the World Cup, China wants to win the World Cup, and I speculate they also want a Chinese president of Fifa,” Chadwick said. “Rescuing Fifa financially with these sponsorship deals will help the chances of achieving those dreams immeasurably.”After TV rights sales, sponsorship is Fifa’s biggest income stream and was worth $1.6bn for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The loss of sponsors and the struggle to sign deals after the bribery scandal dragged Fifa to a record $369m loss in 2016. Jon Tibbs, founder and chair of JTA, a sports reputation management company, said it was sensible of Chinese firms to use football for promotion. “As the traditional western brands get cold feet and face consumers’ pressure, it is inevitable that Fifa turns to new markets,” he said.“For Chinese brands seeking new markets it is relatively very easy and prestigious to partner with Fifa. It is widely believed that China will bid for the 2030 World Cup, obviously if there are a large number of Chinese sponsors helping to prop up Fifa that is a very good starting point.”Sam Burne James, news editor of PR Week, said Fifa was “certainly seen as toxic” by many British brands, and Boris Johnson’s comparison of the World Cup under Vladimir Putin to the 1936 Olympic Games under Hitler had not helped. “If you look at few tournaments back, most of the brands would be recognisable to western audiences, now several of them are unheard of – and that shift will continue,” he said. “Chinese companies get two things from sponsoring the World Cup. The first is access to western audiences that they will sooner or later be trying to win over, as their companies expand. The other is a cosmopolitan veneer to their brands, which they hope will resonate with their sizeable domestic markets.”Vivo, founded nine years ago, paid €400m (£350m) for a six-year deal that included Russia 2018, Qatar 2022 and the Confederations Cup. It has signed up the Brazilian footballer José Roberto Gama de Oliveira - better known as Bebeto – and Holland’s Ruud Gullit to front its World Cup campaign – and its advertising campaign video, launched this week, sums up the opportunity the Chinese corporate sponsors are trying to grab: “The world is watching,” Vivo said. “This is our moment.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce58f832da6fb9185f8e2000cc3652ba6852e88/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0d1098e9296df3be4171b88a8b9a92c1 1440w","title":"conservatives islamophobia muslim council britain","story":"The Muslim Council of Britain has given the party a long list of legitimate concerns. Now the ball is in Brandon Lewis’s courtThis week, the Muslim Council of Britain – of which I am assistant secretary general – wrote to the Conservative chair, Brandon Lewis, detailing the many incidents of unchecked Islamophobia within his party. The MCB chose its words carefully, explicitly refraining from calling the party inherently Islamophobic. But the letter did call for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia so that the Conservatives could acknowledge the problem and find ways to fix it.As chairman, Lewis is the person who could make a difference. But in recent weeks, he and the party’s deputy chair, James Cleverly, have played down Islamophobia among Conservatives despite the wealth of evidence to the contrary.Take Zac Goldsmith’s campaign for London mayor. The way devout Muslims were depicted in that campaign was described by Andrew Boff, the most senior Conservative in the London assembly, as “outrageous”. Yet, senior figures within the party appeared to take an active role in the strategy. Theresa May, home secretary at the time, declared Khan unsafe to run London because of an alleged history of defending extremists and David Cameron and the then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, falsely accused an imam associated with Khan of supporting Islamic State. The claim was later retracted (Fallon had to pay damages). After his mayoral defeat, Goldsmith remained in the party despite there being no apology, no acknowledgement of the racism of the campaign and despite the fact continued to state that Khan had links to extremism.One MP, Bob Blackman, shared an anti-Muslim tweet from the far-right activist Tommy Robinson in 2016, though he claims it was an “error”. He also hosted a hardline anti-Muslim Hindu nationalist in parliament. He was also a member of Islamophobic Facebook groups including Britain for the British. Just this week, he was revealed to have shared a tweet by the website ShankhNaad, which has been accused of publishing false stories designed to cause tensions between Hindus and Muslims.It’s not just MPs. Conservative candidates and councillors exhibit Islamophobia on a weekly basis. One shared a post that called Muslims “parasites”, another endorsed the idea that Muslims should be “repatriated” to keep Europe safe, and another was exposed as being a former “security adviser” to the British National party.This overwhelming evidence of Islamophobia is extremely serious and merits urgent action.Sayeeda Warsi, the first Muslim to serve in cabinet and the party’s former chair, believes there is a “simmering underbelly” of Islamophobia in the party. Lady Warsi raised her concerns informally and formally, including a letter to the prime minister last year, but on each occasion, she says the party “shrugged its shoulders” and did nothing.The decision by the MCB to issue a formal letter on this issue has not been reached lightly. The Conservative party has so far chosen to be defensive, rather than engage with the cases put forward.• Miqdaad Versi is assistant secretary general for the Muslim Council of Britain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d0d1d2e3c0e38130f9f81eefd0c842a63c5ea1c/574_247_2353_1412/master/2353.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=513198921c4d7e9b6b620cfcb11b918a","title":"yoko ono john lennon liverpool double fantasy","story":"She was labelled a witch and a band wrecker. Now, 38 years after the murder of her husband John Lennon, Yoko Ono has returned to his home town to tell their story“Your life is being conducted in front of the world, like a play,” Yoko Ono tweeted recently. “Know that it is, therefore, a play to people who watch it.” That Ono is on Twitter makes utter sense: her aphorisms were almost like tweets before the thing was invented. She has always been ahead of her time. People seem to have hated her in so many ways that I assume she must see herself as a character in a story in order just to live, just to continue being her own woman.She is here now in front of me, a tiny woman in her shades and her hat tending to the final details of her exhibition in Liverpool, Double Fantasy. I see apples on Perspex plinths, to replicate the apple that an apparently rude John Lennon took a bite of when he met her at the Indica gallery in London. Ono, who for so long was ageless, is now 85 and needs a bit of help. I am told she is feeling emotional. She doesn’t do jetlag, apparently. The next day she will visit the house Lennon grew up in and sit in his bedroom, feeling him close.“She took him away from us,” a man in a pub tells me. “But she has always come back to Liverpool. She has not forgotten us.” His friends agree. There is a grudging respect now for a woman who was once seen a wrecker of the Beatles, an evil foreigner who stole away and bewitched a jaded and stupefied Lennon.She was regarded as a manipulative, clingy, talentless fake who somehow enchanted the superstar Beatle. All the loathing that was poured onto Ono is now quite difficult to read: misogyny laced with out-and-out racism. The music press and the art world policed the boundaries of femininity then and now – and Ono did not fit. The poisonous Albert Goldman book, The Lives of John Lennon, ascribed every stereotype about oriental women to her. She was the evil dragon lady who played the mute geisha. Lennon was the weak, flawed man manipulated by this cunning, grasping creature. It was OK, in 1988, for Goldman to describe her as “simian-looking”, to speculate on intimacies he could not have possibly known about.No wonder Ono wanted to tell her tale of their relationship in the place of Lennon’s birth, though this is not a setting-the-record-straight show exactly. The exhibition is called Double Fantasy. Maybe their coupling was a fantasy, maybe all relationships are, but here that fantasy is set in the context of world events. A simple love story perhaps, but the context was the tectonic plates that were shifting in 1966: Vietnam and the civil-rights movement are the backdrop. Their art is their response.To see objects that belonged to the couple is strangely moving. Ono’s sunglasses positioned opposite Lennon’s wire NHS specs, the lenses mirroring each other. The loss registers. I had met Ono before at some post-gig meet and greet. I did not know what to say. Oh Yoko. She had been on stage screaming in the voice of an abused child. Sean Lennon, their son, was there so it seemed easier to chat to him. She did not seem one for small talk somehow. I wanted to tell her I had seen the Beatles as a tiny child, taken by my uncle and been terrified. It was the first gig I ever went to. I don’t think we had “health and safety” in those days and they just hit the girls off stage with brooms. It was just screaming and screaming.When Lennon was murdered, I was working in a restaurant in Miami and made huge tips that night because I was English and kept crying while serving diners. That’s a long time ago and the Beatles don’t seem much in fashion any more. Fashion of course is something Ono knows very well. She loves clothes. She is always in black and white and she knows what she is doing.In one film in the show, when Lennon is being interviewed by Michael Parkinson, he asks why the press are calling Ono ugly. Why is that acceptable? Lennon explains the public perception. “This Japanese witch has made him crazy and he’s gone bananas. But … all she did was take the bananas part of me out of the closet that, you know, has been inhibited by another part.”Often in interviews Ono sits smoking and silent. That became a familiar image, but now we know differently. Ono hung on to Lennon because he was so insecure he would not let her out of his sight for a second. Indeed, Double Fantasy helps to reconfigure their relationship in ways that may finally balance. Instead of her leeching off him, maybe he was leeching off her. Maybe it was mutual. She was an artist, involved in Fluxus. She knew all the luminaries such as John Cage and had exhibited internationally. Like Lennon, she was married with a child. Like him, war was in her background: Liverpool had been bombed, Ono had had to flee Tokyo. As a child, she said, she looked like a ghost because of food shortages. She also said she never pursued a guy, that it was never her style, and that she wanted an equal relationship. “You can’t love someone unless you are in an equal position with them,” she declared in 1971. Lennon came into the relationship a violent man who had hit his first wife and was often cruel. Ono confronted this. She talked too of bisexuality. In the same year, Lennon told the underground newspaper Red Mole that she was into liberation before he came along. “She had to fight her way through a man’s world – the art world is completely dominated by men.” He described her revolutionary zeal: “There was never any question we had to have a 5050 relationship or there was no relationship.”This attempt at a personal and artistic collaboration was much mocked. Attempting equality seemed to push them further into their own bubble. That and, of course, heroin. But what else was Lennon to do with the massive celebrity that was eating at him? While Kanye West uses his power to support Trump, his partner flogs appetite-suppressing lollipops. Lennon and Ono were after a somewhat bigger prize: world peace. A deconstruction of masculine power and fake action. They would attract the press to their cause by staying in bed.The bed-ins, indeed many of couple’s concepts, have been relentlessly pilloried as simplistic, as a bit Hallmark, a bit Zen, as somehow not real art because conceptual art was not in vogue as it is now. Ono’s Cut Piece from 1964 – invoking rituals around gender and identity, vulnerability and dissent, in which audience members could cut off her clothes – is pre-Abramović. Her film Rape, her use of nudity in performance, her interest in primal scream therapy, her insistence that everyone could be an artist, the idea that art was always to be made in process with the spectator and it is the interaction not the product that matters – Lennon imbibed all these things that now feel completely contemporary.Not everything she did with Lennon worked, that’s for sure. The boundary between art and life was blurred by celebrity and money. Yet so much of their relationship was seen through the prism of race and patriarchy. It was not that they had an open relationship or needed to rethink. It was that she arranged for Lennon to have an affair with her assistant May Pang. She is the arch manipulator.Alongside this, Ono is playing with the power of the male gaze and returning it, with nude pictures of her and Lennon that are not flattering but entirely human. She made a film of Lennon’s penis and called it Self-Portrait. This is the woman who we are always told has no sense of humour. In 1964, she too started thinking about the female gaze, screening a Hollywood movie with the instruction: “Do not look at Rock Hudson, look only at Doris Day.”It seems sometimes as if Lennon’s star has waned, while hers has waxed – with many artists and musicians acknowledging her influence. So it is quite something for her to go back to Liverpool to document all the collaborations she made with Lennon. She cannot escape being defined by him, but she now gives us the holy relics of their relationship and sets them in history. The famous ladder from the Indica gallery, his shirt, the glasses, the bedclothes, the funny surreal instructions: “Imagine the cloud dripping  Dig a hole in your garden to put it in.”She said she was saying: “Please accept me  I am mad.” But there is a steeliness in her madness, in her presence here. Lennon needed her and was desperate to come back to her and have a child. She challenged power and violence, rejecting the macho idea of fighting for peace. “I wonder why men can get serious at all,” she muses in her 1964 book Grapefruit. “They have this delicate long thing hanging outside their bodies, which goes up and down by its own will.” She was clearly not seeking approval.As I was leaving the gallery, I saw too that she is still an activist. She may be old but she is indomitable. The world still needs to be changed. An exhibit had to be altered as the figures required updating. It said: “Over 1,400,000 people have been killed by guns since John Lennon was shot and killed on Dec 8, 1980.” She needed that to be put right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1ad3c2a1f080684bed00f508ae332b5959183d/43_0_5671_3402/master/5671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ee8c57e3345b15d1351dea7dd9112a","title":"the joy of pints and pies how i learned to love uk holidays","story":"Travel writer Anna Hart on how she finally left her passport behind and learned to love holidaying at home in the UKFor most of my life, travel to me meant going as far as I could for as long as I could. I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston. It’s been satisfying to join up some of the dots and understand why post-industrial Birmingham became the birthplace of heavy metal music. And now, when I read a Daphne du Maurier novel like Rebecca or My Cousin Rachel, I can visualise the Cornish scenery she renders through words. I’ll never lose my lust for long-haul international travel, but learning to see the UK through the wide eyes of a visitor means I’ll never take home for granted again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023f29a85170eda53eb8ecd4ee1d932ab6ee3fc9/0_0_5651_3391/master/5651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597bff482d92a878015e406dd1722157","title":"quiz have you got the entrepreneur gene","story":"Dreaming of ditching the nine to five?

Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land. The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary. The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.” He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936ff2c32291263935d784420e37253a82d3c146/90_863_2085_1251/master/2085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5df1f78adc62c6caaa5af5d8c8dad7f","title":"the new york pigeon in pictures andrew garn","story":"Andrew Garn is a native New Yorker who grew up surrounded by the city’s ubiquitous pigeons.

Now she wants to change the entire industry’s attitude towards women. ‘I know I’m on the right course,’ she saysThe day we meet, the sky is black and the rain comes fast and heavy. Rose McGowan had walked into the hotel bar looking slight, but as she sits in an armchair, her back to the window, streaks of lightning flash outside behind her head and she looks, instead, like some sort of avenging angel. “I\u0026nbspwanted to show people around the world that you can strike at the head of power and not just bite at the ankles,” she says. “Because they can shake you off when you bite at the\u0026nbspankles.”When allegations of sexual assault started to surface about the film producer Harvey Weinstein late last year – he has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex\u0026nbsp– McGowan added her voice, early and loudly. The former actor had collaborated with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times journalists who broke the story in October, passing on information about the $100,000 settlement he paid her in 1997 after an alleged assault. When Weinstein turned himself in last week, McGowan tweeted: “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.” This week, a\u0026nbspgrand jury indicted Weinstein on rape and criminal sex act charges, which he\u0026nbspdenies.“I\u0026nbspcried the other night, finally,” she says. “I\u0026nbspwas asked a\u0026nbsplot when he was arrested: ‘How does it feel?’ And I\u0026nbsphadn’t really had time to process how it felt. I\u0026nbspwent to Central Park – it was around midnight – and I\u0026nbspjust cried. I\u0026nbspcried for the girl I\u0026nbspwas, I\u0026nbspcried for her. But today I\u0026nbspsmile for\u0026nbspme.”The aftermath of the story breaking has been “extreme” says McGowan, although she says she had been living through a\u0026nbspstrange and nightmarish time long before the articles came out. She alleges that, when he heard about her tell-all memoir, Brave, Weinstein hired investigators, including former agents from the Mossad, to follow her and infiltrate her circle. It sounds like an outlandish claim, but a New Yorker story corroborates it. (A Weinstein spokesman told the magazine: “It is a\u0026nbspfiction to suggest that any iniduals were targeted or suppressed at any\u0026nbsptime.”)For McGowan, Weinstein’s fall has been a\u0026nbsplong time coming. In 2016, she alleged on Twitter that a “studio head” had raped her and she had been working on her memoir – in which she would write about the 1997 assault – for more than three years. The book was finished, and she was proofreading it and sorting out a\u0026nbspfew legal issues,\u0026nbspwhen the New York Times and New Yorker stories about Weinstein dropped. Would she have published her book without them? “I\u0026nbspdidn’t want to,” she says. “I\u0026nbspwould have published it, but my goal was also to bring down a\u0026nbsppower structure.” She smiles. Without the press reports and other women – including Gwyneth Paltrow, Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino and Salma Hayek – coming forward, “I\u0026nbspthink it would have largely fallen on deaf\u0026nbspears”.One night, four years ago, McGowan was at home during a\u0026nbsppower cut. She lay in the dark, with time to think and no distractions, and decided she hated acting. “Not the act of acting I\u0026nbspjust hated every part of the system I\u0026nbspwas in,” she says. “It was like an alarm bell going off in my head: ‘Wake up: this life is not right for you.’ And it was like a\u0026nbspthunderbolt.” McGowan started behaving with all the freedom of someone who felt they had nothing to lose. In 2015, she tweeted a\u0026nbspcasting note that came with a\u0026nbspscript for an Adam Sandler film that asked actresses to show cleavage: “push-up bras encouraged”. She describes it as “the opening salvo”. Her agent fired\u0026nbspher.Then she started giving interviews, talking about the sexism and sexual abuse in the industry. She shaved off her long, dark hair which, she says, had been part of what Hollywood expected of her. “I\u0026nbspwent up against them. It was just not done, it’s supposed to be sacrosanct,” she says, laughing. She says that someone recently asked if she was persona non grata in Hollywood. “Well, they’re personae non gratae with me. Don’t I\u0026nbspget a\u0026nbspsay?”She has not behaved the way Hollywood expected her to, but she has also had a\u0026nbsptricky relationship with the #MeToo movement. It probably has much to do with how unconventional she is, as well as a sense that she just does not seem to care what people think about her, but there have been eccentric appearances on TV talkshows and a\u0026nbsppublic row with a\u0026nbsptransgender person at one of her book signings. When attenders at the Golden Globes wore black in solidarity, McGowan responded on Twitter, saying that “not one of those fancy people wearing black to honor our rapes would have lifted a\u0026nbspfinger” had she and others not spoken up. She has attacked prominent iniduals involved in the movement, such as Alyssa Milano, and been accused of self-promotion and glorification. How does she cope with that accusation? “That’s only stupid\u0026nbsp… people saying that. So I\u0026nbspdon’t have to cope with them at all. Why would I\u0026nbspwant this publicity? It’s asinine. If you follow me out on the street, people don’t say\u0026nbspthat.”Hers is an extraordinary life. Her father, whom she believes had bipolar disorder, came from a\u0026nbspchaotic family and, while using heroin in California, joined the religious cult Children of God and came off drugs. Her mother had run away at 15 and met McGowan’s father at 18. By 19, writes McGowan, “she was pregnant and in a\u0026nbspcult”.The next few years were horrific (my word she describes it as “tough”), disrupted by the violent and abusive men her mother took up with, an enforced spell in rehab (caused, she says, by her stepfather finding out she had taken a\u0026nbspsingle acid tab) and a\u0026nbspperiod being a\u0026nbsphomeless runaway. Eventually, she found herself back with her mentally ill father, who wouldn’t give her cutlery or a\u0026nbspproper bed because he said she wasn’t worth it. She would fantasise about murdering him, she writes in her\u0026nbspbook.It was when he told her she had to pay several hundred dollars a\u0026nbspmonth in rent that she answered an advert asking for movie extras. At 15, she appeared in a\u0026nbspfilm Class of 1999 one of the men involved in the film called her up to his hotel room and allegedly sexually assaulted her. And so began McGowan’s experience of Hollywood. She soon realised, she says, “that town is really built on sickness. Very early on I\u0026nbsplooked at the power structure, the figureheads, the silence, the closed ranks. Nobody tells. It operates like a\u0026nbspcult.” As a\u0026nbspwoman, she says she felt belittled and objectified, treated as inferior to her male colleagues: “I\u0026nbspalways knew that I\u0026nbspwas No 2 on the call sheet instead of No 1, even though I\u0026nbspwas the lead. Or nobody would listen to anything I\u0026nbspwould say, even if it could save a\u0026nbsplot of money or time on set. I\u0026nbsphad a\u0026nbspline on the inside of my mouth that I\u0026nbspwould chew, just bite down. Just suck it up, push the rage\u0026nbspdown.”It was 1997, during the Sundance film festival, when Weinstein summoned McGowan to his hotel suite. She had starred in the Miramax film Going All the Way and was shooting another, Phantoms. Her manager said she should go and meet him. Thinking the meeting was finished, McGowan writes, she walked down the hallway with Weinstein. Then, she alleges, he pushed her into a\u0026nbspsmall, dark Jacuzzi room, took off her clothes and sexually assaulted her. She says she faked an orgasm to get him to\u0026nbspstop.The complicity and cover-up followed. McGowan says her manager at the time, Jill Messick, told her it “would help her career in the long run”. Weinstein, trying to defend himself, released an email from Messick in January this year in which she said her memory of what happened in 1997 was that it had been consensual, if something McGowan later regretted. Messick had become publicly embroiled in the story and, in February, she killed herself. A\u0026nbspstatement from her family partly blamed Weinstein and McGowan, claiming that Messick, who had mental health problems, had been devastated by “one person’s attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey’s desperate attempt to vindicate himself”. McGowan responded with an Instagram post wishing Messick’s family “solace”, adding: “The bad man did this to us\u0026nbspboth.”After the alleged assault, McGowan says she approached a\u0026nbsplawyer who told her she would never win a\u0026nbspcourt case against him because “you are an actress. You’ve done a\u0026nbspsex scene.” Instead, she was given $100,000 by Weinstein\u0026nbsp– she says the money felt dirty and she gave most of it\u0026nbspaway.She carried on working, though. I\u0026nbspwonder why. It would have been appalling to have been hounded out of a\u0026nbspjob she loved, but, as she notes, she didn’t love it. She says she was famous by then, appearing in the TV series Charmed, and wouldn’t have been able to get another job outside the entertainment industry. I’m not sure this follows. More compelling is the reason she gives in her book: that she was terrified of being homeless again. “Safety isn’t a\u0026nbspfeeling I have known,” she says, talking about her childhood. “Not unless it’s self-provided.” What kept her going? She smiles. “I\u0026nbspalways knew I\u0026nbspwas right and I have always been one for\u0026nbspjustice.”For five years she appeared in the TV series, Charmed. She didn’t particularly enjoy it, she says, but she says it was a “strategic” move. “It was big all over the world. I joined in the fourth season and it was already a hit. When and if I managed to break this news, it would be newsworthy all over the world because I’d kept my celebrity level just enough to be newsworthy.”Brave by Rose McGowan is published by HarperCollins at £20.

Sterling explained in an Instagram post that it was a tribute to his late father.The Football Association has supported Sterling over the issue and Southgate addressed the subject before England’s friendly against Nigeria at Wembley on Saturday.“He knows he’s got our support, he understands how some people have perceived the tattoo,” the England manager said. “But in my view a tattoo is like any work of art. It’s a very inidual meaning, the intent is all with the inidual and the person.“What has been clear by his own statement and his own experiences is that he is not someone who supports or wants to promote guns in the way that was perceived at first.“It’s something he’s had to get on with this week, but he’s a very strong inidual and he’s looking forward to the game.”Sterling was two when his father was shot dead and Southgate paid tribute to the strength of character the forward has shown to reach the top.“I think the personal story of a lot of our players is quite remarkable,” he said. “People often highlight the issues, the faults, of all of the squad, but for so many of them it’s incredible they’ve got to the point they have.“They are a great example to young kids of what you can achieve with your life if you are dedicated, if you are focused. Raheem embodies that. Nothing is given to you in life, you have to fight all the way.”The Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard confirmed the squad had rallied around Sterling. “We’ve reassured him – that’s what friends are for, that’s what team-mates are for,” he said.Southgate confirmed Lingard would start against Nigeria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ac13df291d48f78962c1da7167d5e7d4eaed27/0_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86204abf9335da9c790619e7c33c13ed","title":"turmoil chelsea owner annoyed manager limbo players unsettled","story":"Chelsea’s owner of 15 years, Roman Abramovich, pulled the plug on the £1bn redevelopment of Stamford Bridge on Thursday having grown infuriated by the Home Office delaying the renewal of his investor’s visa, a move born of heightened tensions between Britain and Russia. The oligarch’s decision has been interpreted by some as the first public indication his enthusiasm for the club is on the wane. On the football side, doubts surround the future of Antonio Conte and the identity of his potential successor, while the team’s star player, Eden Hazard, awaits evidence the club shares his ambitions to challenge for the Premier League title. We address the key questions at a club in flux.The revamp of Stamford Bridge was Abramovich’s pet project. Increasing the capacity from 41,631 to 60,000, with its extra hospitality and commercial opportunities, would have driven Chelsea further along the road to long-term sustainability, allowing them to compete more easily with elite rivals within the restrictions of financial fair play regulations, while also providing an eye-catching legacy of the Russian’s tenure. The stadium is not even in the 60 biggest grounds in Europe. Yet Abramovich is understandably reluctant to invest heavily in a major project in the capital of a country where he has been denied a visa. The only problem is that, by putting the build on hold – and shelving the estimated £22m in community benefits associated with the plans – the owner has effectively opted against addressing the issue of long-term sustainability, and cast some doubt on his plans for the club.Apparently not, though he clearly has his issues with the British government. Chelsea insist Abramovich is as committed as ever to a club in which he has invested £1.17bn and into which he continues to pour money – £34m in the 2016-17 accounts – and that opting out of the stadium development does not have implications on the football side, though that will be tested in the weeks to come. The Russian is moving to Tel Aviv having gained Israeli citizenship and has reportedly withdrawn his British visa application now he will be able to visit for up to six months at a time (although not work in the UK). Being based abroad is hardly an issue. The Premier League’s elite clubs are all overseen by overseas owners. Yet if Abramovich makes his home in Israel, the stadium plans are shelved forever and Chelsea’s yearning for sustainability is never really addressed, what is his motivation for owning the club? Maybe he will still benefit from the profile but the possibility of a sale would surely be mooted. “If the visa issue isn’t resolved I think anything could happen,” said the club’s former chief executive Trevor Birch. “There’s obviously a great deal of concern around at the moment. But it’s eminently sellable as a club. With TV rights increasing, if Manchester United are valued at over £3bn then Chelsea would be valued at around £1.5bn, and very attractive.”Matters on the pitch feel almost trivial in contrast with the ownership issue but there is a desperate need to address the immediate uncertainty. Players emerged from their victory in the FA Cup final suggesting enough was enough, and some clarity is required over Conte’s future. He has secured major honours in each of his two seasons at Chelsea and is under contract for a further year, yet expects to be sacked having grated with the hierarchy for more than a season. He is none the wiser, however, as to whether he will be in situ when the players report back in July. Talks have taken place with Maurizio Sarri, who employed an England-based representative to smooth a move to the Premier League, but Chelsea are reluctant to pay for his release from his Napoli contract given the Italian club have already appointed his successor in Carlo Ancelotti. Some within the club have pointed to unsavoury incidents in Sarri’s past, and to the reality he is yet to claim a major honour. Laurent Blanc’s candidature has been discussed, though the Frenchman would feel like a stop-gap. Luis Enrique and Leonardo Jardim were the others in the frame, and Avram Grant’s name has cropped up, which would dismay the support. But there is no obvious consistency to the strategy in terms of the style of football any of the candidates might play. The process seems muddled and forced on the club by a fallout with Conte.The director Marina Granovskaia has been overseeing recruitment since Michael Emenalo’s resignation last November – no replacement has been made, though talks have taken place with prospective candidates – but is apparently in Russia and will return to work next week. Chelsea can pursue players who fit their criteria and run their favourites past the manager at a later date, and the wheels are in motion in terms of incoming transfers. Yet time is ticking down to that early deadline in August and Hazard will want evidence the “good players” he had stipulated must be purchased are being secured. Failure could have implications on whether Chelsea can tie their top performer down to a new contract. It is hardly helpful, either, that Thibaut Courtois will not address his contractual situation until after the World Cup as he enters the final 12 months of his deal. Chelsea have played the market shrewdly over recent years, raising funds through sales from first team and loan players alike. Having to replace their goalkeeper would be another unwelcome headache."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/450cd7e52111a646a02d714639d5ef0e9883dc2b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d90cf2b4b747b9b5b349e2690f9db7e","title":"community chest hendon fc fans","story":"It was still less than a week ago that an unusually emotional Champions League final featured a player from each side depart in tears before half-time and the losing goalkeeper, whose inidual errors swung the game, report the following afternoon that he “hadn’t really slept” as “the scenes are running through my head again and again”.Also last Saturday, Tom Cairney scored the only goal as he captained Fulham to victory in the Championship play-off final and declared his side’s promotion was “a dream come true. It feels incredible. It feels like an out-of-body feeling”. Meanwhile Steve Bruce, the manager of defeated Aston Villa, described “a feeling of utter disappointment for everybody”. “It was heartbreaking,” said their midfielder Josh Onomah, who had spent the season on loan from Tottenham. “I’ve got to get my head around the result. It was just so disappointing we lost.” John Terry cried on to the shoulder of Jack Grealish, said he was “absolutely devastated” and left the club within days.Whether on the pitch or in the stands, sport has a particular ability to toy with the emotions of all involved with the violent unpredictability of a cat with a field mouse, with the chance of ending the experience feeling only metaphorically chewed up. It is no accident the phrase “emotional rollercoaster” has been used by British national newspapers in football reports precisely 400 times over the past decade, averaging one use in every week of every football season.Hendon FC, who play at level seven of English football’s pyramid, are all too aware of the sport’s sometimes savage cruelty. They finished third in last season’s Isthmian League Premier Division to qualify for the promotion play-offs, in which they merrily thrashed Folkestone Invicta 4-0 in the semi-final before losing to Dulwich Hamlet after extra time and penalties with, in the words of the club’s own match report, a feeling among the players of “abject misery and exhaustion”.But though misery is never an emotion to be cherished, there is a certain pleasure to be had in sharing it, even if in Hendon’s case it would not be with an enormous number of people – average attendance last season was just 245. It is one reason why the club has decided that in the future they will offer free tickets to anyone “suffering from depression or loneliness or anything similar”, with anyone interested invited to contact the chairman, Simon Lawrence, at his personal email address.“If anyone comes forward and says, ‘I’m lonely’ or ‘I’m depressed’, the chances are they’re lonely and depressed,” he says. “It’s quite an admission, really quite courageous, to say to people that your life isn’t perfect. It doesn’t cost us anything to do something good.“Almost certainly, the person who gets the free ticket wouldn’t have bought one anyway but even if they would we lose out to the tune of £11, and I think we can live with that. And maybe somebody is going to come along – there might only be one all season – who watches a game and starts to feel like this is something they might want to be a part of.”This week Chelsea decided to put a £1bn stadium redevelopment on hold because of the “current unfavourable investment climate”. The plan, similar to that nearing completion at Tottenham, was designed to allow them to attract fans in sufficient numbers and to charge sufficient prices to allow them to compete with the Premier League’s other giants without the endless assistance of friendly bottomless-pocketed oligarchs.The focus on cash over community is understandable, and probably essential, at the highest level. Further down the pyramid, and particularly for a club such as Hendon, who have been in their own new stadium for only two seasons and are still establishing themselves in the area, those priorities are not so much reversed as totally intertwined.Hendon’s unusual offer may be intended to assist iniduals and to cement their place in their community but it was born of tragedy. Last November Dermot Drummy, one of the club’s greatest and best-loved players, a product of Arsenal’s youth system and later the manager of Chelsea’s academy and their reserves, died suddenly. In April the coroner recorded he had killed himself. Drummy had gone into first-team management at Crawley Town in April 2016 and had struggled after leaving the job 13 months later.“He was just an all-round good guy, with a really bubbly personality,” Lawrence says. “He was very loved and very well respected.

I went to his funeral it was as crowded a funeral as I’ve ever seen and I think everybody was just completely blown away.”The idea to offer free seats was the result of a conversation between Lawrence and a volunteer at the club on the day the coroner reached his verdict. Demand may be great or it may be nonexistent but it illustrates an awareness, certainly not unique to Hendon, that a club’s focus on fans cannot entirely be about how much cash can be squeezed out of them. “At Hendon if we were to be remembered not for the cups that we’ve won or the league titles that we’ve won,” Lawrence says, “but for doing some good things in the field of mental health, I certainly won’t be disappointed.”• In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

The standard modern answer to this ancient question, often based on research by the psychologist Thomas Gilovich, is that we regret inaction more than action: not things we do, but things we fail to do. I’ve long been sceptical, though. Can’t you simply rephrase any decision so it fits in either box? Leaving your relationship to embark on a round-the-world adventure might be a bold case of “doing something”, or it might mean shirking the hard but rewarding task of building a lifelong partnership. Having children clearly seems like an action – unless you’re doing it solely to comply with social expectations, in which case it’s surely a matter of failing to forge your own path. And so on. Clearly, when it comes to avoiding regret, we’ll need a better rule of thumb than just “do stuff”.Gilovich and Davidai are appropriately reticent about deriving life advice from their research, but I’m not: these findings are a powerful argument for figuring out what you truly want from life and giving it a shot, even at the risk of others’ negative judgments. Of course, the challenge is figuring out what that is. “Do what you want” risks becoming a call to impulsiveness and hedonism (and plenty of regrets, of both the ideal-self and ought-self varieties). That’s why I like the trick, with its roots in the work of Carl Jung, of flipping the question and asking not what you want from life, but what life wants from you. Looking beyond your immediate whims and desires, what’s trying to come into being through you?I’m not sure it matters whether or not we each really have, as Jung believed, a soul with its own agenda, distinct from that of the ego, struggling to make itself heard. When faced with a big life choice, just asking the question that way can be enough to cut through the noise, to the quiet place where you already know what to do. Do that thing you’re unlikely to regret it.Read this: contrary to stereotype, philosophers these days tend to avoid pondering the meaning of life. But in his 2015 book A Significant Life, Todd May bucks the trend. Living meaningfully, he argues, is less a matter of what you do than how you do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d9aebb9859d890ef9a4674af71459ff9caef0ea/0_253_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a149a54ebb1bdacfa639fbb86edf3b","title":"craft cider recommendations fiona beckett","story":"Cider sales are on the up as craft brewers scent a boom.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb0a78679566b4c8cfa6cd5fc5c40d3e9826ec1f/0_830_4656_2793/master/4656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e033a0be93d0f8cc0a629e5957c83f9","title":"martha kearney not enough women front landmark tv shows","story":"BBC presenter thinks more can be done on gender equality, despite improvementsWith “the honourable exception” of Mary Beard, women are still not getting the opportunity to front the big landmark television shows, Martha Kearney has said.Kearney, the newest member of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenting team, said there had been big steps forward in terms of gender equality on TV and radio but more action was needed.On television there had been a “real and important” shift over the past 10 years where “there isn’t an assumption that women have to retire at a certain age while men carried on much, much longer”, she said.But in a talk at the Hay literary festival in Wales, she added: “The only area where I think there may be still a gap are the big landmark television series so, with the honourable exception of Mary Beard, you don’t see as many women fronting, presenting those programmes. I don’t think you see women doing those kind of big series as much as the men do.”Kearney acknowledged there had been a lot of shock and anger when it became clear that men were being paid much more than women at the BBC.But she said: “We are very privileged people who earn a lot of money. If women who are strong and confident for a living … if we end up in this position, how much more difficult is it for people in other spheres of life?”She was on stage with Sarah Sands, the former editor of the London Evening Standard, who has been the Today programme’s editor for the past year.They were asked about the fact that John Humphrys is paid much more than his colleagues. Sands said Humphrys was one of the stars of journalism who had done his job a long time and had got his salary when the market was different. “We are seeing male salaries come down at the BBC and I think that will happen elsewhere, keep the faith, it will happen.”In a wide-ranging event, Kearney was asked about the Richard Madeley interview on ITV this week when he cut off the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, live on air when he refused to answer his question.Would she do that? “So tempted, so tempted. Would I be allowed to do that?” No, was the reply from Sands. The incident did though shine light on a wider subject, Kearney said, and the issue of saying what you think might be changing as a result of Brexit. “Everybody is so media trained but I think media trained in a really bad way.” Speaking to the audience, Kearney said: “You are all highly intelligent people, you know if I’m asking a question that a politician isn’t answering it, they go off into a long ramble about something completely different. Everybody knows.”Sometimes there were good and understandable reasons politicians did not say what they thought, but she added: “In a way Brexit has completely broken all those rules and maybe that will lead to a more mature political debate for us journalists as well as politicians. If we weren’t so quick to go ‘oh it’s a split’ we might be able to have a political dialogue where people would feel they could be more honest about other areas.”Kearney replaced Sarah Montague on the team in April Montague moved to BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme.She recalled her first day. “I was incredibly nervous, which may seem odd because I am very experienced … but doing the Today programme is a different threshold, it is one of, if not the most, important programme the BBC produces.“I didn’t sleep very well, I kept thinking of the things that could go terribly wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14521350b3a6d20740a4b13ccdbfa20560e3747d/0_0_3578_2145/master/3578.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf66456ddd75edba44ef7865bb3205e","title":"kanye west ye review good music","story":"(GOOD Music  Def Jam)The world’s most talked-about rapper is bracingly honest about his mental health struggles – though his attitude towards women still needs workIt seems a strange thing to say about an album premiered at a globally live-streamed exclusive playback that involved flying journalists and “influencers” to the mountain ranges of Wyoming – an event with its own merchandise range, including a long-sleeved T-shirt that retails for $145 – but there is something curiously low-key about Kanye West’s new album. At least by Kanye West’s standards.It is neither a bold stylistic statement in the vein of 808s and Heartbreak (from 2008) or Yeezus (2013), nor a sprawling address along the lines of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy or ye’s immediate predecessor, The Life of Pablo. Its seven tracks – none of them an obvious hit single – clock in at a trim 23 minutes. Its cover was apparently snapped by West on his phone en route to the launch. Neither of the curious, attention-grabbing singles that preceded it are included, though the lyrical concerns of Ye vs the People are peppered throughout – you hear quite a lot about how no one fully understands the genius-level thought processes that led West to come out in favour of Donald Trump, which to hear him tell it was an act of nonpareil selflessness in the service of humanity.And despite the absence of the gibberish-strewn Lift Yourself, that track’s wilfully rough quality clings to sections of the album, not least the astonishing Ghost Town, which you would describe as having an epic, valedictory tone were it not for the fact that it feels like it’s falling apart before your very ears. An air-punch-inducing riff crashes around, played by a band that sound barely capable of holding themselves upright. Both West’s and Kid Cudi’s singing is off-key, and a guest appearance from John Legend sounds more like a placeholder guide vocal than a finished product. His voice cracks and strains, he slurs and mumbles, and occasionally sounds either like he’s forgotten the lyrics or was never given any in the first place. The overall effect is simultaneously stirring and unsettling, compounded by the lyrical references to self-harming and opiate addiction.You might hesitate to say that Ghost Town sounds like the work of a mind in the process of unravelling – the ongoing speculation about the state of West’s mental health is lurid and unsavoury – were it not for the fact that West himself spends large chunks of ye telling you that his mind is unravelling. It’s hard to think of another major rap album that exposes and dwells upon its star’s struggles with mental illness to this extent. West angrily brushes away other people’s concerns and offers of support, but then discusses his despairing thoughts of suicide and depressive “bad days” in starkly affecting terms: “Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb”. Then he brags about it, which feels like a very Kanye response to being diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder: “That’s my bipolar shit … that’s my superpower … I’m a superhero! I’m a superhero!”It’s not the only reason why West emerges from ye a more relatable, sympathetic, even likeable figure than he has on previous albums. There is something winning about how his defence of his positions on Trump and slavery is undercut by his sheepish admission that they led to what sounds like a pretty nuclear-powered bollocking from his wife. Still, there is plenty of the usual hip-hop fare on offer in the lyrics. The ongoing feud between the denizens of West’s GOOD Music label and Drake’s OVO organisation is stoked further on the trash-talking Make No Mistake, replete with West mocking Drake’s skin tone. And his attitude to women could still use some work: “You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?” he asks at one point, as if women are possessions one can modify like cars.From the start, West has traded in his own contradictions, not least admonishing consumerism while bragging about his rapacious spending, but he has never done it as provocatively as on the closing Violent Crimes, a track in which he admits to his as-a-father-of-daughters revelation that women are people too. He writhes in agony at the thought of North West (currently age four) reaching puberty, and his horror is compounded by the idea that she might inherit her mother’s figure. “Father forgive me, I’m scared of the karma,” he yelps, presumably looking back at those visits to the titty shop with a rueful eye. His paternal anguish is set to a lovely piano figure and a sweet chorus, courtesy of Dej Loaf.There are plenty of imbalanced moments. The scampering, falsetto vocals on All Mine quickly grate, and while there is something audacious about the way I Thought About Killing You suddenly turns into a completely different track three-quarters of the way through, neither of its two contrasting parts are anything to write home about. Still, they’re levelled out by stuff that is thrilling, such as the crashing drums and slick 70s soul vocal of No Mistakes and Wouldn’t Leave’s scattered, sparse eeriness. For all its brevity, ye doesn’t feel slight. Substantially more focused than its predecessor, it packs a lot into 23 minutes. It is bold, risky, infuriating, compelling and a little exhausting: a vivid reflection of its author."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a5e158927f04afe0da00f4f7f0311cfd743dfc/57_376_2211_1327/master/2211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78a34ab3ff2070f057d11dfca6a381ad","title":"roadmap to avoid brexit to be sent to mps and peers","story":"George Soros-backed Best for Britain pushes for second referendum on Theresa May’s deal with EU MPs and peers will be sent a roadmap next week detailing how they could stop Brexit by the George Soros-backed Best for Britain group, which has amassed £2.3m in donations to spend on a nationwide lobbying effort to persuade parliament to change its mind.The group will publish a timetable as part of its “campaign manifesto” at a launch event on 8 June saying that MPs need to introduce amendments calling for a second referendum on the final deal secured by Theresa May in which remaining in the European Union is an option on the ballot paper.Best for Britain says it is theoretically possible for a referendum to be held within 17 working days of parliament legislating for one, meaning it could be held in December. But the pressure group says the EU would allow the UK to have a second referendum as late as February or March.Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said a second referendum was necessary to ultimately settle the question of whether the UK should leave the EU: “We think people should have a chance to compare the deal we can get to the one we already have. What’s clear is we can’t have ‘a best of all worlds’ illusory Brexit as the debate about the Irish border shows.”To have any chance of success, Best for Britain would have to win over Labour’s front bench, plus more than 10 Tory rebels and shore up the support of sceptical backbench Labour MPs in constituencies that voted for leave in the 2016 referendum.The pressure group is stepping up its efforts to lobby 50 MPs by trying to generate pressure on them in their constituencies. It intends to take out advertisements in regional and local papers, starting on Saturday in the Scotsman, and buy up billboards in the target constituencies “as near to MPs’ offices as possible”. Campaign adverts, which have already appeared in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool as well as in some national newspapers, are headlined “When will we know what we voted for?” and add: “We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal”.Best for Britain said it would spend £500,000 of its £2.3m in donations on the newspaper and outdoor advertising campaign. The largest donor has been Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which has provided £800,000. He will not be attending next week’s launch event, but the 87-year-old financier and philanthropist gave a speech in Paris on Tuesday in which he trailed the launch, saying that Brexit was “an immensely damaging process”. He added: “Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better, however, if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.”Labour MPs in targeted leave-supporting areas include Caroline Flint, the Don Valley MP. She supported remain in 2016 but wrote last month that the UK should respect the referendum result and that parliament should stop “game playing” and reject proposals for a second national vote. Others in the campaign group’s focus include Ian Austin in Dudley North and the newly elected Gareth Snell in Stoke-on-Trent Central.Conservative MPs being targeted include John Stevenson, who holds the seat of Carlisle with a majority of 2,599 from Labour. Best for Britain says that future investment by multinational tyre maker Pirelli at a plant in the city remains at risk, unless the UK can at least remain part of a customs union with the EU.The pressure group believes the majority of the British public are turned off by the Brexit debate and will only seriously re-engage once the prime minister has concluded her orce negotiations with the EU. It is trying to train local organisers to organise street stalls or petitions with a target of having 20,000 conversations with members of the public in the 50 target seats.The involvement of Soros in the campaign has been attacked by rightwing newspapers, with the Daily Mail describing the Hungarian-American as a “foreign billionaire” engaged in a “plot to subvert Brexit”. Best for Britain uses that coverage as part of its fundraising campaigns, encouraging people to donate and “help us take on the Daily Mail” on a gofundme page that has raised £56,000 in the past week.Todd said: “The will of the people can be subverted by the will of the people in a second referendum. People can take a new decision based on new information.”The campaign group is not covered by Electoral Commission regulations, which ban foreign donors, because there is no pending national vote. However, a spokesman said the group did not take money from overseas and that Soros’s donations come via the Open Society Foundation’s UK branch, which is a company registered in England and Wales, which would mean they were permissible under election law.The campaign group hopes that several dozen MPs will attend the launch event, although does not intend to use any of its existing supporters as principal speakers. Labour MPs such as David Lammy and Jo Stevens have acted as spokespeople before, as well as Green party MP Caroline Lucas and Conservative Dominic Grieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cf84d3dbba21352937cb467ae5cb0745137946e/0_27_1626_976/master/1626.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e512f4d51d09a16858910b66c52c71bc","title":"england seamers pakistan sarfraz ahmed wins toss","story":"The International Cricket Council is contemplating the virtues of getting rid of the toss in Test cricket. Well, there are two captains, Joe Root and Sarfraz Ahmed, who might welcome being spared the agony of deciding what to do every time they win the toss. They are also becoming unwitting advocates of abandoning this idea.At Lord’s last week Root, despite a surprisingly green tinge to the playing surface, batted and England subsided to 184 all out on the first day. Here Sarfraz did the obvious thing. The pitch was dry and brown the sun was trying to creep through hazy cloud, a task it rarely fulfilled Pakistan batted and were bowled out for 174 and that total was bolstered by a late rally led by the irrepressible Shadab Khan. By the close England sat contentedly at 106 for two. Once again losing the toss had proved to be a wonderful bonus.This was not the Headingley of old when batsmen were constantly tormented by low movement off a treacherous track but the ball swung all day, often late in its flightpath and there was enough pace and bounce there for the majority of the nicks to carry. Batting was a trial whenever the bowlers’ radar was working.The Pakistan wickets were shared by a quartet of seamers, which included Sam Curran, who was given his first Test cap by Graham Thorpe at 10.15am after it was established that Ben Stokes was not fit to play. Curran’s first Test wicket was donated to him five hours later when Shadab, stranded with the last man, swung vigorously only to be caught at deep midwicket by Keaton Jennings. When Curran relates this landmark to his grandchildren (a long time from now – he’s only 19) he might point out that Jennings was England’s regular forward short-leg in this match and that his victim succumbed in the old leg trap. That may be enough detail in any case it does not matter how you get that first one.The other pacemen took three wickets apiece, which constituted a satisfactory return for Chris Woakes, who was preferred to Mark Wood, partly because, in the absence of Stokes, England were required to rejig the batting line-up.Stuart Broad, no doubt pricked by the observations of the odd former colleague in the media, was the first to get the ball swinging. In his first over Imam-ul-Haq was given lbw by Rod Tucker, only to review successfully with the ball shown to be going over the stumps. No matter Imam swung wantonly at the last ball of Broad’s over and Root held a neat catch at third slip.It was already apparent that the ball was swinging though in his first spell Jimmy Anderson was not able to exploit this as clinically as usual. Broad remained determined to bowl full while there was movement and he was rewarded with the wicket of Azhar Ali with an lbw that the batsman immediately recognised could not be reviewed.Woakes had not bowled with a red ball since the Melbourne Test – he was using a pink one in Auckland, after which he was dropped – and he bowled a horrible first over a wide long-hop was followed by a long half-volley and eight runs to the total.But he settled well after that, comforted by the fact that the ball was moving more for England here than it did at Lord’s. Soon Woakes had the key wickets of Haris Sohail and Asad Shafiq, both caught in a slip cordon that functioned better than in the first Test, though there was one inexpensive drop by Dawid Malan, the new second slip, who had been hampered by the sight of Root ing towards him.At lunch Pakistan had sunk to 68 for four and within another half an hour they were 79 for seven as the old firm set to work. Anderson was now on target and he removed Ahmed and Faheem Ashraf, while Broad ensured that Usman Salahuddin’s first day as a Test cricketer would end in disappointment he was lbw for four.Mohammad Amir opted for valour rather than discretion and was caught behind off Anderson for 13 prompting the Yorkshire crowd to start chanting “Oh Jimmy, Jimmy …” as if he was one of their own.Now Pakistan rallied through Shadab and a belligerent Hasan Ali, who added 43 together. Occasionally, Woakes’s rustiness was evident. As ever a bad ball at Headingley stood up and begged to be hit but a sharp caught and bowled brought the end of Hasan, not long before Curran celebrated his first wicket. By now the sun had obligingly resurfaced, which meant that batting was easier when Alastair Cook and Jennings began England’s reply.Jennings was positive in attack and defence. His ploy of standing almost a foot out of his crease when facing Mohammad Abbas was well conceived and executed there was even one disdainful cover drive hit with such certainty that he could stand and admire the ball speeding to the boundary. Cook also hinted at fluency with his feet moving nimbly and they posted an opening partnership of 53, which equalled the highest for England since the start of the Ashes tour.Jennings looked to be relishing his return but his departure was limp. He prodded forward to Ashraf and in the last millisecond before playing the ball he may have decided to leave it. The ball feathered his outside edge and a golden opportunity had passed.The same applied to his partner an hour later.

Thanks for your company – we’ll be back tomorrow morning to see if England can ram home their advantage.“I know within myself that I’m bowling well. I felt in good rhythm from ball one today. I looked to swing it away from the left-handers and wobble it to the right-handers because that brings LBW into play. What we did well as a unit was that we backed up each other from both ends we created a longevity of pressure.” Here’s Ali Martin on how Stuart Broad set the standard at Headingley today.37th over: England 106-2 (Root 29, Bess 0) Hasan Ali bowls the last over of the day. Root gets a single off the first ball and Bess blocks the remainder to complete a fine day for England. They trail by 68 runs with eight first-innings wickets remaining.36th over: England 105-2 (Root 28, Bess 0) Shadab shrieks an LBW appeal when Bess gets in a mess trying to defend a googly. It hit him in his personal space, but the umpire decided it was slipping past the leg stump. Replays confirm it was a good decision. It wouldn’t have been leg before wicket so much as le- well, you can do the rest.35th over: England 104-2 (Root 26, Bess 0) Whether you call it a golden arm, force of personality or sheer filthy effing luck, Hasan Ali has it. I’m not sure any other bowler on either side would have taken a wicket with that delivery at that time. That said, Cook will be so annoyed to get out like that. The new batsman is the nightwatchman Dom Bess. Hasan Ali, the man who makes things happen, returns for a two-over burst before the close – and he sends Cook for an early ice bath! It was a poor delivery, a short ball on leg stump, but Cook gloved an attempted pull down the leg side to Sarfraz. 34th over: England 102-1 (Cook 45, Root 26) Shadab goes around the wicket to Cook, who muscles a single to leg to bring up the England hundred. They have a great chance to bat Pakistan out of the game over the weekend. What a difference a day makes. What a difference a lost toss makes.33rd over: England 99-1 (Cook 44, Root 24) The forecast is mixed for tomorrow. Doesn’t really matter: England have all the time in the world and will have to work extremely hard to make a balls of this. They’ve had a really good day, though after recent events I doubt they will be adding up poultry.“Does Ian Botham drink cocktails?” says Jeremy Yapp. “If he did, would it be a Beefy-fty-two? ‘Jokes’ like that are why I became a father.”You met someone who likes jokes like that? Good work.32nd over: England 96-1 (Cook 40, Root 24) Shadab Khan comes on to bowl the first over of spin today. There’s some turn off the pitch, albeit slow, in an accurate first over. Well bowled.31st over: England 95-1 (Cook 40, Root 24) Pakistan enquire about a catch down the leg side when Cook flicks at Amir. He can be susceptible to that type of dismissal but this one hit the pad, the whole pad and nothing but the pad. “As the Pakistani pace bowlers struggle for a breakthrough,” says Angus Bujalski, “perhaps time for a Rawalpindi Express-o Martini?”30th over: England 92-1 (Cook 37, Root 24) Root plays the ball back to Abbas, who flings it towards the stumps as a way of telling Root to get back in his box. Root smiles and then clips the next ball through midwicket for four. Root looks more fluent in this innings than for many a month. It’s almost like he’s playing at home. “Surely a ‘Whispering Death’ is a cricketing cocktail waiting to be made?” says Matt Brown. “No idea what would be in it but I’m guessing something smooth, velvety, moreish and ludicrously potent.”And guaranteed to make you grovel.29th over: England 87-1 (Cook 36, Root 20) For a captain who doesn’t like having a third man, Root certainly knows how to score there – he gets his third boundary behind square on the off side with a deliberate steer off Amir. A Sky graphic shows that 26 per cent of his runs against seam in Tests in England have gone to third man. I love the smell of data in the evening.“Stephen Davenport’s literary segue to Kurt Vonnegut puts one in mind of Slaughterhouse Five,” says Brian Withington. “A potentially brutal cocktail (?) but also perhaps an apt description of England’s upper order last winter.”That’s also the name of Quentin Tarantino’s upcoming film about the Kent pace attack of the early 1990s: Duncan Spencer, Martin McCague, Dean Headley, Alan Igglesden and Dr Julian Thompson.28th over: England 81-1 (Cook 36, Root 14) Mohammad Abbas has had quite a start to his Test career: eight matches, 40 wickets at 17. He almost gets his 41st when Cook gets a late inside edge to fine leg for four had he not done so there would have been a huge LBW appeal.27th over: England 77-1 (Cook 32, Root 14) Everything feels so much more secure when Cook is playing well. The stats support that perception: he averages high 50s when England win or draw and 29 when they lose. Meanwhile, Amir angles a majestic, double-bluff legcutter past Root’s outside edge. He’ll never be as exhilarating as he was in 2010 but it’ll always be a joy to watch such an artist at work. 26th over: England 76-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Root, on the walk, is beaten by Abbas. Cricket doesn’t yet have Expected Score data – let’s keep it that way, pleasedammit - but this could easily be 65 for three. The ball has gone past the outside edge a helluva lot for a score of 76 for one.25th over: England 76-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Mohammad Amir returns to the attack. Pakistan will probably want two more wickets tonight, with a view to restricting England to a lead of around 100. Root survives an LBW enquiry from an inswinger that pitched outside leg nothing much else to report.“So cricket-based cocktail puns, is it?” hics Fran Mason. “How about Daiquiri Underwood, AEJ Tom Collins, Chris Old Fashioned, Peter Martini and someone whose surname is already a cricket-based cocktail pun, Otis Gibson.”24th over: England 75-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Oofah! Cook leaves a ball from Abbas that just bounces over the off stump. That was not without risk, but ultimately it was well judged. Ish. Cook is beaten later in the over, driving outside the line of a full-length wobbler. Pakistan have bowled really well in this session – it would have been so easy to go hunting for wickets but they have bowled with a lot of discipline and accuracy.23rd over: England 75-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Cook plays a lovely extra cover drive for four off Faheem. He looks in excellent touch at the moment, particularly with his driving.“Good either morning or afternoon, Rob,” says Stephen Davenport. “I have neither the wit nor the depth of bar-fly experience with which to invent a cricketing cocktail but as an homage to a certain ruddy-faced former Kent and England opener I drink at one of Kurt Vonnegut’s supposed hangouts in Indianapolis, the Red Key.” 22nd over: England 70-1 (Cook 26, Root 14) Mohammad Abbas, the subtle interrogator of this attack, replaces Hasan Ali. Root waves a shortish ball through backward point for four. Like Jennings, Root is batting outside his crease to negate the late movement of Abbas. England have been doing thought!“Re: the 15th over,” begins Matt Dony. “If someone told me that an activity involved ‘a yoga mat, a small plastic bat, gaffer tape, and some vigorous thrusting’, I don’t think my first guess would be ‘a demonstration of cricket umpiring.”Ha. It sounds like a scene from Oz, probably involving a displeased Adebisi.21st over: England 65-1 (Cook 25, Root 10) “As he has suffered from being rather all or nothing with his scoring recently, am I correct in suggesting that a score of 43 for Cook is by far the most desirable outcome of his current innings?” asks Tom Bowtell.Didn’t he have a couple of scores from 31-49 during the Ashes? I’d go for a nice solid 92. From memory I don’t think he’s been out in the nineties since he was bowled at Lord’s by Mitchell Marsh at 3.31pm on Saturday 18 July 2015.20th over: England 64-1 (Cook 24, Root 10) Four more to Root, guided through backward point off Hasan Ali.  19th over: England 57-1 (Cook 23, Root 4) Root gets off the mark with a confident stroke, clipping Faheem between mid-on and midwicket for four. England have another 75 minutes to survive until the close. 18th over: England 53-1 (Cook 23, Root 0) Hasan beats Cook with another ridiculously good delivery. Another maiden, which means the last four overs have produced three maidens, two runs and one wicket. 17th over: England 53-1 (Cook 23, Root 0) Joe Root is the new batsman.Keaton Jennings falls for a useful 29. Faheem Ashraf angled a length delivery across him from over the wicket, and Jennings snicked a defensive push through to Sarfraz. He might feel he could have left that, but overall it was a decent return to the side.16th over: England 51-0 (Cook 23, Jennings 27) Hasan Ali, back over the wicket, beats Cook with a brilliant legcutter at the start of a fine maiden over. I must say, I love watching Hasan bowl he’s Pakistan cricket personified. If he was 7-8mph quicker he’d be a world beater.15th over: England 51-0 (Cook 23, Jennings 27) Jennings survives an optimistic LBW appeal after leaving Faheem on length. It looked dodgy at first but it was a good leave. Of course it was a good leave: it was a Keaton Jennings leave.Here’s Mark Higgins. “Nasser was showing he needs to keep up to date with the latest MCC laws (15:57). Law 41.15.1, which became effective on 1 October 2017, states that “The striker shall not adopt a stance in the protected area or so close to it that frequent encroachment is inevitable.” That’s what the umpires were picking up on with Jennings. One of our club umpires recently ran a session where he explained and demonstrated various new laws. I recall that the demonstration of law 41.15.1 involved a yoga mat, a small plastic bat, gaffer tape, and some vigorous thrusting. Happy Days!”Oof, that’s a good spot – thanks. Still not sure I agree with the law, mind you.14th over: England 51-0 (Cook 23, Jennings 27) Hasan Ali goes around the wicket to beat Cook with a gorgeous full-length delivery that zips away off the seam. He bowls some serious jaffas – but he also bowls a few four-balls, and Cook drives the next delivery through extra cover for four to bring up the fifty partnership. While I’ve been pencilling Keaton Jennings in for 20,000 Test runs, Cook has been playing beautifully. As at Lord’s, his driving has been terrific.“Afternoon Rob,” chirps Phil Sawyer. “Cricket cocktails? A Sex on the Leach, and of course a Mai Mum Could Have Hit That With A Stick Of Rhubarb Tai.”13th over: England 47-0 (Cook 19, Jennings 27) Jennings looks so relaxed between deliveries. It’s only a small thing, buT I’VE SAID HE’LL MAKE IT AT TEST LEVEL I’M GOING TO INVENT AS MUCH EVIDENCE AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS, OKAY? Faheem jags a fine delivery back into Jennings, who plays a beautiful Chinese cut just wide of leg stump for four. Superb technique. Faheem, who is a better bowler than he looks, then beats Jennings outside off with consecutive deliveries. Terrific over.“Fairbrothers’ Ruin,” says Ant Pease. “I believe it’s also a component of a Llong Island Iced Tea.”12th over: England 43-0 (Cook 19, Jennings 23) A dangerous inswinger from Hasan Ali is defended solidly by Cook, who back cuts the next delivery for four. Hasan has been a bit impatient so far I suppose that’s human nature given the match situation.“‎Afternoon, Smyth,” says Sean Clayton. “A World Cup month during England participation is no time to give up anything (5th over).‎ I timed giving up cigs for the day after England went out of the 2002 World Cup as I knew I’d weaken during the inevitable penalty shoot-out\\extra-time\\90 minutes stress otherwise...”And to think Prince wanted to do a collaboration the day before you gave up.11th over: England 39-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 23) A double bowling change, with Faheem Ashraf replacing Po’ Mo’ Amir, who bowled much better than figures of 5-0-24-0 would suggest. Jennings survives a biggish LBW shout from a ball that seemed to clearly pitch outside leg. No review from Pakistan, and rightly so.“The way to test for swing potential at Headingley is to wave a ferret in the air before the toss,” says Kim Thonger. “If the ferret’s fur goes curly, like it’s had a perm, bowl. I’m told this works at all Northern cricket grounds.”And you say you’re off booze at the moment?10th over: England 39-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 23) Pakistan need something to happen, which means it’s time for Hasan Ali. He starts with an absurd jaffa that beats Jennings, who smiles in acknowledgement of his futility and then larrups a square cut for four later in the over. “The classic Wallbanger would use vodka rather than gin,” says Adrian Armstrong, “but I’m sure Fairbrothers’ Ruin would work. As long as it also contains the essential ingredient, Jason Galliano.”9th over: England 32-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 17) Amir drifts onto the pads of Cook, who puts him through midwicket for four. These are good signs for England, both in the judgement of Cook and Jennings and the relative lack of movement for the Pakistan bowlers. Mind you, a good start against Pakistan at Headingley is never much of a guarantee. In 1992, England were 270 for one – and then 320 all out.“Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Regarding Kim Thonger’s Drune™️ (Dry June) conundrum I think all will be well if England can make it to July (!) at which point Kim will be able to give it some Wely™️ as needed.”8th over: England 28-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 17) Abbas moves around the wicket to Jennings, who gets another inside edge onto the pad. The pitch looks pretty flat, with little seam movement for either bowler, and that knowledge gives Jennings the confidence to chase a wide one and lash it through extra cover for four. Good shot. I may look like a moron if somebody dredges this up in 2027, but I do think Jennings has got something about him.“Rob,” says John Starbuck. “It’s not that hard to judge if the ball will swing at Headingley. Just look at the sky. Granted, you do need a long history of doing it to get this right.”I always thought there was no rhyme or reason to when it swings at Headingley – eg 1989, gloomy and overcast, Australia 601 for seven declared. And don’t get me started on poor old Mike Smith.7th over: England 24-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 13) Jennings fences the unlucky Amir just short of the man at gully. It’s an interesting battle of patience, this. Pakistan are trying to force the issue without forcing the issue. So far I think they’ve bowled really well.“I seem to remember getting an hilarious OBO years ago about a cricket-themed beer called IPA Richards,” says Ant Pease. “With reference to Guy Hornsby’s impending insobriety, can we crowdfund an OBO gin called Fairbrothers’ Ruin?”That’s the one you put in a Neil Harvey Wallbanger, right? 6th over: England 23-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 12) Discipline was the defining feature of Pakistan’s victory at Lord’s. It’ll be interesting to see how patient they are with the ball if England don’t lose early wickets. Amir and Abbas have started well, whatever the scoreboard might suggest, and Abbas’s third over is an accurate maiden to Cook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755f9fcfbe85a04556df5aff220846db8beb7052/938_1063_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e3004ba15dbcd43ac1aeb0fdf3f6c49","title":"stuart laws funniest things","story":"The standup comic on the things that make him laugh the mostHarry Hill’s 2005 tour preview at a 100-seater venue in Windsor.

It also proved problematic in ways that hinted at Facebook’s later problems with fake news, political balance and the limitations of AI in managing the human world.When Facebook launched “trending” in 2014 as a list of headlines appearing at the side of the main news feed, it aimed to steal users from Twitter by offering them a quick look at the most popular news stories.It aligned with the pledge just a year earlier by Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to make Facebook a “personal newspaper” for users. But at that time fake news was not a popular term and no foreign country had been accused of trying to influence the US elections through social media, as Russia would be.Trending news that year included the death of Robin Williams, Ebola and the World Cup.Facebook is testing new features, including a breaking news label that publishers can add to stories to distinguish them. Facebook also wants to make local news more prominent.Facebook’s head of news products, Alex Hardiman, said the company is still committed to real-time news. But instead of letting Facebook’s moderators make editorial decisions, there has been a subtle shift to let news organisations do so.Problems with the trending section emerged in 2016, when the company was accused of bias against conservatives, based on comments by an anonymous former contractor.The contractor claimed Facebook downplayed conservative issues and promoted liberal causes.Zuckerberg met prominent rightwing leaders at the company’s headquarters in an attempt at damage control. Yet two years later, Facebook still has not been able to shake the notion of bias.In late 2016, Facebook fired the human editors who worked on trending topics and replaced them with software that was supposed to be free of political bias.Instead, the software algorithm began to pick out posts that were getting the most attention, even if the information was bogus.In early 2017, Facebook made another attempt to fix the trending section by including only topics covered by several news publishers. The idea was that coverage by just one outlet could be a sign that the news is fake.The problems underscore the difficulty of relying on computers, or even AI, to make sense of the messy human world without committing obvious, sometimes embarrassing and occasionally disastrous errors.Facebook appears to have concluded that trying to fix the headaches caused by the trending section was not worth the meagre benefits the company, users and news publishers saw in it.“There are other ways for us to better invest our resources,” Hardiman said.The breaking news label that Facebook is testing with 80 news publishers will let outlets such as the Washington Post add a red label to indicate that a story is breaking news.“Breaking news has to look different than a recipe,” Hardiman said.Another feature, called Today In shows people breaking news in their area from local publishers, officials and organisations. It’s being tested in 30 markets in the US.Hardiman said the goal is to help “elevate great local journalism”.The company is also funding news videos, created exclusively for Facebook by publishers it would not yet name. It plans to launch this feature in the next few months.While Facebook got attention for the problems the trending section had – perhaps because it seemed popular with journalists – neither its existence nor its removal makes much difference in regards to Facebook’s broader problems with news.Hardiman said that ending the trending feature feels like letting a child go but Facebook’s focus is prioritising trustworthy, informative news that people find useful.

For the third time in four years, Top Gear has found itself without its lead host. If you’re feeling optimistic, at least you can say that Matt LeBlanc resigned in a largely professional way.At least it was delivered through the proper channels, and sounded grateful. Given the way the last two Top Gear hosts ducked out – Chris Evans tweeted his resignation under a swirl of low ratings and digs from the tabloids, and Jeremy Clarkson effectively punched his way to a sacking – LeBlanc’s exit is a Debrett’s level masterclass in etiquette.In fairness to LeBlanc, his stay was never likely to be a long one. His appointment had the ring of novelty, like the BBC was overstretching to show that it still has muscle. Here was a legitimately famous man – admittedly most famous for a 20-year-old television programme, but still – who lives in America and spends six months of every year earning $4m a season on his CBS sitcom, Man With a Plan. Was he ever going to give that up in order to interview Jason Manford in an abandoned paint factory in Dunsfold? Would you? Of course you wouldn’t. But let’s not focus too hard on the exit. Let’s focus on the hole that has been left behind. Losing so many hosts in such a short time is not ideal. The appeal of Top Gear was that it always looked more fun to make than to watch. So if the people who make it can’t be bothered any more, then why should we?As far as I can tell, the BBC now has four options. The first is to replace LeBlanc with another celebrity. Maybe it can lure in Adam Sandler or Vin Diesel or Jay Leno with the promise of driving around the Alps in a supercar a few times a year. Maybe it will. But I’d argue that it shouldn’t. Big American stars are flighty and expensive, and they wouldn’t necessarily enjoy the grunt-work of putting together a weekly magazine show for BBC Two. Or maybe Top Gear could introduce a rotating panel of big-name guest hosts. But, again, I wouldn’t recommend this option. This is partly because star quality is never what the show has been about. Some of the filmed segments might enjoy a bit of razzle-dazzle, but it is always juxtaposed with the slapdash make-do-and-mend nature of the studio segments. The heart of Top Gear isn’t the car reviews, it’s the knowledge that the everyone on camera has just been drinking crap tea from a polystyrene cup while hiding from drizzle in a caravan. Sacrificing that for a succession of tentpole names would be a mistake. Also, Have I Got News For You has guests hosts, and Have I Got News For You is terrible.Alternatively, they could just let the existing hosts get on with it. Over the past couple of years, Chris Harris and Rory Reid have developed a nice little chemistry of their own, with Harris as the bone-deep car nerd and Reid as the excitable child. Perhaps they have what it takes to shoulder the series alone? After all, don’t forget that it took a few years for Clarkson, Hammond and May to properly bed in. The BBC has always been much better at developing talent than shipping it in, so it would make sense to just hand Top Gear to them to see what happens. Sure, it might not initially be the ratings smash of old, but the pair could take their time and build it back into something that fits their respective skillsets. The result of this would be a newer, better, more authentic Top Gear that might well regain some of the show’s former glory.Or they could just ditch it altogether. Top Gear has become a liability, so they could just bin it and move on. In fact, yes, let’s just go with that one. Great. Decision made. Thanks Top Gear. The door’s that way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9942f103d2d1713034a7b78ca27d3a79f7fa044/0_31_7398_4438/master/7398.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721317b7c231ef0208dde4e3fef8e675","title":"from black panthers to bbq becky the displacement of black oakland","story":"After police were called on a barbecue, black Oaklanders share stories of racism and evictionsKenzie Smith can’t get the voice out of his head. The woman could’ve ended his life with a single phone call, he said, and her threatening words play on repeat.The 37-year-old Oakland man made headlines last month when a white woman called police on him for barbecuing at Lake Merritt, a public park he has frequented since he was a child. Jennifer Schulte, who called 911 to complain about Smith’s use of a charcoal grill, was soon nicknamed BBQ Becky, becoming the subject of viral memes and the most recent symbol of white Americans harassing black people.“Every time I look at that spot, it’s a constant reminder. I’m always going to hear that voice,” Smith said on a recent sunny morning, standing in the grass where, weeks earlier, his leisurely Sunday had turned into a nightmare. “I honestly thought that I was going to die.” Smith’s story reignited a national debate about racism in America, but in Oakland, the episode triggered a more acute pain. For some, it was a powerful depiction of the rapid disappearance of black Oakland – a trend that for years has been dramatic in San Francisco, just across the bay.While African Americans in Oakland have been steadily displaced by gentrification, others who remain are treated like criminals in their own hometown. Oakland was a critical destination for African American families migrating from the south in the 1940s, a home to a “Harlem of the West” jazz and blues scene in the 1950s and the birthplace of the the Black Panther party in the 1960s.The government, however, systematically devastated the city’s black communities throughout the 20th century. Officials constructed freeways, train tracks and federal buildings that literally destroyed homes and tore neighborhoods apart. Federal “redlining” practices embedded racial inequality and segregation into the city’s development, with banks allowing wealthy white communities to flourish while denying home ownership to black families. A corrupt police agency brutalized and jailed innocent black citizens.“My question is, when does it stop?” said the Rev Thomas Harris III, the longtime pastor at Pleasant Grove Baptist church in West Oakland. While a typical service once brought 75 to 100 congregants, the numbers have dwindled to as little as 25 as black families have been pushed out of the area. Now, the biggest threat facing working class black families who survived decades of racist policies is the extreme housing crisis plaguing the region. Pressured by the nation’s priciest real estate in San Francisco and the neighboring Silicon Valley tech boom, Oakland has one of the fastest-rising rents in the US.“It’s ground zero in the United States right now for this kind of intensity of high housing costs and displacement,” said Malo Hutson, a Columbia University urban planning professor.If Josephine Hardy’s landlord successfully evicts her from her home of 47 years in July, she said her first stop would probably be a relative’s couch hours away. After that, she doesn’t know.Three generations of Hardy’s family are now being forced out of their home of five decades, a painful process that began after an engineer at Intel purchased the three-unit property they have long rented in West Oakland. The 69-year-old woman, who once worked for the public school system, lives in an upstairs apartment while her daughter and granddaughter share a unit downstairs. Hardy’s son was living in a third unit, until Itua Oiyemhonlan, the new landlord, moved him out, saying he would be moving in. “We are being pushed out of our community,” said Hardy, in tears, as she sat on her daughter’s couch, recounting how a group of working-class black women built up the neighborhood and lamenting that their families can no longer reap the benefits. “We are treated like we don’t really belong here. It seems like our communities are so dispensable.” Oiyemhonlan is also black and was born in Oakland. But Leah Simon-Weisberg, Hardy’s attorney, said the trend she had seen in recent years was wealthy younger landlords and large management companies buying rent-controlled properties with the goal of turning big profits by removing low-income families.In many of her cases, the lawyer said, “they are predatory. They understand they’ll be able to push people out.” Hardy said she had suffered from panic attacks since Oiyemhonlan bought her home and that she could not begin to think about moving her belongings, including heirlooms passed down from her great-grandmother, who was once a slave in Louisiana. “I thought I’d be here until I couldn’t climb those steps anymore.” Oiyemhonlan did not respond to an inquiry and his attorney declined to comment. Theo Williams is a native Oaklander and African American artist who has found a way to remain in the city, even after his family lost their home. But in recent years, at least one neighbor has been less than pleased with his presence.On 27 September 2015, Williams, who grew up by Lake Merritt in the 1980s, was part of a small drum circle with his group SambaFunk! Funkquarians when a white man who said he lived nearby showed up to the lake to try and stop them. The man said they were violating noise ordinances, but the group, which had been drumming there for several years and was outside for a rare lunar eclipse, kept playing. A confrontation ensued, and according to Williams, the man tried to grab his drumsticks.The man called police, and eventually a squad of officers showed up, leading Williams to get a citation for “battery” after the caller alleged he had been assaulted. Prosecutors ultimately decided not to file charges. “It was humiliating and disrespectful, but it was also a sense of disbelief that this was really happening, that this person would exercise this much privilege,” Williams said. “You don’t own me.” Over the years, Williams, who lives in a small artist studio, said he has long experienced racial profiling and police harassment in his hometown: “My personal history is: constantly getting detained, constantly getting asked questions … It actually becomes very traumatic.”But when white residents new to the community try and suppress black culture, residents said, it can be particularly hurtful. Not long after the drumming controversy, Pleasant Grove Baptist church began receiving noise complaints for loud music – and the city responded by threatening a $3,529 fine, plus penalties of $500 a day if the “noise” continued, saying the property was the “site of nuisance activity”. “It was disturbing. How can someone come into the community and begin to dictate to somebody who has been there for years?” said Harris. “We thought we enhanced the community, not bring it down.”Elder Ron Rosson, then an associate pastor, said the anonymous neighbors filing noise complaints were “bullying” and that it seemed “racially motivated”. He noted the historical significance of religious music for black communities, dating back to slavery: “It’s our communication. It’s our liberty. To be told not to do that and to not express yourself in that way … that is not who we are. That’s not how we do church.” The hostility toward black people in a gentrifying Oakland can extend beyond cultural institutions. When a Whole Foods store opened in an abandoned car dealership near Marlena Henderson’s home, her family was thrilled to have organic produce and began shopping there regularly, she said. That day, her 13-year-old son walked into the store by himself to purchase a Christmas gift for his mother. He had saved up and called his mother on the phone, who talked to him about possible gifts, like scarves or body products, she recalled. When he later returned home empty handed and “too upset to speak”, she knew something was wrong. The store’s security staff, according to Henderson, had accused her son of trying to steal, saying he looked “suspicious” shopping for women’s products and that they saw him enter a bathroom with his basket. They ultimately escorted him out of the building. She said a manager was later defensive, claiming her son frequently tried to steal and questioning how he could have the money to afford the potential gifts.“He was humiliated and traumatized, all for trying to be responsible, trying to be generous, trying to do something good and going to a place he knew I loved,” she said, adding, “It could’ve gotten to the point where somebody called police who then shot my son.” Whole Foods did not respond to a request for comment. Though they no longer shop there, the family lives nearby and cannot avoid the reminder, Henderson said: “It’s a memory for him that stings.” For some forced out of Oakland, there’s no turning back. “I was no longer willing to fight. It was too taxing for me,” said Karna Leggett, a 45-year-old lifelong Oaklander who recently moved to Texas after her father died. She said she wanted to stay in the home, which she had rented since 1999 and where her father had lived for 40 years. But negotiations with her landlord, who was trying to take control of the property, dragged on for more than a year. Eventually, she gave up.“They had made living there so distasteful to me that I just wanted to leave it all behind,” said Leggett.(Daniel Bornstein, an attorney for the landlord, said Leggett “voluntarily” left after reaching an “amicable settlement”.)Leggett doesn’t know how long she’ll stay in Texas, but one thing, she said, seemed clear: she’ll never be able to live in Oakland again. Some have found ways of resisting. In 2015, after the noise complaints against black musicians, residents organized a “Make a Joyful Noise” celebration, taking over a public street.And this month, hundreds showed up at Lake Merritt for a “BBQ’n While Black” event to protest the police call by Schulte, who could not be reached for comment. Kenzie Smith showed up to the lake on a recent morning to help clean up the section of the lake where many have been holding barbecues in solidarity with him: “I don’t want to give anyone any reason to complain,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoThe boys played a great style of rugby.

However, An Bord Pleanála later approved the plan following an appeal.Calerotech then sought permission in an application lodged on April 6th to extend the development to a six-storey apartment block consisting of 97 residential units in a Georgian and Classical architectural style, alongside 114 associated car parking spaces . The company said the development would “increase residential density on an under-utilised site”. However, the council has refused permission, ruling that “height, bulk and scale would represent an overdevelopment of this site, at an excessive density and in material contravention of the provisions of the Kilternan Glenamuck Local Area Plan 2013-2019”. Additionally, the council found the proposed development would have an adverse effect on the adjacent Enniskerry Road and interfere with the “character” of the surrounding landscape.It also said it would damage the amenities of local residents in close proximity to the development and potentially depreciate the value of their properties, provide insufficient residential amenities to occupants and fail to make sufficient provision for sustainable communities. Calerotech will appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála, according to company director Greg Kavanagh. Labour Cllr Lettie McCarthy said she was “delighted to see the council honouring the local area plan”. But Fine Gael Cllr John Kennedy described the plan as “conservative” and due for updating. “If housing targets in these areas are not going to be met as a consequence of more rejection, this effectively just serves to push the burden of meeting new housing targets on to the more heavily populated suburbs nearby,” he said. Chairwoman of Kilternan Glenamuck Residents Association Aileen Eglington was “relieved and comforted” by the council’s decision, saying that it “continues to have a vision” for the area.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Getty Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis is creating a Brexit plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the border that would be in effect for local traders, like dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, the newspaper said. The Department of Foreign Affairs offered no comment on the specific proposal in a statement released in response to the plan the UK’s Brexit secretary is reportedly creating. Instead it urged Britain to engage with the EU “in a more detailed way” on the parts of the draft Brexit treaty relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the “backstop” option that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and single market if no other solution was found to avoid a hard border.“At this stage in the process, the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop,” said a spokesman for the department.“The engagement must be through the formal negotiation with the Task Force, led by Michel Barnier. The Tánaiste and Irish officials are in ongoing contact with the EU Task Force team.”Mr Davis’s plan is a revision of the “max fac” or “maximum facilitation” plan, the report said, citing a source.British prime minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options.One would be “max fac” in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.The other option being considered is a “customs partnership”, according to which the UK would co-operate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border.The European Union previously criticised Ms May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Britain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce dismissed the idea of a 10-mile Border buffer zone being considered by the UK government as “unworkable.”“Moving the problem of the Border to 10 miles away won’t solve the problem,” said John McGrane, the director-general of the chamber. “All that will happen in a dual-territory model is added costs of complying with double regulations - and more costs means less jobs.”The chamber was “aghast” that, with the clock on negotiations “ticking down daily towards a potential hard Brexit,” that the UK government is still not saying clearly how it will deliver a borderless future for trade both northsouth and eastwest between the UK and Ireland, he said. - additional reporting - ReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515398.1527858986!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s great greyhound racing advocate faces brexit bind","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGone to the dogs: greyhound racing faces Brexit challengeThe Star Sports English Greyhound Derby at Towcester on Saturday will, despite its name, be a thoroughly Irish affair with Droopy’s Verve the 64 favourite taking on five other Irish dogs in greyhound racing’s premier annual fixture. Eighty-five per cent of the dogs running on British greyhound tracks every year are Irish, with British trainers typically sending bitches to Ireland for breeding.The free movement of dogs between the two islands has flourished since at least the late 1860s, when Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup three times to become the most celebrated dog in the world. Master McGrath was commemorated with a statue in Lurgan and a monument in his home town of Dungarvan, and inspired a ballad that framed his race against an English competitor in terms of British-Irish rivalry: As Rose and the Master they both ran along, ‘Now I wonder,’ says Rose, ‘what took you from your home You should have stayed there in your Irish domain, And not come to gain laurels on Albion’s plain.’ ‘Well, I know,’ says McGrath, ‘we have wild heather bogs But you’ll find in old Ireland there’s good men and dogs. Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw, Stuff that up your nostrils,’ says Master McGrath.Greyhound racing in Britain has been in decline since the 1950s, with the number of tracks falling from more than 100 to fewer than 30. Unlike horse racing, which benefits from a levy on betting, greyhound racing receives no subsidy from the bookmakers.Live hare coursing, the sport in which Master McGrath won his laurels, is banned in Britain, but accusations of cruelty continue to pursue dog racing, which has also been damaged by scandals around doping after dogs were given cocaine to run faster. At the English Greyhound Derby lunch in London this week, its chairman, Alexander Hesketh, identified animal welfare as the greatest challenge facing the sport.Hesketh, a hereditary peer whose seat in the House of Lords was abolished in 1999, owns Towcester race course and is on a mission to modernise greyhound racing in Britain and around the world. The owners of every dog that runs at his course must pay a fee of £200, which is matched by Towcester to create what he calls a “canine pension fund” to rehome greyhounds when their racing days are over. Greyhound races now publish injury statistics, which show that injuries and deaths are lower than in horse racing, and Hesketh will soon launch a “Towcester standard” guaranteeing high welfare standards for animals.Hesketh was chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives in 2011 to join Ukip and has been an enthusiastic advocate for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. One of his passions is now in conflict with another, however, as Brexit threatens to complicate the free movement of dogs between Ireland and Britain.Liam Dowling, who breeds greyhounds at Ballymac Kennels in\u0026nbspBallymacelligott, \u0026nbspCo Kerry, has already seen his business suffer from the 14 per cent depreciation in sterling since the Brexit vote two years ago.“Our kennels are only 10 minutes from Farranfore, Kerry Airport. In that sense we are 90 minutes from London. We’re closer to London than Dublin for many interested buyers. But since the depreciation in Sterling, a lot less buyers are flying in to consider buying a greyhound. After the recession in 2008, our family business thought we were past all of that but the prospect of Brexit means more uncertainty,” he said.Currently, dogs travelling to Britain require a pet passport, a rabies vaccination and a health check by a vet 48 hours prior to travel with a registered transporter.\u0026nbspThat process could become more complicated and time-consuming if Britain leaves the EU without a deal or if the greyhound industry is not protected in a future trade agreement. Gerard Dollard, chief executive of Bord na gCon, is anxious about the impact of Brexit on an industry that involves 12,000 people and generates €300 million in economic activity.“Brexit is a game-changer for the greyhound sector,” he said. “There are thousands of jobs across rural Ireland dependent on a vibrant industry. There are no alternative export markets. As the semi-State body responsible for the commercial development of the sector, engagement has been ongoing between Bord na gCon and the Department of Agriculture. Their officials recognise the economic and social risk that potentially arises from Brexit. Like other sectors we need in as far as possible a frictionless border.”"},{"url":null,"title":"valerie jarrett hopes for teaching moment from roseanne barr s tweet","story":"  May 29, 2018Roseanne

Today, some 1.1 billion people - 20 per cent of the population over the age of 15 - smoke.  Yet, although most countries have seen a fall in smoking rates, only a minority of countries look set to meet global and national commitments to cut tobacco use in over 15s by 30 per cent by 2025. The UK is one of a handful of countries on track to meet this goal.Which countries are on track to meet global tobacco reduction targets?The UK, where the first voluntary warnings appeared on cigarette packets in the 1970s and a smoking ban in public places has been in force since 2007, is one of a number of mostly wealthy countries that has led the way in tobacco control. Today just 16 per cent of the British population smokes, compared to 46 per cent in 1974.Across the rest of Europe smoking is also fast falling out of fashion. Last week, a new study revealed that smoking is starting to lose its allure in France as one million daily smokers kicked the habit in the last year thanks to the recent introduction of anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on cigarettes and plain packaging.Even Greece -  the European country where the biggest proportion of the population lights up - has seen a fall in smoking rates by almost two percentage points a year.Where are people stubbing out their cigarettes?The report reveals, however, that there are stark disparities between countries and regions. While 62 million smokers  in high-income countries stubbed out their cigarettes between 2000 and 2015, the number of smokers in low and middle income countries actually increased by 33 million.Less wealthy countries will see an increase in smokersThe report said that efforts to reduce tobacco use in low and middle income countries has likely been impeded by the tobacco industry whose relentless lobbying has stopped governments from introducing stronger policies.Dr Vinayak Prasad, co-lead author of the report and programme manager of  WHO\u0027s Tobacco Control, Prevention of Non Communicable Diseases team said: “It’s easier to get the political will and to explain the problem of tobacco but the tobacco industry is taking strong measures - they use all kinds of arguments such as the argument that controlling tobacco harms people\u0027s livelihoods.  The data however, disproves that controlling tobacco affects livelihoods.”The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region - which covers much of the Middle East and North Africa - is one region where overall smoking rates have barely fallen. The actual number of people smoking is expected to rise from 47 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2025 - a more than two-fold increase.Smoking rate are falling in most of the world- except the Middle East and AfricaDr Prasad said that multiple reasons lie behind high smoking rates in the region. “It’s culturally and socially acceptable to use the water pipe in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, there’s been no strong leadership to push tobacco reduction at the highest level and countries have been hesitant to tax,” he said.Some GCC countries such as the UAE which introduced a \u0027sin tax\u0027 on cigarettes last October are starting to take measures but these have so far not been sufficient, according to Dr. Prasad.Some countries are bucking global trends as more people light upWhile the picture in many low and middle income countries is less sanguine, one group that is bucking the trend is women.Globally, women are kicking the habit faster in all regions of the world except Europe. “European women are an outlier globally,” said Dr Prasad. He said that factors including more liberal gender attitudes are contributing to a slower fall in smoking among women.Every year tobacco kills seven million people around the world – more than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are key causes of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year - with smoking responsible for some three million of these deaths.“The single biggest killer in the world is cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Prasad. “They are responsible for almost 44 percent of non-communicable disease deaths. If you fix the heart problem, you fix a big proportion of NCDs,” he said. According to the WHO few people are aware of the link between heart disease and tobacco as there is evidence of a serious lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.“Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.In recent years, more countries have adopted tobacco control policies such as plain packaging, taxation and banning smoking in public places.More people are now covered by tobacco control measuresAlthough Dr Prasad acknowledges that the tobacco industry and the continual development of novel products to continue to lure smokers remains an obstacle, he said that tobacco control policies have had a marked impact in many countries - including in low and middle income countries.“Taxation for sure is definitely an instrument - the additional revenue has been used to help the government fund universal health care in places like the Philippines,” said Dr Prasad. “Smoke free policies also cost very little as do warning labels and plain packaging,” he added.   Although the WHO’s current projection shows few countries will meet the 30 per cent target, Dr Prasad pointed to the example of France as evidence of what a country can achieve with political will. “France wasn’t doing anything until 2016 then woke up and introduced plain packaging. Things change.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyNiall Ferguson leaves Stanford role after ordering \u0026#39opposition research\u0026#39 on a student in free speech rowComment: Parents who barely know how to be parents are raising kids who can barely functionRare Iberian lynx spotted in Barcelona for first time in a century after crossing from Portugal We should applaud the end of the nuclear family, says top judgePublic vote to find \u0026#39modern day Wilfred Owen\u0026#39Donald Trump confirms North Korea summit with Kim Jong-un is back on for June 12India\u0026#39s Prime Minister rebukes China whilst holding out \u0026#39olive branch\u0026#39  Brexit bulletin: Save Penka the pregnant cow from heartless EU officialsDonald Trump ‘considering a dozen more pardons’ despite criticism that picks are politically motivatedPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaWhat England fans travelling to Russia need to be concerned aboutGiant panda found roaming streets of China\u0026#39s Sichuan ProvinceLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVSurrey sex dungeon couple must pay £45,000 after court hears they ignored order to shut downItaly\u0026#39s new populist coalition sworn in as deputy PM says expelling migrants is a priorityRoman merchant who was beheaded by flying rock while fleeing Pompeii had \u0026#39treasure trove\u0026#39 of silver coinsToday editor forced to defend gender pay gap as Martha Kearney reveals she is not paid as much as John Humphrys Democrats 2020: Could Julián Castro become America\u0026#39s first Hiic president?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"british royal expert exposed tommy new york","story":"Those watching the royal wedding on foreign channels may not have been surprised to see a \u0027royal expert\u0027 with a plummy voice and a triple-barreled name explaining the festivities to viewers.However, a man who calls himself Thomas J Mace-Archer-Mills Esq was reportedly not all he seemed.Mr Mace-Archer-Mills has built himself a relatively large media platform over the past few years, touting himself as an expert on the British royals, speaking in an English accent - but, according to US media reports, he is a New Yorker named Thomas “Tommy” Muscatello.Mr Muscatello appeared on multiple foreign networks over the weekend, wearing tweed and a bow tie, pronouncing his opinions on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Producers seemingly thought they were commissioning a bona fide upper-crust British man.His website lists scores of broadcasters who have enlisted his views on royal matters including many BBC radio stations, as well as many from around the globe.He told a US channel from a five-star hotel that the Duchess of Sussex should not upstage existing members of the royal family “especially when you’re coming in the way you are”.The royal enthusiast also told a Norwegian broadcaster that the marriage should be about keeping integrity, keeping formality and making sure that the traditions and heritage that we have as British people remain at the forefront.He said of Ms Markle in a video recorded outside Buckingham Palace: “She is loud, she is American, she fights for her cause. We don’t do that here.“We do things quietly with dignity.“Ms Markle is going to be a little bit challenged when it comes to that because she’s so used to doing things the American way, which is not the British way.”The royal expert was so widely-interviewed that one piece described him as the most interviewed man on the subject of the royal wedding. He retweeted this message to his followers.The Wall Street Journal reported the alleged true background of the 38-year-old Italian-American, who told the newspaper that he identifies more as British than American, and that he had been obsessed with the UK as a child.He said he made his surname using the “names of friends and distant relations” and that he has an agreement with two unrelated elderly British people who let him call them his grandparents.However, he later responded to the claims in the WSJ, saying: The Wall Street Journal breached journalistic trust, omitted truths and mis-sold what the initial interview was for, he said.Many of the facts in the article are inaccurate and the Wall Street Journal itself was given many opportunities to ensure that the article was published with the most accurate information available. The WSJ chose not to adhere to the facts or their integrity.The  has contacted Mr Muscatello for comment.The WSJ said in a statement: We stand by our reporting.Please review our commenting policyNiall Ferguson leaves Stanford role after ordering \u0026#39opposition research\u0026#39 on a student in free speech rowComment: Parents who barely know how to be parents are raising kids who can barely functionRare Iberian lynx spotted in Barcelona for first time in a century after crossing from Portugal We should applaud the end of the nuclear family, says top judgePublic vote to find \u0026#39modern day Wilfred Owen\u0026#39Donald Trump confirms North Korea summit with Kim Jong-un is back on for June 12India\u0026#39s Prime Minister rebukes China whilst holding out \u0026#39olive branch\u0026#39  Brexit bulletin: Save Penka the pregnant cow from heartless EU officialsDonald Trump ‘considering a dozen more pardons’ despite criticism that picks are politically motivatedPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaWhat England fans travelling to Russia need to be concerned aboutGiant panda found roaming streets of China\u0026#39s Sichuan ProvinceLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVSurrey sex dungeon couple must pay £45,000 after court hears they ignored order to shut downItaly\u0026#39s new populist coalition sworn in as deputy PM says expelling migrants is a priorityRoman merchant who was beheaded by flying rock while fleeing Pompeii had \u0026#39treasure trove\u0026#39 of silver coinsToday editor forced to defend gender pay gap as Martha Kearney reveals she is not paid as much as John Humphrys Democrats 2020: Could Julián Castro become America\u0026#39s first Hiic president?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/01/TELEMMGLPICT000165139084_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"indias prime minister rebukes china whilst holding olive branch","story":"India\u0026#39s Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers the keynote address at the opening of the IISS Shangri-la Dialogue, Singapore, Friday, June 1, 2018.Defence and Security correspondentNarendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, used a strong opening address at the Asia Security Summit to “hold out an olive branch” to China in a bid to reduce tension in the region.In a powerful speech Mr Modi said development should be driven by the “consent of all, not the power of a few” and called for “dialogue not force” to settle disputes.All nations must be treated equally, “irrespective of size and strength,” he said.However, his thinly-veiled attacks on China are being interpreted as no stronger than necessary and a clear signal of mutual respect to India’s regional competitor.Addressing delegates in Singapore at the summit, also known as the Shangri-la Dialogue, on Friday, Mr Modi said: “The world has a better future when India and China work together and are sensitive to each other\u0027s interests”.In a swipe at China’s determination to establish itself as the regional hegemon he urged: “Each nation must ask itself ‘are we building a new world or forcing isions?’”.Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, Senior Fellow for South Asia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said Mr Modi’s emphasis on the “rules based international order” was a clear call “for others to follow”.Mr Modi at the opening address of the Asia Security Summit. Since his election four years ago, Mr Modi has sought to nurture political and security relationships. He called India a bridge between south and south-east Asia and described “fresh energy” in relations with Australia and New Zealand. He pointed to relations with Japan as the cornerstone of India’s south-east Asia policy and said his country’s relationship with Russia had matured, to be “special and privileged”.He firmly pointed out that his country had “overcome the hesitation of history” with the United States, a reference to the strained relationship during the Cold War when India was close to the Soviet Union whilst officially non-aligned. The two countries had a shared vision of an “open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region”. Mr Modi met US President Donald Trump last year in a meeting hailed a success. Whilst hinting at rivalries in the region he sought to assuage Chinese fears. “Differences must not become disputes,” he said and stressed “friendships are not alliances of containment”.He promoted collaboration with middle-ranking powers and was a strong advocate for the Association of South East Asian Nations, the 10-member regional security body, which he described as “an example and inspiration”.Shashank Joshi, Senior Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said Mr Modi’s speech continued the work of the informal summit in April in Wuhan, China, when he met China’s President Xi Jinping.The summit, organised by the IISS, is taking place this weekend. 575 delegates from 40 countries are attending and Gavin Williamson, the British Defence Secretary, will be speaking on Sunday.Please review our commenting policyNiall Ferguson leaves Stanford role after ordering \u0026#39opposition research\u0026#39 on a student in free speech rowComment: Parents who barely know how to be parents are raising kids who can barely functionRare Iberian lynx spotted in Barcelona for first time in a century after crossing from Portugal We should applaud the end of the nuclear family, says top judgePublic vote to find \u0026#39modern day Wilfred Owen\u0026#39Donald Trump confirms North Korea summit with Kim Jong-un is back on for June 12Brexit bulletin: Save Penka the pregnant cow from heartless EU officialsDonald Trump ‘considering a dozen more pardons’ despite criticism that picks are politically motivatedPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaWhat England fans travelling to Russia need to be concerned aboutGiant panda found roaming streets of China\u0026#39s Sichuan ProvinceLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVSurrey sex dungeon couple must pay £45,000 after court hears they ignored order to shut downItaly\u0026#39s new populist coalition sworn in as deputy PM says expelling migrants is a priorityRoman merchant who was beheaded by flying rock while fleeing Pompeii had \u0026#39treasure trove\u0026#39 of silver coinsToday editor forced to defend gender pay gap as Martha Kearney reveals she is not paid as much as John Humphrys Democrats 2020: Could Julián Castro become America\u0026#39s first Hiic president?How popular is Donald Trump?

The GPS signal from a device on his collar then disappeared, and for two years, his whereabouts were unknown.He has now become the first Iberian lynx seen in Catalonia for more than a hundred years, after conservation officials tracked him down to a wooded area in Barcelona following reports of sightings.To avoid attracting curious crowds, authorities have declined to release details of his location.Conservation officials released pictures of the lynx lounging under the shade of a tree, apparently in good health and unfazed by his surroundings.They are now working with experts from IberLince, the EU-funded rehabilitation programme, on a plan to capture Lithium as he is “in an unsuitable location to guarantee his security”, close to roads and urban centres.“This is the first time the presence of an Iberian Lynx has been detected in Catalonia since the beginning of the 20th century,” they said in a statement.He was last seen two years ago in the Guadiana Valley, southeastern PortugalSanti Palazón, a biologist from the Catalan Generalitat\u0027s Flora and Fauna Service, told El Periodico newspaper that while the adventurous lynx seemed to have adapted to his environment, it made no sense to leave him in Catalonia, alone.The lynx’s trek across the Iberian Peninsula - crossing mountains, valleys and rivers - is all the more impressive given that a previous attempt to introduce him to the wild ended in failure.Born in 2014 in a captive breeding centre in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, Lithium was first released the following year but was recaptured in early 2016 as he was struggling to adapt.Showing signs of weakness, he spent a spell at an endangered species recovery centre before his second release.Iberian Lynx numbers dwindled to just 94 in 2002 but rehabilitation efforts are paying off, with 589 found in a 2017 provisional census of the species.Please review our commenting policyNiall Ferguson leaves Stanford role after ordering \u0026#39opposition research\u0026#39 on a student in free speech rowComment: Parents who barely know how to be parents are raising kids who can barely functionWe should applaud the end of the nuclear family, says top judgePublic vote to find \u0026#39modern day Wilfred Owen\u0026#39Donald Trump confirms North Korea summit with Kim Jong-un is back on for June 12India\u0026#39s Prime Minister rebukes China whilst holding out \u0026#39olive branch\u0026#39  Brexit bulletin: Save Penka the pregnant cow from heartless EU officialsDonald Trump ‘considering a dozen more pardons’ despite criticism that picks are politically motivatedPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaWhat England fans travelling to Russia need to be concerned aboutGiant panda found roaming streets of China\u0026#39s Sichuan ProvinceLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVSurrey sex dungeon couple must pay £45,000 after court hears they ignored order to shut downItaly\u0026#39s new populist coalition sworn in as deputy PM says expelling migrants is a priorityRoman merchant who was beheaded by flying rock while fleeing Pompeii had \u0026#39treasure trove\u0026#39 of silver coinsToday editor forced to defend gender pay gap as Martha Kearney reveals she is not paid as much as John Humphrys Democrats 2020: Could Julián Castro become America\u0026#39s first Hiic president?How popular is Donald Trump?

Their parents may or may not be their natural parents.They may be children of parents with very different religious, ethnic or national backgrounds. They may be the children of polygamous marriages. Their siblings may be only half-siblings or step-siblings. Some children are brought up by two parents of the same sex. Some children are conceived by artificial donor insemination. Some are the result of surrogacy arrangements.He said the growth of international relationships had been fuelled by technology and cheap airfares, while same-sex relationships which had previously been regarded as perversions to be stamped out by the more or less enthusiastic enforcement of a repressive criminal law were now treated with acceptance and respect.The most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics show that there are around 10,000 same-sex couples in the UK who have dependent children. Parental orders made as part of surrogacy arrangements have grown from less than 50 a year before 2008 to 300 a year currently. The legal low-down | Solicitor Nicola Scott’s advice for anyone thinking about surrogacyIn the speech made at Liverpool University in honour of 20th century social reformer Eleanor Rathbone, he called for family law to adapt itself to these realities and described the pace of change maddeningly slow. Last year he spoke out about funding for mental health services after finding that there was no secure place anywhere in the country for a suicidal teenage girl to go. He warned the country would have blood on our hands if she was released into the community and killed herself. He said he received criticism for the intervention but remained unrepentant.There are occasions, and this, in my judgment, was one, where a judge’s sworn duty to do “right” includes speaking truth to power, he said. Recalling the case in his speech this week, he said judges should have more power to decide what happens to children in such situations. Courts are currently barred from intervening in the work of local authorities, and Sir James called for new legislation to change this. The courts have to be properly equipped for their vital problem-solving role, he said, as judges are currently limited to the blunted weapons of persuasion and shaming. Sir James, who is due to retire next month as he turns 70, is a well-known supporter of no-fault orce, and has previously called for the family courts to become more transparent in order to increase public trust in the system. Last year he ruled that laws which restricted the use of surrogacy to couples, excluding single people, were discriminatory, prompting the Government to change them. He has also warned that too many children are being criminalised by the CPS and called for cohabiting couples to get the same rights as married people. Niall Ferguson leaves Stanford role after ordering \u0026#39opposition research\u0026#39 on a student in free speech rowComment: Parents who barely know how to be parents are raising kids who can barely functionRare Iberian lynx spotted in Barcelona for first time in a century after crossing from Portugal Public vote to find \u0026#39modern day Wilfred Owen\u0026#39Donald Trump confirms North Korea summit with Kim Jong-un is back on for June 12India\u0026#39s Prime Minister rebukes China whilst holding out \u0026#39olive branch\u0026#39  Brexit bulletin: Save Penka the pregnant cow from heartless EU officialsDonald Trump ‘considering a dozen more pardons’ despite criticism that picks are politically motivatedPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaWhat England fans travelling to Russia need to be concerned aboutGiant panda found roaming streets of China\u0026#39s Sichuan ProvinceLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVSurrey sex dungeon couple must pay £45,000 after court hears they ignored order to shut downItaly\u0026#39s new populist coalition sworn in as deputy PM says expelling migrants is a priorityRoman merchant who was beheaded by flying rock while fleeing Pompeii had \u0026#39treasure trove\u0026#39 of silver coinsToday editor forced to defend gender pay gap as Martha Kearney reveals she is not paid as much as John Humphrys Democrats 2020: Could Julián Castro become America\u0026#39s first Hiic president?How popular is Donald Trump?

Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, said more children are being potty trained at an older age, with parents struggling to teach their children over just two days at the weekend. Ms Spielman warned in a speech to nursery leaders\u0026nbsptoday\u0026nbspthat more and more children are not toilet trained when they arrive at school, adding that they “risk being teased” by classmates. Speaking to the media at the Pre-School Learning Alliance conference, the head of the schools’ watchdog suggested that nursery workers need to take a greater role in helping to potty train young children. “Without taking responsibility away from parents, if your child is in nursery every day,\u0026nbsptoilet training is not something you can do in two days over the weekend, and say boom, it is done.“In practice it becomes something that’s got to be a bit of a cooperative exercise.”Ms Spielman added that potty training used to be done by parents before a child went near formal childcare – but now the responsibility has been blurred as more children enter pre-school provision. Her warnings come after a report this week revealed that teachers lose more than a million hours every year teaching children basic hygiene and how to use the toilet.The Ofsted leader’s speech to nursery leaders this morning highlighted the rising number of youngsters who lack basic hygiene and language skills when they turn up to school at the age of four. Some parents do not appreciate the importance of early education and teaching young children life skills – such as how to communicate or use the toilet, early years experts said at the conference. There has been an increase in young children with issues such as poor language skills and there has been a lack of involvement and interaction by some parents with pre-school children, they said. Gary Jeffries, a nursery manager from Birmingham, who has 16 years’ experience in the industry, said the fact that a lot of parents were spending time on their phones had contributed to the problem.Mr Jeffries said: “I would say that not all parents value early years, and I don’t think the government values it enough.”He added that parents may need help and guidance on reading to children, how to speak to them, dietary requirements, and some “may not know where to start with things like potty training”.“I always say to my parents, if you haven’t got time to do anything at home, but have got time to do one thing, education-wise I always just say, read a bedtime story, read, read, read, talk to them, ask them questions, point things out when you’re in the supermarket, on a car journey,” he said.Melanie Pilcher, quality and standards manager for the Pre-School Learning Alliance, who has managed and worked in nurseries, said: “It’s always been the case with children that it takes longer to get dry, to potty train, but from what our members are telling us, they are finding these things are increasing.“The big issue is we have parents who need help but don’t know it. When you’ve got a parent who needs help and wants help and recognises it, then they will seek it with you and we are able to signpost.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And a decision will have to be made as to whether we accept it or not.”It adds: “It cannot be right that 650 MPs alone decide whether to accept the deal, without any say for Londoners or people across the country. That’s why we think it’s essential that there is a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, so that 65 million people can have their voices heard as well.”The letter sets out the need to stop Brexit from damaging London’s status as “a cultural capital, a sporting powerhouse” and “a hub for international business, civil society and media”.While it accepts that the 2016 referendum gave the government a mandate to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, it says ministers do not have a mandate to “force a bad Brexit deal on our city.”It argues that London, “represents all the most positive elements of being global, outward-looking, welcoming and tolerant. These values form part of the fabric of London. A bad Brexit deal risks tearing that fabric apart.”Up to now Mr Corbyn has doggedly resisted the idea of a public vote on the final deal, saying that the country should “respect” the result of the referendum in June 2016.Ten of the MPs went further\u0026nbspand backed a call for an option in any referendum to be remaining in the EU on current terms.Labour HQ declined to comment on Friday, but the Labour membership, which twice backed Mr Corbyn to lead the party, is believed to be largely against Brexit.While the exact geographical breakdown of Labour’s membership is not public data, insiders say numbers are heavily weighted towards London and other urban centres.Mr Corbyn and the most senior members of his shadow cabinet, like John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, Barry Gardiner and Sir Keir Starmer all hold seats in the capital, which overwhelmingly backed Remain in the referendum.It comes after 12 Welsh Labour MPs, including shadow ministerial aides Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi, both defied the party line to sign a similar letter.Five MPs from Labour’s heartlands in the Northeast also signed a letter published by The Independent in May calling for backing the People’s Vote campaign, as did four\u0026nbspMerseyside\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand the city’s mayor.Last month Janet Daby\u0026nbspdefeated rivals supported by the Corbyn-backing Momentum group and Unite to become Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the Lewisham East byelection next month, having stood on a ticket of fighting to keep the UK in the single market.Anti-Brexit left-wingers announced they will\u0026nbsptour\u0026nbspBritain this summer in a campaign to build opposition to leaving the EU – calling on Mr Corbyn to back Remain and negotiate a “new settlement” with Brussels.The internal struggle in the party could come to a head when the Commons votes on whether to keep the UK in the single market in coming weeks, with Mr Corbyn currently refusing to back the plan.Labour’s current position is that that Britain’s EU membership must end and that the country should leave the\u0026nbspsingle market\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcustoms union\u0026nbspto negotiate new relationships to replace them.But the House of Lords, including more than 80 Labour peers who rebelled against Mr Corbyn’s will, passed an amendment to Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Bill that would see the UK remain inside the single market if it also now gets approved by the Commons.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yulin Dog Eating Festival: MILLIONS of campaigners gather to stop itHe has been campaigning since the start and the last five years have seen him visiting Yulin\u0026rsquos dog slaughter houses, interviewing dog meat traders, supervising research projects and also rescuing cats and dogs.\u0026ldquoI was involved in the campaign against the dog meat trade in 2010 when the Yulin Dog Meat Festival was officially launched, he says.\u0026ldquoThe festival was so obnoxious and offensive to the Chinese and international animal activists that a global campaign was on the horizon.\u0026ldquoIn 2010, the Yulin Dog Meat Festival was a huge public display of humans\u0026rsquo gross inhumanity to dogs. Dogs were caged on the streets, in front of restaurants, and on the markets for the consumers to pick and slaughter in broad daylight and in front of terrified dogs and young children.\u0026ldquoIt was shocking and sad to see the Yulin officials\u0026rsquo lack of care and concern for the psychological well-being of Yulin\u0026rsquos young children.\u0026ldquoPublic slaughter of dogs celebrated as a \u0026lsquofestival\u0027 was totally offensive to even many Chinese young and educated urbanites. Since then, I have been to Yulin many time and liaised with Chinese activists on many dog rescue incidents in mainland China.NCPeter Li believes that Yulin\u0026rsquos days are numberedHe now believes that Yulin\u0026rsquos days are numbered.I am optimistic, he explains. \u0026ldquoChina outlawed foot-binding, infanticide, arranged marriage and opium-smoking. It will outlaw the dog meat trade eventually.\u0026ldquoUrbanisation and increase of disposable income have changed people\u0026rsquos attitudes towards animals. Pet keeping allows people to develop a bond not only with dogs and cats but also sympathy for other non-human animals.\u0026ldquoThe Yulin Dog Meat Festival was at its worst in 2010-2012. Since 2013, and particularly 2014, the event is a far more muted affair, and the overt signs of a typical \u0026lsquofestival\u0026rsquo are no longer present.\u0026ldquoWe used to see around 10,000 dogs being killed whereas now it\u0026rsquos more like 2-3,000 dogs, so progress is being made, albeit slowly.For more details of HSI petition, see: www.hsi.orgendyulin"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/prince-harry-968125.jpg","title":"Prince harry best man Charlie van Straubenzee royal wedding","story":"Prince Harry is to be Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s best man Harry\u0026rsquos long-time friend was an usher at his Royal Wedding to Meghan Markle and now he is set to return the favour at Mr van Straubenzee\u0026rsquos wedding to filmmaker Daisy Jenks.The pair have been close friends since their days at Ludgrove Prep School.It is believed Mr Straubenzee and his older brother, Thomas van Straubenzee, acted as ushers at Harry\u0026rsquos wedding to Meghan on May 19.At the Royal Wedding, Charlie is said to have joined Prince William to toast the newlyweds in a \u0026ldquonaughty speech during the reception, which involved playful jokes about the groom\u0026rsquos ginger hair.

STOCKAn initial \u0026pound250 voucher was given to parents when the CTF openedNearly one in three parents did not make an active decision on where this free gift was going to be placed and instead left it up to the Government to appoint a provider.This has meant many of these accounts, which could hold over \u0026pound400 million, may simply have been forgotten about.The CTF was replaced with Junior ISAs in 2011, but any account that was previously set up, along with the money in it, still exists.Research by ISA provider Scottish Friendly from 2015 found one in four of these accounts and the money held within in them, have been forgotten about.It found an estimated 1.5 million of the 6.3 million CTFs opened on behalf of children have never had any additional funds put into them outside of the Government\u0026rsquos contribution.Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst from Hargreaves Lansdown, said: You only had 60 days to decide where to put your CTF voucher, and if you were too busy to make a choice, the government would have picked one for you.It\u0026rsquos no wonder that somewhere between 900,000 and 1.5 million CTFs have been forgotten about.ISA advice from Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis.

Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its lavishly-funded Remainer stooges aim to do the same with Brexit.How does Brussels think this all ends?If Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience.In Italy, eurosceptic parties will now have an even bigger mandate.

It dived down and up again and dived and disappeared.It was not a boat. I would say it was Nessie.”The Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register, which keeps a record of every possible glimpse of Nessie, believes Eoin filmed the real deal.Gary Campbell, keeper of the sightings register, said: As far as Nessie footage goes, this is a feature film.Normally you only get videos of one or two seconds. It is remarkable in its length.Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections.But wider interest wasnt sparked until 1933 after a road was built along the loch, making it far less isolated.Within months, several people came forward claiming to have seen a giant beast lurking near the water.Theories reached fever pitch a year later when the infamous surgeon’s photograph - probably the best-known image of the creature - emerged.But in 1975 the famous shot was exposed as a hoax, made using a toy submarine with a carved monster’s head.There have now been over 1,000 reported sightings.In 2017, the story of the Loch Ness monster topped a poll of the UKs greatest unexplained mysteries.The object would be no larger than 20ft.”It follows nine sightings of the elusive beast in the last year alone.Just last week, eight-year-old Laria Annand and her gran Marie claimed to have caught Nessie on camera while going for a paddle in the iconic lake."},{"url":null,"title":"inverness primary school ends boy girl only races sports day","story":"Students at Merkinch Primary School in Inverness can now only compete in mixed races.The decision comes just weeks after new guidelines to improve inclusion for pupils who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex was sent out by the Highland Council.But some parents have raised concerns children could face more bullying by the move - while others said it was a clumsy attempt at addressing the matter of inclusion.Mother-of-two Melissa Watson said: “It was a big talking point for me and my mates.There was a race between five girls and one boy and he came last and all the boys were like ‘Ha ha,, you got beaten by a girl’.In my eyes this opens the kids up to being bullied.“Why doesn’t the school just let the LGBTI children race with the sex that they feel they belong to, instead of making all the kids run mixed races?”Another mum, who did not want to be named, added: The world has gone mad. I feel for the children in 10-15 years.I dread to think what it’s going to be like.”Other critics pointed out races at a competitive level were not mixed.Del McClurg is chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council and her grandchildren attend Merkinch Primary.The official guidelines were produced by LGBT Youth Scotland and tell teachers not to deny or overly question trans childrens choices over gender identity.It advises that if the child does not want to inform their parents or carers of their trans identity it is best to not to disclose information.The report adds that schoolkids as young as three should be supported to explore and express their identity regardless of their age.The document also says parents should not be told if their children are sharing rooms with trans pupils on school trips.She said she had “mixed feelings” about the move.Del added: “I think the school needs to explain this to the parents,” she said.“The Olympics don’t do mixed-gender competition sports.”But the school said they had mostly received praise from parents by the change.Headteacher Judith Kean was unavailable for interview but in a written response she confirmed races were mixed at the sports day held this week and that feedback from parents and children had been positive.Hugh Torrance, director of Leadership, Equality and Active Participation (LEAP) in Sports Scotland, which published the guidelines emailed by Highland Council to all schools, said: “The guidance has come about as a result of LGBTI pupils working together with schools to try and address some particularly difficult issues that pupils have experienced within physical education in particular.“We have suggested that pupils should not be segregated according to sex unless it’s necessary.“The evidence points to there being no differences between the genders when it comes to sport pre-puberty.But the manifesto is not saying that we need to do away with gender segregation completely in sport. That’s not how the world is set up at the moment.”Morgan Cowley, former chairman of the Highland LGBTI forum which campaigns for the fair treatment of all LGBTI people, said: “I think introducing non-gender specific sports days into schools is rather a clumsy way of trying to address the crux of the matter within our schools, which is promoting respect for one another and celebrating difference.“There are undoubtedly more astute ways of doing this and what Merkinch Primary is doing seems to be increasing conflict rather than reducing it.“Trying to promote nongender specific sports into schools at this point in our society’s development, when the whole world celebrates and enjoys gender-specific sport at the highest levels, seems a hard sell.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005058965-e1527844664660.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"netflix menu kate middleton escorts film menu","story":"The gaffe saw the Duchess of Cambridge kissing Prince William on the top half but the bottom half of the image was spliced with a tattooed girl in racy stockings and lace underwear.The snap, posted on Reddit by Big_Miss_Steak_, was meant to advertise documentary The Royals, which features interviews with those close to the family.But it somehow got mixed up with racy film Escorts, which is billed as provocative and steamy by Netflix.The shows synopsis reads: Get an unflinching look at two high-priced call girls who rely on the internet to find clients, and the effects of their lifestyle on their families.The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption: The risqué side of Netflix.

Some things you can pick are perfectly safe - like apples, blackberries, certain plants and even some flowers. But for the main course you might want to bring along some supermarket staples! Always be careful when using stoves. You can use them anywhere and The Woodland Trust prefer campers to use them over a campfire as they\u0027re much safer.  Fire up this camping stove for a fantastic grill - be it on the road or in your back garden for an at home adventure - which is just \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12) at Halfords. Mix up cooking things you\u0027ve brought from home with bits you\u0027ve sourced locally for a great combo. And don’t forget to pack the Halfords Rainbow Plastic Plates which are now half price at just \u0026pound3 (was \u0026pound3) to dine out in style.      If you’ve got a couple of days then you could take everyone out for a long cycle ride, broken up by either nights in a hotel or camping. If you don’t want to stay the night there are plenty of UK cycle routes – check Sustrans for those in your area – which you can drive to during the day.  Check out Halfords’ options for bike racks if you need to load your bikes onto a car – the Thule ProRide 591 is \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25), but also on buy one, get one free. That\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re looking to take a couple of bikes with you on your adventure as each rack holds one bike. And right now at Halfords you can get free fitting too.  If you have very little children then it’s also worth considering an alternative way to transport them. Halfords has a range of bike seats for juniors as well as an amazing Double Buggy Bike Trailer for \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound110, 50lbs weight limit per child, not for use with a child under 12 months old).  Little kids have an absolute blast being towed around, and you’ll hear a lot of delighted giggles and yells when you’re doing it. Make sure you also get bike helmets that fit securely for both you and your little ones. Halfords has a wide range to choose from and can help you to find the right fit. And before heading off why not get a Free Bike Check from Halfords? You can either book online or just pop in to your local store for a 32-point check. Everything from the frame to the saddle and the wheels to the gears are given a thorough check by an in-store expert. Getting the check means you can relax, knowing your bike is in great shape for your trip. Let the games begin      There are all sorts of major sporting events on this year, so why not hold some of your own competitions. You can then arrange lots of little events for your wannabe stars of tomorrow, from football and running to swimming and cycling. If you’re in need of a new bike for your young ones Halfords has a great range, including the Apollo Gridlok kids mountain bike, which has been reduced by \u0026pound31 and is now only \u0026pound124. There is 20 per cent off a whole range of kids bikes too, so there’s bound to be something that suits your little athletes.  If the kids have bikes but you don’t, perhaps it’s time to take advantage of 20 per cent off a range of adult bikes – the Carrera Vengeance is now \u0026pound264 (save \u0026pound66). Make exercise rewarding If you’ve got older kids that love nothing more than heading out on two wheels to explore with friends, then there are lots of options. Come up with a number of miles to cycle in a day, week or even month and get them a cycle computer from Halfords (starting at \u0026pound8.50). You can fit it together then dispatch them on chores! For every mile you could reward them, either with extra pocket money or just their choice of movie to watch with you later.

And if I was the Secretary of State for Defence, I would be very worried about what this 83-year-old great-great-grandmother is capable of.  After more than 20 years of struggle she got a widow\u0027s war pension after finding proof that her late husband Eric had been irradiated while flying sampling missions during Britain\u0027s nuclear tests.  Eric had piloted a converted Canberra bomber sniff plane through the mushroom cloud of our biggest hydrogen bomb when it was detonated over Christmas Island in the South Pacific. But when he got home he started to have crippling headaches. Shirley told me: One day he was holding his head with tears running down his face. He was in agony. We took him to psychiatrists but they had no idea what was wrong. Twice Shirley found and saved her husband as he tried to commit suicide. The third time, in 1976, he succeeded, slashing his wrists in a wood near their home.  Shirley was told by the MoD all of his medical records during his time at Christmas Island have disappeared. But then she discovered a radiation meter in his cockpit registered a dose of 13 Roentgen - the equivalent of 12,000 dental X-rays. Despite a series of legal hearings in which the MoD claimed Eric must have been mentally unstable because he used to wet the bed as a child, it was enough to win a war pension. But Shirley didn\u0027t stop. After the Freedom of Information Act was passed she applied for further details of Eric\u0027s service. In December 2007 they sent her a single sheet of paper which confirmed his dose of 13R, among the records of 13 other aircrew whose names and doses were blanked out. And three months after that, they sent extra documents as additional information. It contained a bombshell.  There, in black and white, it said: Thus the initial experiment was carried out on personnel flying the secondary sampler. Eric\u0027s plane, codenamed Sniff Two, was the second to enter the cloud. Eric had been subjected to an experiment.   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   At the time veterans were trying to sue the MoD for negligence. Shirley gave their lawyers the documents, but as they had more than a million papers to read it seems to have been lost. A little while ago she came across a copy and sent it on to me, because I\u0027ve been reporting on the veterans\u0027 story for the past 16 years. Like her, I\u0027ve seen a lot of these old documents. This one was about testing the film radiation badges thousands of the veterans were given during the tests, and comparing their readings to the Charlie meter which measured radiation in the cockpit. I read through it, and then I fell off my chair.   Experiment! Blimey! Three paragraphs later: Care was taken to ensure that as little shielding effect as possible was given by the ejector seat and that no equipment of any description shielded the badges. I flicked back. For the test a badge was put behind each crew member\u0027s head, on his two arm rests, and on his seat pan. So when they maximised radiation for the badges, they were maximising exposure of the men. His dose according to the badge in the centre of his chest was 13R, as we already knew. But at the bottom of the page was this:  The dose to his head was the biggest of all - almost 19R. Could it be linked to those headaches? And the specific dose to his testicles was 8.8R. You would need to work in a modern nuclear power station for about 460 years to get the same dose.  Eric has four generations of descendants. More than a third of them have an abnormality - including skull deformities, developmental problems, and extra and missing sets of teeth.  Eric knew he was flying through a mushroom cloud. He was likely aware of people testing these badges. But he wore no extra protection, and his widow is sure he was never told about a risk to his DNA. Shirley said: He never breathed a word about his missions to me, but if anyone had warned him about genetic damage he would never have let us have those children.  In February the chairman of the British Nuclear Test Veterans\u0027 Association, Alan Owen, told me four vets were returning to Christmas Island for the 60th anniversary of Grapple Y in April, and launching a medal campaign. Mirror editor Alison Philips agreed to back it, and when a friend introduced me to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson I asked him to do the same. As a former defence minister he knew of the issue, and had even tried to fix it by finding the scientific missing link the MoD had always demanded. It requires scientific method that, geneticists say, has yet to be discovered.  But Tom was only in the job six months. Now, as deputy, he has some responsibility to talk about medal-giving, so said he\u0027d throw his weight behind it. Veteran John Ward, 81, agreed to meet Tom in Parliament and talk to him about his experiences and his belief that they are to blame for his daughter Denise\u0027s extensive medical problems.   And then, with the greatest of pleasure, I rang the MoD. I\u0027ve rung them for comments a lot over the years. I usually have to explain to the press officer what nuclear veterans are before I explain the story. We\u0027ve got a document from 1958 which says personnel were used in a radiation experiment, I said. The only care taken was to ensure they weren\u0027t shielded, and the scientists knew about the possibility of genetic damage. We\u0027re running it tomorrow.  I emailed them the document. That was 9am on Tuesday morning. Over the course of the day the press office claimed the papers were just safety regulations, that it was an experiment on badges not men, and that policy documents say all kinds of stuff so it wasn\u0027t to be believed. I pointed out, repeatedly, a pilot\u0027s radiation exposure was maximised despite official awareness he might have genetic damage, and this was no blue-sky policy idea but a scientific endeavour that actually happened. An official comment landed in my inbox at 6pm. It said veterans were welcome to apply for compensation and added: At the time the military monitored the health of our service personnel and it is no surprise that selected quotes from historical documents refer to this.   1. The MoD has spent more than 30 years fighting every compensation and war pension claim brought by the veterans, at a cost to the public purse of more than \u0026pound17m 2. Monitoring their health? Really? The Mirror decided to hold the story until the next day, in the hope of a comment that actually addressed the story. At 9am, I rang the MoD again. I pointed out the word monitor did not appear in the document once, while the word experiment featured prominently. Off we went again. The press officer claimed this was evidence of keeping the men safe, and I pointed out Eric had zero protection while flying through a cloud produced by a bomb 100 times more powerful than that which levelled Hiroshima. The press officer went home, another started the evening shift, and a comment finally appeared at 8.30pm.  It said: It is not true to say that these men were subject to an experiment to look at the effects of radiation.   I didn\u0027t say it was. I said Eric was USED in an experiment involving radiation - like he was a Bunsen burner, rather than a man. I note you don\u0027t deny it.   The British nuclear testing programme contributed towards keeping our country secure during the Cold War and regular health checks were conducted throughout.  Where are the rest of Eric\u0027s records, then? You told Shirley you don\u0027t have any.      “The National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link participation in this programme to ill health.”   There\u0027s plenty of circumstantial evidence: studies have found 1 in 3 veterans had bone cancer or leukaemia, 3 times the normal rate of miscarriage, 10 times the usual number of birth defects, and elevated rates of infant death. And in 2011 a survey by THE MOD ITSELF found 83% of veterans had up to 10 different health conditions. It\u0027s just the MoD considers this evidence invalid.    We published the story on our front page on Thursday. Tom Watson went on Sky News to demand the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson apologise to Shirley, and reveal how many other nuclear veterans were involved in experiments. I did interviews on LBC, British Forces radio and Forces TV.   These are some of the messages I have had since from veterans and their families: I had five sons after Christmas Island, they\u0027re all disabled my nephew died aged 7 from leukaemia and my sister has an illness doctors cannot diagnose my dad was at Grapple and I have extra teeth too. And these, about the Mirror\u0027s splash yesterday: About to go and buy the Mirror, I wish my dad could have seen this. And: The front page! I was crying as I took it out of the stand. Dad died in 1983, still a young man, never knew his grandchildren. Best of all, though, was a phone call from Shirley. Thank you, darling. You\u0027ve done Eric proud, and told his story so well, she said. Now, what can I do to help you next?  And that\u0027s the bit Gavin Williamson should worry about. What will we do next?

Under the plan, Northern Ireland could be given joint EU and UK status and a buffer zone on its border with the Republic. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake dismissed the plan as being like something out of Alice in Wonderland”. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign against a hard Brexit, said: If there was an award for coming up with unnecessarily complicated and convoluted solutions to self-inflicted problems, David Davis would win it every year.” Jeremy Corbyn already faces firm opposition from the centre-right of his party over Brexit, with a string of moderate MPs backing a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal.  Last night, a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour members from across the party spectrum, signed a joint letter calling for an option to remain in the EU to be included in parliament’s meaningful vote on the terms of Theresa May’s divorce deal. The letter, organised by campaign group Best for Britain, was signed by a string of prominent Labour MPs including David Lammy, Tulip Siddiq, Wes Streeting, Mike Games and Neil Coyle. And the Labour leader (FRI) faces fresh pressure from the party’s left wing, as a prominent union leader urged him to “come clean with the electorate [and] say the Brexit squeeze ain’t worth the juice.” Manuel Cortes, boss of the transport union TSSA, warned Brexit would leave Labour’s working class supporters worse off.

Martha Dolak was trapped after her controlling partner Michael Goodwin locked the doors to his flat before beating her to a pulp - causing her to suffer facial and skull fractures as well as permanent damage to her optical nerves. But in a clever escape bid, the 31-year-old snapped a selfie of her horrific injuries and sent it to a friend, who immediately alerted Martha\u0027s parents and the police. The brutal attack, which took place in October last year whilst Michael\u0027s two young children were in the next room, escalated after the manipulative builder checked through Martha\u0027s phone.   Multiple casualties after car hits crowd in Greater Manchester hit and run as \u0027people flung everywhere\u0027  He saw a text from a friend she\u0027d confided in about his controlling ways, urging her to leave him. She said: When Michael saw the message he was livid. I was terrified so I tried to get my things and go. He told me I couldn\u0027t leave and both the doors were locked. I went to the window to see if I could jump out safely - but suddenly I felt an excruciating pain and remember nothing else.  I woke up in bed. I knew he must have put me there but I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t feel my legs and I had the most painful headache, I couldn\u0027t lift my head up at all. My eye wouldn\u0027t open and my face felt thick with dry blood. I took a selfie - I wanted to see what was wrong with me. I was horrified at what I saw. I sent the picture to my friend so that she would get help. It was only afterwards that I realised he had kicked me in the head.  My friend told my parents straight away, and my dad, who doesn\u0027t speak very good English, went to the police station with the text. The police went to an old address for Michael first and spoke to his sister.  She told the police I had fallen down the stairs, and then came to Michael\u0027s  new house to warn him they were on to him.  After she came they reluctantly decided to take me to the hospital. I could have died if I was left without medical attention for much longer.  After the attack Martha left Michael, 30, for good and took out an injunction against him. Martha, from London and who had been in a relationship for 18 months, added: After the attack people would say to me he\u0027s an animal - but he is not, he is a monster. I want to raise awareness and show to people that no matter how educated you are no matter how strong you look it can happen to anyone. I never expected this to happen to someone like me, I thought because I\u0027m smart, have a degree, am independent and see myself as a feminist that I would be able to see it happening.  But domestic violence does not choose someone based on those things. It\u0027s been the most horrific experience of my life but it made me stronger. I am not looking for sympathy, I just want to raise awareness of him so that other girls know what he is like. I have left Michael for good and I will never get into a another violent relationship ever again.

However he has now been \u0027unmasked\u0027 as Thomas Tommy Muscatello - an Italian-American, who grew up in New York. But the 38-year-old has slammed the claims in the Wall Street Journal, saying his interview with them omitted truths. In an interview on the day of the nuptials he told a Norwegian broadcaster that the former Suits actress should be aware that marriage in the royal family must be about keeping integrity, keeping formality and making sure that the traditions and heritage that we have as British people remain at the forefront.  And as the couple approached St. George’s Chapel on May 19, he tells France’s TF1 television in a posh British accent: “We’re making world history.”  Mace-Archer-Mills Tommy told the Wall Street Journal he loved England as a boy and had an innate feeling for British pronunciation growing up, picking up his accent in a variety of ways, primarily from visiting the UK.  His transformation into Mr Mace-Archer-Mills, he said, came from a growing realisation that he identified more as British than American. He said growing up he would end conversations by saying God save the Queen - despite living in Bolton Landing, New York. “I found where I’m supposed to be and who I am supposed to be, he said.  However, he declined to talk about his nationality, only saying that his surname was created by putting together names of friends and distant relations. And he said he had an agreement with two unrelated, elderly British people to call them his grandfather and grandmother. Talking about \u0027our\u0027 British culture during an interview with the Daily Blast he said Meghan had made a wise choice with her wedding dress because the queen does not like frivolous sorts of flesh so what Meghan wore was absolutely ideal.

Dashcam video captured the terrifying incident as it unfolded in a busy south London street. Dramatic footage shows a a blue Volkswagen pulling out from a queue of traffic and appearing to almost hit the cyclist. The Volkswagen hits an oncoming vehicle and the cyclist pulls out a massive blade, using it to try and smash the car\u0027s front window, the Croydon Advertiser reports. The driver runs off and ditches his car after the cyclist tries to open a locked door.  Police were alerted and are now trying to trace the man who was wielding the knife.

He then attempts to get into the vehicle via one of the passenger doors, but finds it is locked. The knife-wielding man then makes his way over to the other side of the car. At this point the driver gets out of the car and makes off on foot.  A Met Police spokeswoman said no one has been arrested in connection with the incident. The spokeswoman said: “We were called at around 5pm to London Road, in Croydon, after someone approached a vehicle brandishing a weapon. “With that in mind, the driver of the car has collided with another vehicle.

Fans have been counting down the minutes and this series is expected to make an even bigger splash than last year. The finale on ITV2 was watched by 3.1 million people but, as this series takes place around the football World Cup, many more could check it out this time. It sounds like an unlikely TV smash, watching singletons looking for love in the sun while you sit in your PJs on the couch, but bosses are pouring money into it. “It is easily our number one show,” controller of ITV digital channels Paul Mortimer says, “so we are investing in it a bit more heavily.” With versions launched in other countries, and fans including Liam Gallagher and Stormzy, here’s what all the fuss is about...  Love Island starts with a 95-minute special at 9pm on Monday on ITV2.   The presenters Caroline Flack will welcome a new generation of islanders and speak to the evicted contestants packing their suitcases and heading home. But Caroline, below, flies in and out of the island throughout the series and arguably the biggest star of the show isn’t even seen on screen. Comedian Iain Stirling is the commentator – think the voice of Big Brother with sass and humour if you’ve not watched before – and he tells us what is going on in each episode with his tongue in his cheek. Iain only sees the footage for each episode at around 2pm and then has just a few hours to write a script filled with trademark gags – and then record it. He’s rightly become a huge star since he started to voice the show. “I’ve tried to see as little as possible,” he said, when asked what he thought of the line-up. “I try and watch as a viewer.”  How it works Every few days the islanders have to couple up, with those not in a couple at risk of being dumped from the island. But it is not just a case of 11 contestants going in and a winning couple at the end – that would be far too simple. Bosses say the path to true love is “littered with surprise bombshell arrivals” meaning by the end of the eight-week run there will have been more than 20 contestants. There will also be unexpected twists and turns like shock evictions, games, dates and bosses meddling. Most of this news is delivered to contestants via text message on one of their phones, often leading to screams of: “I’ve got a text!” And if two people fancy the same person? Bring on battles for affection and lots of gossiping in the garden.  Sex on TV Parents of contestants will want to look away and invest in ear plugs when their precious ones are doing the deed. While the footage of sex is not graphic – most couples go under a duvet - what you hear is often worse. Couples are also given the chance to spend a night in The Hideaway, a private bedroom where they can have some alone time... with the cameras still on. Bosses insist they don’t show anything graphic. “For the record, we don’t show sex on television” said ITV Studios MD Angela Jain. “We show the reaction to sex happening in the villa. “The way we cut it and treat it is part of a normal relationship. We don’t do it for any kind of salacious outcome.”  The contestants A total of 11 contestants will enter the show to begin with, all single and looking to mingle. They will then “couple up”, leaving one person the odd one out. The line-up includes a West End performer, personal trainer Adam Collard, model Hayley Hughes, an A\u0026ampE doctor and the daughter of EastEnders hardman Danny Dyer. The majority of the five women entering have had their hearts broken in the past 12 months and all of them hope they will finally find “the one” on the TV show where they have up to eight weeks to date. More than 100,000 people applied to go on the show this year but many of the contestants are offered up by agents or scouted from their social media profiles.  Bosses started with a “shortlist” of 1,000 and execs saw most of these themselves after casting agents narrowed it down. Love Island 2017 was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay, although the couple split months after winning a \u0026pound50,000 prize. Kem and his co-star Chris Hughes, who came third with Olivia Attwood, went on to land a spin-off series and released a top 20 single, earning big money off the back of the success of last summer’s show.  The villa The villa is less than an hour’s drive from Palma airport in Majorca. It is the same one used last year. Camera runs in the garden are hidden in huts either side of an infinity pool and LEDs which can change colour are all around the garden floor. Executive producer Tom Gould said: “The sun deck is different and has changed in a new re-imagined space and there is a swing seat. “It makes it more attractive for them and it’s better for us to film. The hideaway has had its annual makeover. And the bedroom. “There is an inside-out theme, too. We have grass on the walls inside. And that new design has been picked up in the bedroom and lounge, to tie the whole thing as one. “On the walls and by the beds there are phrases and stuff that have been said before like ‘You OK, Hun?’ and now have a life of their own...” A smoking area has also had to be created after there were complaints last year.  Paul Mortimer says: “Because they’re a very sexy cast in a  sexy environment on a sexy channel then it made smoking look glamorous.  “Ofcom took a view that it was unacceptable. It’s not against the law to smoke cigarettes but this year we have in plan a place for the smoking area to be outside the villa rather than inside.”   The lingo  The show is well known for introducing a range of words into the nation’s vocabulary, including...  Grafting Focusing your attention on the boy/girl you want and working to woo them.   Muggy If you are doing something bad or disrespectful.   Melt Acting soppy.   Pied off When you are shot down or basically rejected.   Stick it on Make a move on a boy/girl.   My type on paper A perfect match.

The vendor, known locally as Rose Woman, was in the pub when she passed a flower to a young couple. But as the pair posed for a snap being taken by their friend Abbie Morley, the OAP put her hand down the photographer\u0027s vest top. The apparent theft bid went completely unnoticed at the time and only emerged when Declan Teasdale checked his footage. Declan, from Middlesbrough, North Yorks, posted the footage to social media with the caption: I can\u0027t believe the Rose Woman just shot her hand down Abbie\u0027s t**s. Declan added the hashtag top robber.  The clip, filmed at the Middlesbrough\u0027s Central Bar last weekend, begins with Abbie sitting down while the flower seller hands a rose to another girl. Abbie, who is facing away from the woman, takes a picture as the woman with the rose poses with a man. The video clearly shows the flower seller slip a hand inside Abbie\u0027s top while staring straight ahead at the couple being photographed. Most viewers believed the flower seller was searching for cash.

Rangers right-back James Tavernier has been criticised by animal welfare advocates for pictures of ear-cropped dogs posted on his breeding business\u0027 Instagram page.  The defender recently unveiled his new enterprise, Designer Bullies UK, which breeds beefed-up American bullies for the market, the Daily Record reported .  Some dogs can fetch prices of up to \u0026pound5,000. Despite ear-cropping being banned in the EU and UK, the 26-year-old proudly poses on his social media account with dogs whose ears have been cut off with scalpels to make them fit in with the fierce image of the breed.  Tavernier’s agents were asked if the ear-cropping was done in the UK or abroad but did not respond on Thursday night.   The same day, the Scottish SPCA released a warning that ear-cropping is getting out of control, with “a worrying increase” in the number of the dogs coming into their care after tip-offs. The charity’s chief superintendent Mike Flynn stressed role models like Tavernier who post photos of “mutilated” dogs on social media should think again. He said: “Role models promoting these dogs across social media need to give serious thought about the impact of their actions. Encouraging this illegal mutilation of dogs purely for ‘status’ is incredibly damaging and quite frankly irresponsible.” He added: “Ear-cropping is cruel and unnecessary. It’s a vanity procedure that brings no benefit to the dogs involved and increases the risk of on-going health problems and infections.”   The charity’s red alert came as the Record revealed an explosion in illegal backstreet operations on American bullies, which were originally bred from American pit bulls and Staffordshire terriers.  Procedures are carried out by dog owners in their homes with makeshift scalpel, suture and anaesthetic kits bought on the internet. An undercover special investigations unit chief inspector from the charity said: “Two years ago, we didn’t have a single American bully in our care. “However, we’re now seeing a worrying increase in the number of these dogs seized as a result of our investigations. The recent increase is entirely down to the current trend to own these dogs as a status pet. “In the UK, any surgical procedure carried out for purely aesthetic purposes is illegal. Ear-cropping is one of these procedures. A common misconception is these dogs are bred for fighting but that is not the case.”  Tavernier, who signed for Rangers from Wigan in 2015, has spoken about his dog-breeding business, which is registered in Scotland with his co-director Jake Chapman. The defender claims to have loved dogs since childhood, when he had two family pets called Rio and David after Man United star Rio Ferdinand and Dutch superstar Edgar Davids. He told a press conference, where the issue of mutilated ears was never brought up: “This is something I have started with a friend who I have known since I was three. “We decided to start a business about these dogs and it is going really well at the minute. I’m enjoying it and enjoying being around the dogs. “None of my team-mates have bought one yet but I know Josh (Windass) is looking for a dog so I might try to persuade him.” Tavernier has had to look after up to six dogs at a time as the breeding cycle gets into full throttle. He said: “It runs like any other business. You have to make calls and do the rest. But it’s enjoyable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i couldnt see hear father","story":"News\u0027I couldn\u0027t see or hear\u0027: Father describes terrifying lightning strike that threw him across his bedroom and burnt down his houseRomford father Paul Robinson, 51, was sitting at his desk when lightning struck through the window and threw him across the room\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTommy Wathen09:23, 1 JUN 2018NewsThe lightning strike set Paul Robinson\u0027s house on fire (Image: Essex Live)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father has described the terrifying moment a bolt of lightning struck his house, setting it on fire and destroying all his possessions. Paul Robinson, 51, said he was sitting at a desk in his bedroom around 1am Sunday when lightning struck his window. The impact was so overwhelming he temporarily lost his eye-sight and hearing.  He told Essex Live : I just heard the loudest sound that I’d ever heard in my life.  “I didn’t know what had happened, but I did realise that I was no longer sitting at my desk and was now over near the doorway to the landing.  I don’t remember if I was blown across or stumbled across but I just don’t remember getting there. “I do remember thinking that I couldn’t see and that I couldn’t hear either. Paul had been renting two rooms at a property in Romford. One of the rooms he occupied was the attic room, which he shared with his 32-year-old wife Anna, while his two-year-old daughter Jasmine’s room was on the first floor. Dozens of fire-fighters rushed to the property and reported the entire second floor loft room and half the first floor of the property were damaged.  Paul, Anna and Jasmine, along with their landlord Dave, had already fled the house. Miraculously, neither Paul or Anna were in their bed, which is immediately adjacent to the window that was struck. Paul was at his desk and Anna was downstairs with their daughter. Paul continued: “I then realised that I hadn’t lost all my senses because I could smell and the first thing I could smell was burning. I didn’t know where it was coming from because I couldn’t see anything. “I staggered around the room wondering what I was going to do, which was when my sight started slowly coming back to me and I noticed a fire at the end of my bed. “My first thought was to go downstairs and check out my daughter’s room. I went to go and put the light on and the light switch had been blown off the wall and it was just hanging by the wiring. “I told my wife to grab the baby and get out the house. I didn’t leave straight away as I wanted to make sure they got out first and then Dave started coming up the stairs as he must have heard me calling for water, but I told him not to bother and to just get out the house. Paul says that he then started to feel light-headed because the house filled up with smoke.  He said: This is when I knew it was time to get myself out quickly. “There was quite a crowd gathered outside, as everyone had been woken by our neighbour’s houses shaking and car alarms were going off. “I also had a collection of snakes that we were trying to breed rarer colour forms. We were then going to sell them as a business to create the deposit for our own home. “They all died in the fire but I wasn’t really thinking of them as if I had, I probably wouldn’t have had time to get out myself. “It is good that your emotions kick in during times like that and you realise what actually means a lot to you because we couldn’t save everything and I’m glad we didn’t. But it is not the only time Paul and Anna have been caught up in a disaster zone. He said: Five years ago when I got married, we were in the Philippines when they had the worst typhoon in recorded history and we survived that. “In England, you live in homes built of bricks that are meant to survive any weather, but you then find that you are wrong.” The only things that Paul and his family now own is his car and some clothes and cuddly toys donated to him by members from his local church and friends.  “I don’t know what our options are now because we don’t have the money to go out and pay a market rent, he said. “The council will not home us because my wife is not a UK national having only been here for four years and needing to have been here for six, so it limits our options. “Our friends were going on holiday the day after the fire and had been let down by a house sitter, so luckily we were able to stay there. They are back on Monday though so I don’t know what we’ll do from there. “We knew that our room was 100 per cent fire damaged, but we held on to the hopes that some our stuff in the room below may have been salvageable but when we went back to the house, everything was 100 per cent water damaged. “The bishop put aside some money for us to go out and replace some clothes that we’d lost and they had passed round a calendar to mark down days to provide meals. “It is strange how a disaster brings the best out of people. Like in journalism and when I was in the police force, you often see the absolute worst in some people that are out there, so it is nice to see the other side of human nature. “We have nice neighbours and friends within our church community that have really helped to restore our faith in humanity.

A witness claims more than 100 people were on the pavement watching cars ‘drift’ around the roundabout – known in as ‘Magic Roundabout’ - in Trafford Park when a vehicle careered into them. A 23-year-old man was taken to hospital with \u0027minor\u0027 injuries and has since been released. A man has been arrested following the crash, on Europa Way at around 9.50pm on Thursday night.  The driver failed to stop, police said. A blue BMW 330D believed to have been involved in the collision was later found in neighbouring Salford. This morning a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision. This afternoon, a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.  North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said those injured were in their 20s and 30s and they were taken to Salford Royal Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary. Car meets are often held at Trafford Park. Jamie Brown, 23, was standing nearby when the crash happened and ran to help those injured. Jamie, from Radcliffe told the Manchester Evening News: “There was well over 100 people there, probably about five to 10 cars taking part. “People were drifting around the roundabout.  “I was stood where the crash happened literally about a minute before, then my mate said let’s go back to the car and go. “As we got to the car I heard a huge bang and turned around and saw what had happened. “People were screaming, it was chaotic. I ran over to see what was going on. It was horrific.” There is no evidence to suggest that this is terrorism related at this stage. GMP’s Chief Superintendent Wayne Miller, said: “The men we arrested remain in custody and we continue to question them as part of our investigation.

Lewis Massie, 20, was giving evidence at the trial of Dean Reynolds, who is accused of killing Michael “Mikey” McLean, 17, at Denholm MacNamee, Aberdeenshire. Lewis had been working with Mikey and Reynolds, 23, in the paint tent on August 14, 2015, but left before the incident. He told the High Court in Aberdeen Mikey had gone inside a giant spooler drum - – a large machine used to lower cables into the sea from oil platforms - they were refurbishing to start painting it. Reynolds is alleged to have operated the machine at while Michael was inside the drum of the spooler. Richard Goddard, prosecuting, asked Lewis, of Keith, Banffshire, if there were any plans to “carry out pranks for Mikey on his last day”. Lewis said he wasn’t aware of any, adding: “Dean isn’t really a practical joker.”  On the first day of the trial on Wednesday, a witness told of the moment he came across the injured schoolboy. Brian Ritchie, managing director of Denholm MacNamee, said he rushed to the scene after a staff member told him Michael McLean, 17, was “unconscious”. Brian, 49, said: “I thought he was dead. He was blueish-white and bleeding from the ear.” Earlier, Dean Reynolds, who denies the culpable homicide of Michael, told the court that the teenager might have “choked on his chewing gum”. Michael died in hospital six days after sustaining “severe” injuries in the drum of the massive cable spooling machine at the oil industry services firm. The first day of Reynolds’s trial on Wednesday heard that Michael was working at the firm – where his dad was a procurement manager – and was on his last day on Friday August 14, 2015, before he was due to return to school. But at 12.20pm that day, bosses were alerted to an “emergency” in a paint shed at the yard in Inverurie Business Park, Aberdeenshire.

Hospital clerical worker Eoin O’Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam. The creature moves from right to left and as it swims towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen diving and surfacing with water splashes. The sighting - the second record accepted this year by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register - comes only days before DNA sampling is to be used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness. Eoin, 53, from Drumdoit Castlefin has wached the Nessie webcam for many years. “I just click in now and then for 20 minutes - it’s better than watching Coronation Street,” he said. “I seen a couple of things over the years but they have been explained as a boat or something else.” But on April 30, Eoin had “a terrific shock.”  “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said. I just started recording it on my phone. I just followed it.  It was very unusual, it was certainly something big - it dived down and up again and dived and disappeared. It was not a boat and not a log. I would say it was Nessie. “I believe in Nessie but not as a plesiosaur - but as something that has evolved in Loch Ness over thousands of years.” Mr O’Faodhagain has been to Loch Ness four times as part of Highland holidays. Gary Campbell, Keeper of the Official Register of Sightings at Loch Ness, said: As far as Nessie footage goes this is a feature film.  Normally you only get videos of one of two seconds. It is remarkable in its length and again shows the increased sightings of Nessie from the internet. “Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections. It is unexplained. The object would be no larger than 20ft. There is something there on the video that is clearly moving.”  Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year. Nessie’s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century. Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Since then there have been 1080 officially logged sightings. This month a team of scientists will collect tiny fragments of skin and scales from the loch. Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. He said a “biological explanation” might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. Maybe there’s a biological explanation for some of the stories,” he said.

The top photo is for a show called The Royals, using the iconic snap of Kate and Wills kissing on their wedding day, with the bride looking stunning in her white dress and veil. The bottom image is for a documentary called Escorts and shows a woman standing in just her pants and a pair of stockings. She\u0027s holding two bottles of bubbly and is covered in tattoos.   Reddit user Big_Miss_steak_ posted the bizarre photo online with the caption: The risque side of Netflix.  It looks like the line up happened as both programmes come under the documentaries category.

The 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO - the Holy Grail model - won the Tour de France Automobile in 1964, which is one of the world’s most famous and historic motor races. It is a 174mph road-legal racing car and one of only 36 built between 1962 and 1964. For years the Ferrari has been based in Germany but shown and driven at events around the world. The Ferrari, known as 4153 GT, has now been sold for $70 million - a record-breaking figure for a car.  Leading Ferrari historian Marcel Massini, who described the car as one of the top three or four GTOs in the world, confirmed it had been bought by an American businessman. Mr Massini added he was confident a GTO would be sold for $100 million within five years. During the 1990s, the GTO was restored by Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering. The bluechip car specialist wasn\u0027t involved in the \u0026pound52 million deal. But James Cottingham, vehicle acquisition specialist at DK Engineering, said: This is without doubt one of the best 250 GTOs in existence in terms of history and originality. Its period competition is very good. It won the Tour de France which is big tick and was fourth overall at Le Mans which was a mega result. It was raced by Ecurie Francorchamps, who are one of the most iconic and famous independent Ferrari teams, it has never had a big accident and it is highly original.

CCTV footage shows the gang taking Nong Gift, 21, out of the bar where she had been watching the Champions League final with friends last Saturday in Chanthaburi, Thailand. The cosmetics seller passed out inside the pub - with relatives claiming she had been drugged - and was carried out at 2am and put in the back of a pick-up truck by four men who it\u0027s said claimed they would take her home. But the men - including one who is said to have known her - drove her to a secluded orchard where she was \u0027repeatedly raped\u0027 before being beaten to death.  The gang - Nattaphong Saenkraud, 24, Patti Boonthal, 23, Panya Chan Somdee, 18, and Surasit Jaechim, 24 - are reported to have confessed their involvement to police. On Wednesday they were taken on a crime re-enactment. CCTV shows them - with the help of a female friend of Nong who is said to be the one who thought the group would take her home - carrying her out of the Orbit Pub and putting her into the back of a truck. Police Major General Charn Jitjunjun said: The victim was found dead on the same night. Four men have been arrested and confessed to their part in the crime. The victim was raped by four people and we believe beaten until she died. Her body was found with foam around her mouth, a nose bleed and part of her clothes on the floor.\u0027  A devastated friend who had been with Nong earlier in the evening said she had left her with the group of men because she thought they were her friends. There were also women in the group when she left including the woman who helped to carry Nong into the truck. Airziz Opachat, who left at 1.40am some 30 minutes before her friend passed out, said: I\u0027m sorry. If we knew that last night was the last time we were together. I will take care of you better. I\u0027m sorry I did not take care of you better. Nong had been with three other women while watching the football match but only knew one of them, Airziz Opachat, well, according to local media. They had been on holiday together in the past and socialised regularly, it was reported. The other girls all left earlier in the evening and Airziz said that Nong didn\u0027t seem very drunk. She added: Nong already knew one of the men. She was friendly with everyone. It was normal for her to be out chatting with people.  I thought that she had arrived with these men and was friends with them. Between us we had all drank about half a bottle of whiskey. I woke up in the morning and didn\u0027t see any message from Nong. The only message was from a man that said \u0027your friend is dead\u0027. Nong\u0027s body was found in the fruit processing area. The four men were arrested later on Sunday, May 27, afternoon after police viewed CCTV and tracked them down. During the crime re-enactment the four men were taken to the bar, shown loading a woman into their truck and taken to warehouse at the orchard where the attack happened. One of the group, Surasit Jaechim, the man who knew her, claims he only drove her and the other men to the area where she was killed. All men have been held in custody. Police are now carrying out post mortem examinations on Nong\u0027s body to discover whether she was drugged and the exact cause of her death.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg

business at home then started renting spaces in salons.”In 2016 Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer but still carried on creating her nail masterpieces from her home when she felt well

But they never gave me those minutes on the pitch so I was a bit annoyed at how it ended down there.“It’s just about finding a manager that will put that trust in me.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ray mckinnon aims to lure dundee united assistant laurie ellis to morton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon’s first act as Morton manager could be to raid former employers Dundee United for the services of assistant boss Laurie Ellis.Out of work since being sacked by the Tangerines in October, McKinnon has beaten off stiff competition from an impressive list of candidates to be named as Ton boss on Wednesday.And it’s understood he wants to team up with Ellis for a third time.The pair worked together at Raith Rovers for a season and then moved to Tannadice in 2016.Although McKinnon was dismissed with United five points off the top of the Championship, Ellis’s services were retained and he was appointed caretaker manager.During that period he actually led them back to the top of the league and was approached by several senior member of the team who urged him to apply for the manager’s job on a permanent basis.He declined because at this stage of his coaching career he felt he lacked the experience to be in charge of a club the size of United and resumed his duties as No 2 when Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November.Despite big changes to both the playing squad and backroom staff at Tannadice being planned this summer, including the expected appointment of Csaba’s long-time assistant Werner Burger, it’s understood Ellis has been told he’ll continue to have an important role working with the first team.He may, though, find the chance to team up again with his close friend McKinnon very difficult to turn down.United, meanwhile, have appointed a new head of finance in the shape of chartered accountant Iain Ross.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/59fc45c3606dd-846x564.jpg ","title":"ray mckinnon has no regrets over his spell at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon insists he does not have a point to prove to former club Dundee United after taking over at Greenock Morton.The 47-year-old was axed as Tannadice boss back in October with his side five points adrift of eventual Ladbrokes Championship winners St Mirren.But the man who replaced him, Csaba Laszlo, was unable to inspire the Tangerines to better, with his side crashing out of the promotion battle in the play-off semi-finals.But McKinnon insists his only motivation for taking up his new role at Cappielow is to guide Ton to the Premiership.McKinnon \u0026#8211 who has been handed a one-year rolling deal by chairman Crawford Rae \u0026#8211 said: \u0026#8220After six months out I was getting extremely bored \u0026#8211 there is only so much you can do in the house.\u0026#8220But I\u0026#8217m delighted to be back.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Anthony O’Connor’s contract with the Dons expired yesterday and midfielder Greg Tansey has two years left on his Dons deal but has been told he is free to move on this summer.The Reds made a bid to sign Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch, currently with Scotland in Mexico.Aberdeen offered to make McGeough the highest paid player at the club but Hibs also pitched in with an improved new contract.McGeouch is also being tracked by Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Brentford. New Rangers boss Steven Gerrard is also reportedly weighing up a move for McGeouch.McInnes has already landed 18-year-old Hamilton midfielder Lewis Ferguson on a pre-contract agreement.The Dons boss is also keen on securing Ross County full-back Jason Naismith. Burton Albion and Plymouth Argyle are also interested in Naismith, 23, who has two years left on his Staggies deal and would require a fee.McInnes said: “I’m excited we have good young ones coming through to add to the good players we already have.“But I do think we need more tried and tested players with that level of experience in key positions.”Meanwhile, Dons skipper Graeme Shinnie is in line to start for Scotland against Mexico on Sunday (1am).The Scots will face the World Cup-bound Mexicans at the 87,000 sell-out Azteca Stadium.Shinnie earned a debut cap as a substitute in Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat to Peru in Lima.Scotland boss Alex McLeish said: “We will need to make changes as there is no way the other guys can recover in time. You could see we were flagging.“We have to be hard to beat but we’d like to have a bigger threat at the other end.“It’s not an easy task to bring in guys who people might argue you wouldn’t normally see play for Scotland.“I am so proud of them and am looking forward to seeing the new ones coming in for the Mexico game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming. We had the best day ever!” Have you been married recently and would love to feature your big day?

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

However, all seven recycling centres will be closed for one weekday at least to allow this to happen.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoWe believe this will mean the service better meets the needs of the Borders public at our recycling centres, as well as ensuring savings can be made at in a time when budgets are tighter than ever and demands for services are increasing.\n\u0026ldquoThe review was approved by council as part of its 2018-19 budget and is expected to be introduced in late 2018.
